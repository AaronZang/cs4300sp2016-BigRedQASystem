2
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,582
             Grrr!

3
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:29,161
     - What happened here?
  - Can you be more specific?

4
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:33,399
   Oh, the mess. Funny story.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,235
  It all began at Meh Burger.

6
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:37,703
    Adequate burgers today.

7
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,506
    Yeah, you can barely taste
     the shredded newspaper.

8
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:44,076
   Ugh! I said no mayonnaise!

9
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,345
             Aargh!

10
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:50,449
        Grrr! Oh, come on!
      I don't act like that.

11
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:53,285
 Hey, who's telling this story?

12
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,686
   So, where was I? Oh, yeah.

13
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,190
      We were so embarrassed
    by Amy's uncouth behaviour

14
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,491
    that we left Meh Burger.

15
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,226
            - Grrr!
             - Oh!

16
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,966
      Everything OK, miss?

17
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,368
           Are you...

18
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,571
   Yep, I'm Sonic the Hedgehog,
    fastest hero in the world.

19
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:16,442
  Purveyor of justice. Righter
of wrongs. Eater of chilli dogs.

20
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,343
             Ohhh!

21
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,614
  Calm down, Perci. It's just
  all your dreams coming true.

22
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:26,085
       - I'm so sorry.
- Don't worry, I'm used to it.

23
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:29,021
   Just breathe slowly and tell
    Uncle Sonic what happened.

24
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,590
 Clearly she fell off her bike
       and hurt her arm.

25
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:35,327
 Amy, don't be jealous because
I'm paying attention to another.

26
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,664
        Don't mind her,
she kind of has a thing for me.

27
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,666
        - Who wouldn't?
           - Exactly.

28
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,968
     Let's see what we can do
       about that bicycle.

29
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,537
 Knuckles, bring it over here.

30
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,408
       That's a boulder.
        I said bicycle.

31
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,144
   But I'm not angry because
   I know you're a simpleton.

32
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,545
      Thank you, Mr Sonic.

33
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,549
          Oh, my, Perci,
       you've been injured.

34
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:01,120
 I know what to do about that.
 Lecture you on bicycle safety.

35
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,554
   First, never ride a bi...

36
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,291
   Amy, what Perci really needs
     is a splint for her arm.

37
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,129
   Wow, you sure know how to
take charge of every situation.

38
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,332
           And voilà!

39
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,069
   I couldn't find a bicycle,

40
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,505
      but maybe one of us
  could ride this to get one.

41
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,976
    Sorry about your scarf.

42
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,145
      I should have known
        I'd mess it up.

43
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:30,516
  I always do when I'm not under
   Sonic's direct supervision.

44
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,617
              Huh.

45
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,253
   As a man I could fix this
      with my bare hands.

46
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,622
    But it would be quicker
    with the proper tools.

47
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,590
      To Tails' workshop!

48
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:45,197
 Hey, watch out for that robot.

49
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,598
     I'll bet she's a spy,

50
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,701
     broadcasting our secrets
   to her mechanical overlords.

51
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:53,672
      You know, the ones who
  make the microwave blink 12:00

52
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,376
          even though
   you just set it yesterday!

53
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,511
             Aargh!

54
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,347
  Don't pay attention to her.
   She's actually very nice.

55
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:03,582
             Tails?

56
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,250
     I guess he isn't here.

57
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,519
           No matter,
I'll heroically repair this bike

58
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,355
    with only my bare hands
      and a welding laser.

59
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,158
  - Amy, tend to Perci's injury.
             - Mm-hm.

60
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:16,161
 Knuckles, you clean the scarf
 that you so carelessly ruined.

61
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,674
              Tails'
   industrial-strength lab kiln

62
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:32,044
   seems like the perfect place
 to dry a frilly delicate scarf.

63
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,318
 This heating pad isn't enough.

64
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,153
 Knuckles, get Perci a pillow.

65
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,655
    You're not the boss of me.
            Sonic is.

66
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,191
 But I'm bossy and overbearing

67
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,193
      and I need everyone
        to do what I say

68
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,028
         to compensate
      for my insecurities.

69
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:54,399
     Don't throw it at me,
     hand it to me nicely.

70
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,705
    Kids, behave yourselves!

71
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,441
       This is why we can't
    have nice things. (Sniffs)

72
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,052
   So I stepped into action,
          Sonic-style,

73
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,354
      and put out the fire

74
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,490
        caused by Knuckles
 putting that scarf in the kiln.

75
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:22,995
   That's not what happened.
 I'll tell you the real story.

76
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,564
         It had been days
    since I last laid my eyes

77
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,666
 upon the elusive white whale.

78
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,469
      We're talking about
 what happened to my workshop.

79
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:31,670
       I'm getting there.

80
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,007
      So, the white whale
  had just trashed Meh Burger.

81
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,408
   Wait. I'm the white whale?

82
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,611
  Shh! We were heading back home
    when we came across Perci.

83
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,315
             As usual
  Sonic made a fool of himself.

84
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:46,118
  Hi, I'm Sonic the Hedgehog.

85
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,953
      Never heard of you.

86
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,160
     But who's your friend?

87
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,362
   I'm just a humble echidna,

88
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,265
   which is why I won't brag
     about my boyish charm,

89
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,935
     unimaginable strength
and ability to think real good.

90
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,504
   You know, smartness-wise.

91
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,640
           (Grunting)

92
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,276
             Whoa!

93
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:15,213
               Wow!
   Muscles and brain-smartness.

94
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,215
           - I know.
             - Ugh!

95
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,584
         Medic, splint up
     this pretty lady's arm.

96
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,888
   I hope I can live up to your
 expectations, Captain Knuckles.

97
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:28,226
            Oh, Amy,
you've forgotten what an arm is.

98
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,529
        This is an arm.

99
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,999
Wow, you are the whole package.

100
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,168
 And here's the gift-wrapping.

101
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,004
              Ohh!

102
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,174
           (Grunting)

103
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,275
              Ugh!

104
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:46,478
            (Gasps)

105
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:50,015
      Sonic, you clumsy oaf.
     Perpetual second banana.

106
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,383
     Look what you've done.

107
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,051
         Come, my lady.

108
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:57,055
  We must go to Casa de Tails
    to repair your bicicleta

109
00:05:57,123 --> 00:06:00,192
           before Sonic
     does any further damage.

110
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:04,363
  Come on, guys, wait for me!

111
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,965
 Hey, be careful of that alien.

112
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,601
   She'll abduct our livestock,
    phone home from our houses

113
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,270
and turn us all into pod people.

114
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:17,075
  It's a cookbook! A cookbook!

115
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,643
             Aargh!

116
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,013
  Don't pay attention to her.
   She's actually very nice.

117
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,217
          Ohh! Aargh!

118
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:28,086
              Sonic!
   Can't you do anything right?

119
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,122
Your scarf will look brand-new,

120
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,958
       but it'll never look
     as lovely as its owner.

121
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,430
How does this heating pad work?
            (Groans)

122
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,034
  A pillow for my maiden fair?

123
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:46,171
      Hey, I'm the medic.
   I'll give her the pillow.

124
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,572
 I want to give her the pillow

125
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,375
          so I can be
  more like my hero Knuckles.

126
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,477
          (Both grunt)

127
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:54,946
              Agh!

128
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,189
   And so I put out the fire
      using my ice-breath.

129
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,426
 It started when Amy threw the
heating pad on those newspapers.

130
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,294
  She's not very brain-smart.

131
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:13,331
  That's not how it went at all.
   I'll tell you what happened.

132
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,302
We all agreed the service at Meh
Burger was terrible, so we left.

133
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,271
 That's when we ran into Perci,

134
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,107
        with her little
    damsel in distress act.

135
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:26,445
    I seem to have fallen from
  my bicycle and injured my arm.

136
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:31,082
  If only there were some heroic
   gentlemen to rescue poor me.

137
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,952
        - (Both giggle)
        - You're pretty.

138
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,123
Would one of you handsome young
men kindly retrieve my bicycle?

139
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:42,227
  (Both panting and grunting)

140
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,428
            - Whoa!
            - Ugh!

141
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,034
    Even with my friends under
   the spell of a wicked siren,

142
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:52,537
  I selflessly administered
medical care to the temptress.

143
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,607
   Oh, you poor sweet thing.

144
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,709
Allow me to tend to your wounds.

145
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,983
Now, let's see to your bicycle.
 I know where to get it fixed.

146
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,387
           Watch out
   for that government agent!

147
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:13,024
     It starts with jury duty
      and zoning ordinances

148
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,093
and before you know it... boom,

149
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,196
  our tax dollars are benefiting
        others and not us.

150
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,233
  Don't pay attention to her.
   She's actually very nice.

151
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,034
             Aargh!

152
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,136
    Sweetie, you rest here.

153
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,539
      I'll get a heating pad
  to make you more comfortable.

154
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,976
    Knuckles, would you please
         clean the scarf?

155
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:35,347
  And, Sonic, maybe it'd be best
     to just wait for Tails.

156
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,649
No way. I can totally fix this.

157
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,051
       Watch this, babe.

158
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,190
        My poor little arm
          is aching so.

159
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,493
    If only I had a cushion
      on which to rest it.

160
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:51,963
        (Both grunting)

161
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,231
     Let me give it to her!

162
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,000
She wants me to give it to her!

163
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,502
         (Both) Aargh!

164
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:06,545
 As the only mature one in the
 room, I extinguished the fire,

165
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:10,081
which started when Sonic forgot
to turn off his welding laser.

166
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,349
     You're making that up!

167
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,051
          - Reckless!
      - A scarf in a kiln?

168
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,321
  I can't help being attractive.
   It's a blessing and a curse.

169
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,458
 You'd think with three stories
 one of you would get it right.

170
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,627
       Now, let me tell you
     how it really happened.

171
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,630
    I had a minor accident
    with my bicycle when...

172
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:30,101
  Hi, I'm Sonic the Hedgehog,
      hero extraordinaire.

173
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,238
    You don't have a wrench
  I could use to fix my bike?

174
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:37,242
  No, but maybe I could interest
    you in some gift-wrapping?

175
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,477
           - That's OK.
      - I can fix your bike.

176
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:40,545
          No, I will.

177
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,249
You're just loving this, aren't
you? Having men fight over you.

178
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,418
          A modern woman
   could take care of herself.

179
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,253
   I can take care of myself,

180
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,255
         but like I said,
     I don't have any tools.

181
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,623
       And I hurt my arm.

182
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,992
     I suppose you need me
  to bandage that up for you?

183
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,360
    No, it's just a bruise.

184
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,195
            (Groans)

185
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,632
        (Both grunting)

186
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,133
            - Whoa!
            - Ugh!

187
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,071
  I need to get moving. Do you
  know where I can find tools?

188
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,407
            - Brrr!
      - Nice to meet you.

189
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,576
             Aargh!

190
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,044
        She seems nice.

191
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:19,417
   Allow me. You sit back and
relax while Sonic saves the day.

192
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,620
  OK, I'll just wash my scarf.

193
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,623
Please, the honour is all mine.

194
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,558
          Well, then,
     I'll just rest my arm.

195
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,661
     All right, all right!
  I'll get you a heating pad.

196
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,196
   Talk about a drama queen.

197
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,632
    Would you like a pillow?

198
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,967
  No! I'll get Perci a pillow.

199
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,703
       Oh, now the princess
         wants a pillow.

200
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,640
         (All grunting)

201
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,477
        (Tails) Hold it!

202
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,646
    How did you get in here
      in the first place?

203
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,414
       We just walked in.

204
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,517
     And there weren't lasers
 or cages or anything like that?

205
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,453
    Nope. Just a popping sound
   and some electrical buzzing.

206
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,455
 (Sighs) I know what happened.

207
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,991
     My new defence system
   must have short-circuited,

208
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,161
    which means I'm the one
   responsible for the fire.

209
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:06,231
          Classic Tails.
        So irresponsible.

210
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,933
  - Guess we're off the hook!
  - Who's up for Meh Burger?

211
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,573
   I like a guy who's handy.

211
00:11:16,305 --> 00:11:22,203
