    TO BE HARD ON THE GIRL.

         LET US NOT BE          
      POOR IN SPIRIT, TOO.      

73
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,220
          JESUS SAID,           

74
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:51,423
    "ASK AND IT SHALL           
         BE GIVEN YOU.          

75
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,925
"SEEK AND YOU SHALL FIND.       

76
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:57,762

    OPENED UNTO YOU."           

77
00:04:57,763 --> 00:05:00,431
     BUT YOU DID NOT KNOCK.     

78
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:02,466
        AND ANOTHER TIME        
         OUR LORD SAID,         

79
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:06,771
        WHAT DOST THINK         
    OF THY RIVAL, REVEREND?

YOUNG CREATURE.                 

81
00:05:09,441 --> 00:05:12,343
BUT SURELY NATURE               
NEVER INTENDED HER              
TO BE A PREACHER.               

82
00:05:12,344 --> 00:05:14,679
            SINNERS!

    AH, DEAR FRIENDS,           

84
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,416
         DOES THAT MEAN         
          YOU AND ME?           

85
00:05:19,885 --> 00:05:21,586
        IF THERE IS ANY         
     AMONG YOU WHOSE MIND--

     WHOSE LIFE IS UNHOLY,

00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,026
AY, A PREACHER!                 

90
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,795
    REMEMBER SOME DAY           
YOU MUST STAND BEFORE GOD       

91
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:32,696
    DRESSED IN NOTHING          
         BUT YOUR SINS,         

92
00:05:32,697 --> 00:05:33,697
...MORE THAN A PROPHETESS.      
                    FATHER!

112
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:15,639
    I KNOW YOU THINK            
    A HUSBAND WOULD BE TAKING   

113
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,575
          TOO MUCH              
          OF YOUR THOUGHTS.     

114
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:21,879
          MAYBE YOU'LL THINK ME 
          OVER BOLD TO SPEAK    
          ABOUT IT AGAIN.       

115
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,148
              BUT IT SEEMS TO ME
              THERE'S MORE TEXTS
              FOR MARRYING      

116
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:26,183
              THAN EVER YOU'LL  
              FIND AGAINST.     

117
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,655
I THANK YOU, SETH,              

118
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:33,224
FOR YOUR LOVE TOWARD ME.        

119
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:35,360
BUT MY HEART'S                  
NOT FREE TO MARRY.              

120
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:40,465
I WANT TO LIVE AND DIE          
WITHOUT HUSBAND OR CHILDREN.    

121
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:43,000
 IT'S AS IF GOD LEFT            
 NO ROOM IN ME SOUL             

122
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:44,669
FOR WANTS                       
AND FEARS OF ME OWN.            

123
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,640
    ( birds singing )           

124
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,579
        ( sawing )              
    ( goats bleating )          

125
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,433
         ( hammering )          

126
00:07:16,434 --> 00:07:18,603
THAT'S NEVER FATHER             
WORKING SO LATE.                

127
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,973
         NAY. IT'S THEE BROTHER,

128
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,941
             AS DOES EVERYTHING.

129
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:34,918
         YOU'RE LATE BACK.      

130
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,687
I SAW DINAH HOME                
AFTER PREACHING.                

131
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:42,192
SHE'S GOING BACK                
TO SNOWFIELD ON SUNDAY.         

132
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:46,797
      YOU'RE WASTING            
      YOUR TIME THERE, I RECKON.

133
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,235
             SHE'S NOT          
             MY IDEA OF A WOMAN.

134
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:53,504
    SHE'D A DEAL BETTER         
    BE STOPPING WITH HER OWN KIN

135
00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:56,274
            THAN GOING PREACHING
            AMONG STRANGERS.    

136
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:59,343
        THERE'S SUCH A THING    
        AS BEING OVER-SPIRITUAL,

137
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:00,678
         ESPECIALLY IN A WOMAN. 

138
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:02,212
WELL, ADDY.                     

139
00:08:02,213 --> 00:08:04,815
 WE CANNOT LOVE                 
 WHERE OTHER FOLKS              
 WOULD HAVE US.                 

140
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:08,286
YOU MAY AS WELL                 
TRY TO TURN A WAGON             
IN A NARROW LANE.               

141
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,754
LET ME TAKE                     
MY TURN NOW.                    

142
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,489
             AYE, COME AND HAVE 
             THEE SUPPER, ADAM. 

143
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,523
                    COME.       

144
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:13,658
          LET BE!               

145
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,861
      ME THROAT'S TOO FULL      
      TO SWALLOW SUPPER.        

146
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:19,897
FINE CHANCE I'VE GOT            
OF MAKING A LIFE OF MESELF      

147
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:22,433
WITH FATHER,                    
A MILLSTONE ROUND ME NECK.      

148
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:24,402
THERE'S LITTLE ENOUGH WORK      
WITHOUT FATHER NOT TROUBLING    

149
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,036
TO GET IT DONE ON TIME.         

150
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:28,673
     YOU'RE ALWAYS TOO HARD     
     ON THEE FATHER, ADAM.      

151
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,874
        THAT'S BETTER THAN BEING
        TOO SOFT, I RECKON.     

152
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,644
 HASN'T THY FATHER              
 TAUGHT THEE ALL THE TRADE?     

153
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:34,812
    AND HE'S NEVER              
    GIVEN ME A BLOW             

154
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:37,615
        NOR AS MUCH             
        AS AN ILL WORD.         

155
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:41,552
     IT ISN'T THEE FATHER       
     THAT HOLDS THEE BACK, ADAM.

156
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:45,289
     TO THINK AS HE COULD HAVE  
     MASTER BURGE'S DAUGHTER    

157
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,990
     AND BE TOOK PARTNERS       
     IN THE BUSINESS            

158
00:08:46,991 --> 00:08:48,892
     IF HE HADN'T SET HIS HEART 
     FOR THAT BIT OF A WENCH--  

159
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:50,260
                     MOTHER!    

160
00:08:50,261 --> 00:08:52,596
     NO MORE USE                
     NOR THE GILLYFLOWER        
     ON THE WALL--              

161
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:54,699
         LEAVE ME ALONE, MOTHER!
         TAKE HER OUT, SETH!    

162
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,733
         AND LET ME             
         GET ON WITH THE WORK.  

163
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:56,734
COME ON, MOTHER.                

164
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,975
        ( sawing )              

165
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:13,284
         ( coughs )             
         "DON'T BE LATE, FATHER.

166
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:16,721
             DON'T DO THIS.     
             DON'T DO THAT."    

167
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,990
            ( coughs )          

168
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:21,926
      ( sawing continues )      

169
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:26,997
        ( barks )               

170
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:30,935
     ( barking continues )      

171
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,351
     ( barking continues )      

172
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,493
          ( barking )           
    ( water running )           

173
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:16,847
          ( barking )           

174
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,222
      Seth: WHAT'S THAT         
      STICKING AGAINST THE BANK?

175
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:47,778
                    DINAH!      

176
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:53,017
        TO THINK HE DIED        
        WITH ME ASLEEP IN ME BED

177
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:56,020
        AS IF I CARED           
        NAUGHT ABOUT IT.        

178
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:58,589
              AND HE WAS...     

179
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,192
            AS WERE             
            YOUNG FOLKS ONCE.   

180
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,528
                  OH, DINAH!    

181
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,299
                ( sobs )        

182
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,068
    ( birds chirping )          

183
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:12,069
        ( hen clucking )        

184
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:33,424
          ( humming )           

185
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:49,107
                GOOD EVENING,   
                ADAM BEDE.      

186
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,409
     I'M SORRY.                 

187
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,377
 I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU.           

188
00:11:57,816 --> 00:11:59,850
             I CAME TO BE OF USE
             TO YOUR MOTHER.    

189
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,231
MOTHER'S NOT OVER-FOND          
OF YOUNG WOMEN.                 

190
00:12:14,232 --> 00:12:15,866
I HOPE SHE'S                    
PROPERLY GRATEFUL.              

191
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:19,103
                    OH, YES.    

192
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:21,105
        SHE'S ASLEEP AT LAST.   

193
00:12:26,511 --> 00:12:28,345
        ( cows mooing )         

194
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:34,418
    ( horse neighing )          

195
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,528
         IF IT ISN'T            
         CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE    
         AND THE RECTOR         

196
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:45,830
         A'COMING INTO THE YARD.

197
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,131
        I'LL LAY ME LIFE        
        THEY'RE COME TO SPEAK   

198
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:48,532
        ABOUT THAT FOOL'S       
        TRICK OF YOURS          

199
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:50,001
        OF PREACHING            
        ON THE GREEN.           

200
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,035
            WELL, IT'S YOU      
            MUST ANSWER         

201
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,236
            FOR I'M DUMB.       

202
00:12:52,237 --> 00:12:53,304
            I'VE SAID ENOUGH    
            ABOUT YOU           

203
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,439
            BRINGING DISGRACE   
            ON THE POYSERS.     

204
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,209
    THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN        
    A DECENT GOD-FEARING FAMILY.

205
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:00,945
              FINE RIDE, ARTHUR.

206
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,213
MORNING, REVEREND.              

207
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,281
        THANK YOU, CRANNAGE.    

208
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,385
                     ( nickers )

209
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:12,155
              TO THINK          
              OF A NIECE OF MINE

210
00:13:12,156 --> 00:13:13,290
              BEING THE CAUSE   
              OF ME HUSBAND     

211
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,558
            BEING TURNED OUT    
            OF HIS FARM!        

212
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,426
NAY, AUNT ELLEN.                
YOU'VE NO CAUSE                 
FOR SUCH FEARS.                 

213
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:17,995
I DIDN'T PREACH                 
WITHOUT DIRECTION.              

214
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:19,129
                DIRECTION!      

215
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,431
                I KNOW VERY WELL
                WHAT YOU MEAN   
                BY DIRECTION.   

216
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:22,800
         WHEN YOU'VE GOT        
         A BIGGER MAGGOT        
         THAN USUAL IN YOUR HEAD

217
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,401
        YOU CALL IT "DIRECTION".

218
00:13:24,402 --> 00:13:26,503
      THERE'S NO MORE MOVING YOU
      THAN A ROOTED TREE.       

219
00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:28,005
             YOU MAY SAY

            AS FOR FARMING,

      THAT THE CHEESE MAY SWELL,

245
00:14:12,984 --> 00:14:14,618

        MAY SLIP THEIR CALVES.  

246
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:15,620

00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:19,523
TO PART WITH SUCH               
GOOD TENANTS AS YOU.

              WELL, NOW, SIR,

    TO GET US SOME NEW GATES    
    AND ROOFING FOR THE BARN,   

253
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:30,734

             TILL HE'S WORN OUT.

255
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:34,171
YOU, OF ALL PEOPLE,             
MRS. POYSER, SHOULD KNOW        

256
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:35,839
IT WOULD DO ONLY                
MORE HARM THAN GOOD             

257
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,109
 IF I SPOKE                     
 ABOUT THE GATES.               

258
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,911
BUT, IS YOUR HUSBAND ABOUT?     

259
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:42,713
                 OH, NO, SIR.

                 BEING AS THINGS
                 ALWAYS HAPPEN  
                 SO CONTRARY.   

261
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:46,249
I FANCIED A LOOK                
AT THE WHELPS                   

262
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,851

KEEPING FOR ME.                 

263
00:14:47,852 --> 00:14:49,586
BUT NEVER MIND.                 
ANOTHER TIME.                   

264

              BY THE BY,        

265
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:53,524
              I'VE NEVER        
              SEEN YOUR DAIRY.  

266
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,125
            I MUST SEE          
            YOUR DAIRY,         
            MRS. POYSER.        

267
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:56,159
 OH, INDEED, SIR.               

268
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,461
IT'S NOT FIT                    
FOR YOU TO GO IN                

269
00:14:57,462 --> 00:14:59,630
FOR HETTY'S IN THE MIDDLE       
OF MAKING THE BUTTER.

            I'M SURE IT'S       
            IN CAPITAL ORDER.   

271

272
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:10,974
          A VISITOR             
          IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.  

273
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:12,576
YES, SIR.

276
00:15:16,014 --> 00:15:17,514
        OH, I WAS THERE ONCE.   

277
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:19,516
        A BLEAK AND DREARY      
        PLACE, IS IT NOT?       

278
00:15:19,517 --> 00:15:20,985
                ( laughs )      

279
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:24,521
              I SEEM TO REMEMBER
              THEY WERE BUILDING
              A COTTON MILL.    

280
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:26,623
I WORK IN IT MESELF.            

281
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:29,226
WE'VE BUILT                     
A CHAPEL THERE TOO.             

282
00:15:29,227 --> 00:15:30,494
              AND LAST NIGHT    
              YOU PREACHED      

283

284
00:15:32,897 --> 00:15:34,231
    I DID.                      

285
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,970
    YOUR SOCIETY SANCTIONS      
    WOMEN PREACHING?            

286
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:43,940

            FORBID THEM, SIR,   

287
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:46,243
            WHEN THEY'VE        
            A CLEAR CALL.       

288
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:49,212
    THE SHORTHORNS WAS BOUGHT   
    ON AN EXPERIMENT, SIR.      

289
00:15:49,213 --> 00:15:51,048
    AND THE SOONER              
    WE GET RID OF THEM,         
    THE BETTER.                 

290
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:52,482
    FOR THERE'S                 
    THAT LITTLE YELLOW COW      

291
00:15:52,483 --> 00:15:53,817
    AS DOESN'T GIVE             
    HALF THE MILK,              

292
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:56,386
    BUT I'VE TWICE AS MUCH      
    BUTTER FROM HER.            

293
00:15:56,387 --> 00:15:58,622
    AND THEN, WHAT CREAM        
    THE SHORTHORNS GIVE!        

294
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:00,591
    I DECLARE TOTTY             
    EATS THE HALF OF IT.        

295
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,059
        ( laughs )              

296
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,895
BUT WHERE IS TOTTY?             
I WANT TO SEE HER.              

297
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:06,764
         OH, WHERE'S            
         THE LITTLE'UN, HETTY?

             INTO THE BREW HOUSE

299
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:09,600
             TO NANCY, I THINK. 
      OH.                       

300
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:13,070
        ( cock crowing )        

301
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:17,975
AND...                          

302
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:20,744
DO YOU TAKE THE BUTTER          
TO MARKET WHEN YOU'VE MADE IT?  

303
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:22,713
                  OH, NO, SIR.  

304
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:24,514
                  NOT WHEN IT'S 
                  SO HEAVY.     

305
00:16:24,515 --> 00:16:26,750
                  ALICK TAKES IT
                  ON HORSEBACK. 

306
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:29,086
BUT YOU GO OUT                  
TO WALK SOMETIMES               

307
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:30,587
ON THESE PLEASANT EVENINGS,     
DON'T YOU?                      

308
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,924
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE              
A WALK IN THE CHASE             

309
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:37,028
NOW THAT IT'S                   
SO GREEN AND PLEASANT?

OR AT CHURCH.                   

312
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:44,068
                WELL, ME AUNT

                TO GO A-WALKING,

             THE LADY'S MAID,   
             THAT I GO TO SEE.

322
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,522
WILL YOU STAY LONG?             

323
00:17:08,326 --> 00:17:11,495
              NOT LATER         
              THAN SEVEN, SIR,  

324
00:17:11,496 --> 00:17:14,031
              FOR I MUST BE HOME
              BY EIGHT.         

325
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:15,966
         ( Mrs. Poyser          
      and Totty giggling )      

326
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:16,934
AND HERE SHE IS.                

327
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,937
            HERE'S TOTTY!       

328
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,072
                     OH!        

329
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,107
         HAS SHE GOT A POCKET   
         ON TODAY, I WONDER.    

330
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,209
IT'S GOT NOTHING IN IT.         

331
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,278
                NO?             
                WHAT A PITY!    

332
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,746
          WELL, I THINK I'VE GOT
          SOMETHING IN MINE.    

333
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:31,582
     ( coins jingle )           
                          YES!  

334
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,883
                I DECLARE       

335
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:36,987
    I'VE GOT                    
    FIVE LITTLE ROUND THINGS.   

336
00:17:36,988 --> 00:17:38,455
          AND HEAR              
          WHAT A PRETTY NOISE   

337
00:17:38,456 --> 00:17:40,190
        THEY MAKE IN TOTTY'S    

338
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:41,325
                    PINK...     

339
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,326
                      POCKET.   

340
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:49,433
COME TO ME,                     
MY PET, MY DILLING.             

341
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:51,835
  NOW THANK                     
  THE CAPTAIN, TOTTY.           

342
00:17:51,836 --> 00:17:54,037
FOR SHAME,                      
YOU'RE SPOILED AWFUL.           

343
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:55,673
( laughs )                      

344
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:02,246
                 YOU CAN USE    
                 YOUR RIGHT ARM 

345
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,248
                 QUITE WELL NOW,
                 ARTHUR?        

346
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,951
YES, PRETTY WELL.               

347
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,653
BUT GODWIN STILL INSISTS        
ON MY KEEPING IT UP.            

348
00:18:09,654 --> 00:18:11,388
I HOPE TO GOD                   
IT'S NOT TOO LONG               

349
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:13,223
BEFORE I CAN REJOIN             
THE REGIMENT.                   

350
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:14,959
IT'S A BIT DULL                 
BEING SHUT UP AT THE CHASE      

351
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,127
WHEN THERE'S NEITHER            
HUNTING NOR SHOOTING TO BE HAD. 

352
00:18:17,128 --> 00:18:18,996
            SHUT UP, YOU SAY?   

353
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,065
         AND WHAT DID YOU FIND  
         SO FASCINATING         

354
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,934
         IN MRS. POYSER'S DAIRY?

355
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:26,203
I WENT TO LOOK                  
AT THE PRETTY BUTTER-MAKER.     

356
00:18:26,204 --> 00:18:27,338
HETTY SORREL.                   

357
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,873
                      AH.       

358
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:32,409
            AS AN OLD FELLOW    
            TO WHOM WISDOM      
            HAS BECOME CHEAP,   

359
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,245
            MAY I SUGGEST       
            YOU DON'T LOOK      

360
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,513
            ON HETTY SORREL     
            TOO MUCH?           

361
00:18:37,515 --> 00:18:38,815
          WHEN I MAKE UP MY MIND

362
00:18:38,816 --> 00:18:40,951
          THAT I CAN'T AFFORD   
          A TEMPTING DOG,       

363
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:44,488
          I--TAKE               
          NO NOTICE OF HIM.     

364
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:47,090
        BECAUSE IF HE BECAME    
        OVER-FOND OF ME,        

365
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:48,392
        OR LOOKED LOVINGLY,     

366
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,726
        THEN THE TEMPTATION     

367
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:53,030
        BETWEEN INCLINATION     
        AND POCKET              

368
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:56,167
        WOULD BECOME            
        UNBEARABLY DIFFICULT.   

369
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,336
I'LL BEAR IT IN MIND.           
SHALL WE CANTER?                

370
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,641
    ( goats bleating )          

371
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,580
    ( birds chirping )          

372
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:23,026
      ( bells tolling )         

373
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:29,666
        I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.   

374
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,000
             I NEED TO GET AWAY.

375
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:34,003
     I SHALL GO TO EAGLEDALE    
     AND FISH FOR A WEEK OR TWO.

376
00:19:34,004 --> 00:19:36,873
            BE READY BY         
            HALF PAST ELEVEN.   
            THANK YOU, PYM.     

377
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:38,274
        YES, SIR.               

378
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:41,345
    THE FRESH AIR WILL DO YOU   
    A POWER OF GOOD, SIR.       

379
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,687
COME TO THINK OF IT,            

380
00:19:50,688 --> 00:19:53,256
DAMNED AWKWARD                  
FISHING WITH ONE ARM.           

381
00:19:53,257 --> 00:19:55,124
             I SHALL HAVE       
             TO MAKE DO HERE.   

382
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,660
             RIDING-COAT.       

383
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:57,694
  YES, SIR.                     

384
00:20:01,432 --> 00:20:02,565
            ( nickers )         

385
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:18,849
GOOD BOY, RATTLER.              

386
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:34,598
Arthur: HA!                     

387
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:43,840
 AH, RATTLER!                   

388
00:20:43,841 --> 00:20:45,309
COME ON!                        

389
00:20:52,516 --> 00:20:53,717
    ( birds tweeting )          

390
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:55,619
         ( chattering )         

391
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,058
ADAM BEDE!                      

392
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,159
  ( laughs )                    

393
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,261
I CAN SWEAR                     
TO THAT BACK A MILE OFF.        

394
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:05,629
 IT'S THE SAME,                 
 ONLY BROADER                   

395
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,765
AS WHEN YOU USED                
TO CARRY ME ON IT, REMEMBER?    

396
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,033
        IT'D BE A POOR LOOKOUT  
        IF FOLKS DIDN'T REMEMBER

397
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:12,202
          WHAT THEY DID AND SAID
          WHEN THEY WERE LADS.  

398
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:17,174
SORRY TO HEAR                   
ABOUT YOUR FATHER, ADAM.        

399
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:20,277
    FATHER WAS                  
    NOTHING MUCH MORE           
    THAN A BURDEN TO ME, SIR.   

400
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:21,411
          SETH AND ME'LL HOPE   

401
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:23,580
          TO BUILD UP           
          A DECENT BUSINESS NOW.

402
00:21:23,581 --> 00:21:25,916
WELL, YOU'VE CERTAINLY HAD      
YOUR SHARE OF TROUBLES.         

403
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:28,551
          NOT MUCH CHANCE       
          TO BE LIGHT-HEARTED   

404
00:21:28,552 --> 00:21:29,787
          LIKE OTHER FELLOWS.   

405
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:35,392
PERHAPS IT'S MADE               
A BETTER MAN OF YOU.            

406
00:21:35,393 --> 00:21:38,328
 I-I MEAN TO SAY...             

407
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:40,630
I DON'T IMAGINE                 
YOU'D HAVE MUCH DIFFICULTY      

408
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:42,399
MASTERING A WISH.               

409
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,102
ONCE YOU'D MADE UP YOUR MIND    
IT WAS WRONG TO INDULGE.        

410
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,636
WOULD YOU?                      

411
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:48,438
                NO.             

412
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:50,540
            MY FAULT            
            LIES T'OTHER WAY.   

413
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,376
        WHEN I'VE SET           
        ME MIND ON SOMETHING,   

414
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,611
        EVEN IF                 
        IT'S ONLY TO MESELF,    

415
00:21:54,612 --> 00:21:56,646
        IT'S HARD               
        FOR ME TO GO BACK.      

416
00:21:56,647 --> 00:21:58,047
    ( horse nickers )           

417
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,385
        RATTLER'S               
        IN A BIT OF A LATHER.   

418
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,121
     YES.                       

419
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:07,491
I'VE BEEN PUTTING HIM           
THROUGH HIS PACES.              

420
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,460
  TO BE FRANK,                  

421
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,428
RATTLER AND I                   
ARE BORED TO DEATH              

422
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:13,196
WITH NOTHING TO DO.             

423
00:22:13,197 --> 00:22:15,399
        LIFE'S CONTRARY, SIR.   

424
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,133
        FOR WHERE THERE'S       
        SOME HAVE NOTHING,      

425
00:22:17,134 --> 00:22:18,968
        OTHERS HAVE TOO MUCH.   

426
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:23,973
                WELL, SIR.      

427
00:22:23,974 --> 00:22:26,510
        THIS IS WHERE           
        I MUST BID YOU GOOD-BYE.

428
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:28,812
  GOOD-BYE, ADAM.               

429
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,781
                BYE, SIR.

432
00:22:36,387 --> 00:22:37,887
BYE.                            

433
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:42,626
     WEATHER'S HOLDING UP WELL  
     FOR THE HARVEST, SIR.      

434
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,864
YES, JOSHUA.                    

435
00:22:47,865 --> 00:22:49,366
  YES, IT IS INDEED.            

436
00:23:07,384 --> 00:23:09,052
    ( women laughing )          

437
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:28,805
          ( no audio )          

438
00:24:18,222 --> 00:24:19,923
    ( birds chirping )          

439
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,716
YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT              

440
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:50,153
TO CHOOSE THIS WAY              
OF COMING THROUGH THE CHASE.    

441
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:51,521
IT'S SO MUCH PRETTIER.          

442
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,091
BUT IT'S SHORTER                
THAN COMING                     

443
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,293
BY EITHER OF THE LODGES.        

444
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,327
                YES, SIR.       

445
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:00,464
BUT AREN'T YOU AFRAID           

446
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:04,001
TO COME SO LONELY A ROAD        
IN THE EVENING?                 

447
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,169
                  IT'S NEVER    
                  TOO LATE, SIR.

448
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,504
          ME AUNT WOULD BE ANGRY

449
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:09,706
          IF I DIDN'T GET HOME  
          BEFORE EIGHT.         

450
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:12,876
THEN I MUSTN'T KEEP YOU,        

451
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:14,344
OR ELSE,                        
I SHOULD HAVE LIKED             

452
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:16,746
TO SHOW YOU                     
THE HERMITAGE.                  

453
00:25:16,747 --> 00:25:18,681
DID YOU EVER SEE IT?            

454
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:21,918
                    NO, SIR.    

455
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,721
THIS IS THE WALK                
WHERE WE TURN UP TO IT.         

456
00:25:26,724 --> 00:25:29,226
BUT WE MUSTN'T GO NOW.          

457
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:31,428
I'LL SHOW IT TO YOU             
SOME OTHER TIME.                

458
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:32,795
WOULD YOU LIKE                  
TO SEE IT?                      

459
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,766
            YES, PLEASE, SIR.   

460
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:40,137
BUT PERHAPS                     
THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE            

461
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:42,872
WHO COMES TO MEET YOU           
ON YOUR WALKS?                  

462
00:25:42,873 --> 00:25:45,308
                NO, SIR.        

463
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:47,310
WHAT,                           
NO SUITORS, HETTY?              

464
00:25:47,311 --> 00:25:49,979
A PRETTY GIRL LIKE YOU?         

465
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,748
            THERE'S NO ONE      
            I LIKE, SIR.        

466
00:25:51,749 --> 00:25:54,952
NOT EVEN CRAIG,                 
THE GARDENER?                   

467
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:58,354
DOES HE NOT                     
SOMETIMES SEE YOU HOME?         

468
00:25:58,355 --> 00:26:00,324
            I'M SURE HE DOESN'T!

469
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,259
          I'M SURE HE NEVER DID.

470
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,561
          I--I WOULDN'T LET HIM.
          I DON'T LIKE HIM.     

471
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:07,664
I DIDN'T MEAN                   
TO UPSET YOU, HETTY.            

472
00:26:07,665 --> 00:26:10,400
 I WOULDN'T UPSET YOU           
 FOR THE WORLD.                 

473
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:12,903
COME, LOOK AT ME.               

474
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,371
ELSE, I'LL THINK                
YOU WON'T FORGIVE ME.           

475
00:26:30,688 --> 00:26:33,923
WE MUST WALK ON.                

476
00:26:33,924 --> 00:26:35,659
ELSE, YOU'LL BE LATE HOME.      

477
00:27:03,854 --> 00:27:04,887
  AH, HETTY.                    

478
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,260
I THINK WE MUSTN'T              
MEET AGAIN LIKE THIS.           

479
00:27:40,524 --> 00:27:42,458
          ( thumping )          

480
00:28:27,337 --> 00:28:30,272
"FOR I KNOW THIS,               

481
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:33,009
"AFTER MY DEPARTING             
SHALL GRIEVOUS WOLVES

 "ENTER IN AMONG YOU,           

483
00:28:35,746 --> 00:28:37,847
"NOT SPARING THE FLOCK."        

484
00:28:47,424 --> 00:28:48,792
          ( knocking )          

485
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,406
    I KNEW YOU WEREN'T ASLEEP   

486
00:29:03,407 --> 00:29:05,208
    BECAUSE I HEARD YOU         
    MOVING AROUND.              

487
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:21,491
        HOW I'M GOING TO MISS   
        YOU AND THE FARM.       

488
00:29:21,492 --> 00:29:23,326
            HOW I SHALL         
            REMEMBER YOU ALL.   

489
00:29:28,298 --> 00:29:30,433
              YOU MUSTN'T MIND  
              AUNT ELLEN, HETTY.

490
00:29:30,434 --> 00:29:31,734
        SHE ONLY                
        GETS CROSSED WITH YOU   

491
00:29:31,735 --> 00:29:33,269
        BECAUSE                 
        SHE CARES FOR YOU.      

492
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,904
  DOES SHE?                     

493
00:29:34,905 --> 00:29:37,474
I WAS ONLY                      
A FEW MINUTES LATE.             

494
00:29:39,376 --> 00:29:41,711
            I WANTED TO SAY     
            BEFORE I GO--       

495
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:49,152
  IF EVER YOU NEED              
  A FRIEND, HETTY,              

496
00:29:49,153 --> 00:29:52,155
IF EVER YOU'RE                  
IN TROUBLE...                   

497
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:54,858
REMEMBER ME.                    

498
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:58,461
          WHY SHOULD YOU THINK  
          AS I'LL BE IN TROUBLE?

499
00:29:58,462 --> 00:30:00,730
BECAUSE THERE'S NONE OF US      
CAN GET THROUGH THIS LIFE       

500
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:03,867
WITHOUT SOME SORT               
OF TROUBLE.                     

501
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:06,803
AND THERE'S SOME FOLKS          
AS IS FAIR WEATHER FRIENDS.     

502
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:09,839
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW          

503
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,275
I WON'T FAIL YOU                
ON THE EVIL DAY.                

504
00:30:12,276 --> 00:30:15,812
        OH, DO NOT TALK TO ME   
        LIKE THAT, DINAH!       

505
00:30:17,915 --> 00:30:19,449
I'VE NEVER DONE                 
ANYTHING TO YOU.                

506
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,618
WHY CAN'T YOU LET ME BE?        

507
00:30:28,358 --> 00:30:29,626
            GOOD NIGHT, HETTY.  

508
00:30:31,495 --> 00:30:32,629
             I'LL LEAVE YOU NOW.

509
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,638
         BUT I'LL NEVER FORGET  
         WHAT I SAID THIS NIGHT.

510
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:47,944
        ( door closes )         

511
00:31:21,578 --> 00:31:22,678
          ( knocking )          

512
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:24,480
          Arthur: GODSON ARTHUR.
          MAY HE COME IN?       

513
00:31:24,481 --> 00:31:26,816
MY DEAR BOY,                    
OF COURSE.                      

514
00:31:26,817 --> 00:31:28,451
COME IN.                        

515
00:31:28,452 --> 00:31:30,753
WELL, THIS IS QUITE             
LIKE THE OLD DAYS.              

516
00:31:30,754 --> 00:31:32,055
        ( dog whining )         

517
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:35,024
IT MUST BE YEARS                
SINCE WE HAD BREAKFAST TOGETHER.

518
00:31:35,025 --> 00:31:36,893
DID YOU SEE CARSTAIRS?          
                          I DID.

519
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:38,294
GOOD. SIT DOWN.                 

520
00:31:38,295 --> 00:31:40,496
            I'VE BEEN OUT RIDING
            OVER THE ESTATE.    

521
00:31:40,497 --> 00:31:41,865
          NOTHING               
          I LOOK FORWARD TO MORE

522
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:44,133
            THAN SETTING        
            IMPROVEMENT ON FOOT.

523
00:31:44,134 --> 00:31:46,102
        THE PLACE HAS BEEN      
        SHAMEFULLY NEGLECTED    

524
00:31:46,103 --> 00:31:47,770
                 AND THE MEN.   

525
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:50,106
        I WANT TO KNOW          
        EVERY LABORER BY NAME   

526
00:31:50,107 --> 00:31:52,608
          AND SEE THEM          
          TOUCH THEIR HATS TO ME
          WITH A FRIENDLY LOOK. 

527
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:54,344
WELL SAID.                      
VERY WELL SAID.                 

528
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:55,578
THANK YOU.                      

529
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:57,881
BUT YOU KNOW,                   
YOU MUST BE, UH,                

530
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:01,717
QUITE CLEAR                     
IN YOUR CHOICE OF YOUR BENT.    

531
00:32:01,718 --> 00:32:04,820
WHETHER IT BE                   
POPULARITY OR USEFULNESS.       

532
00:32:04,821 --> 00:32:07,257
OTHERWISE, YOU MAY HAPPEN       
TO LOSE BOTH.                   

533
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,025
        I'M NOT SURE I AGREE.   

534
00:32:10,026 --> 00:32:12,027
        BESIDES, I COULDN'T     
        LIVE IN A PLACE         

535
00:32:12,028 --> 00:32:13,996
        WHERE I WASN'T          
        RESPECTED AND LIKED.    

536
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,099
YOU KNOW,                       
MY MOTHER AND I                 

537
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,669
OFTEN HAVE                      
A LITTLE DISCUSSION             
ABOUT YOU, ARTHUR.              

538
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,804
SHE SAYS,                       
"I WILL NOT WASTE               

539
00:32:21,805 --> 00:32:26,542
"A SINGLE PROPHECY              
ON MY FAVORITE GODSON           

540
00:32:26,543 --> 00:32:29,645
UNTIL I SEE THE WOMAN           
HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH."         

541
00:32:29,646 --> 00:32:31,214
YOU SEE,                        
SHE IS OF THE OPINION           

542
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:34,184
THAT YOUR LADY-LOVE             
WILL RULE YOU                   

543
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:37,287
AS THE MOON                     
RULES THE TIDES.                

544
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,789
BUT I DON'T                     
AGREE WITH HER.                 

545
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,892
I DON'T THINK YOU ARE           
OF THAT WATERY NATURE.          

546
00:32:42,893 --> 00:32:45,928
SO YOU BE CAREFUL YOU DON'T     
DISGRACE MY JUDGMENT.           

547
00:32:48,431 --> 00:32:50,133
         BUT SURELY             
         IT'S NOT AN ARGUMENT   

548
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,901
         AGAINST A MAN'S GENERAL
         STRENGTH OF CHARACTER  

549
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:54,837
         THAT HE SHOULD BE      
         MASTERED BY LOVE?      

550
00:32:54,838 --> 00:32:57,507
         A GOOD CONSTITUTION    
         DOESN'T INSURE ONE     
         AGAINST SMALLPOX.      

551
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:03,179
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE           
BETWEEN LOVE AND SMALLPOX.      

552
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,914
( chuckles )                    

553
00:33:04,915 --> 00:33:08,017
DETECT THE DISEASE              
AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE,           

554
00:33:08,018 --> 00:33:09,085
TRY A CHANGE OF AIR,            

555
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:11,287
AND YOU'VE                      
EVERY CHANCE OF ESCAPE.         

556
00:33:12,556 --> 00:33:14,123
        YES, BUT WHERE LOVE     
        IS CONCERNED,           

557
00:33:14,124 --> 00:33:15,624
        NEVER MIND              
        OUR GOOD RESOLUTIONS,   

558
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:17,927
         WE'RE RULED BY IMPULSE.

559
00:33:17,928 --> 00:33:21,831
        I DON'T THINK A MAN     
        SHOULD BE BLAMED SO MUCH
        IF HE'S...              

560
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:24,500
        BETRAYED BY A MOOD.     

561
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:27,770
A MAN'S MOOD                    
LIES IN HIS NATURE.             

562
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:30,573
AS DOES HIS RESOLUTION.         

563
00:33:30,574 --> 00:33:32,541
A MAN CANNOT DO ANYTHING        

564
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:34,610
AT ODDS                         
WITH HIS OWN NATURE.            

565
00:33:37,147 --> 00:33:39,348
        YES, BUT SURELY         
        THE MAN WHO STRUGGLES   
        AGAINST TEMPTATION      

566
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:41,617
     IS BETTER THAN THE MAN     
     WHO NEVER STRUGGLES AT ALL!

567
00:33:41,618 --> 00:33:44,486
I TAKE YOUR POINT.              

568
00:33:44,487 --> 00:33:46,455
BUT IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS,      

569
00:33:46,456 --> 00:33:48,858
IT'S WHAT WE DO                 
THAT MATTERS.                   

570
00:33:52,162 --> 00:33:54,664
AND WHAT WE DO IS JUDGED        
BY THE CONSEQUENCES             

571
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:57,166
RATHER THAN                     
OUR LAME EXCUSES.               

572
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:59,235
BUT I NEVER KNEW YOU            
SO INCLINED                     

573
00:33:59,236 --> 00:34:02,438
TO MORAL DISCUSSION,            
ARTHUR.                         

574
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:06,242
IS IT SOME DANGER OF YOUR OWN   
WE ARE CONSIDERING?             

575
00:34:06,243 --> 00:34:08,844
            LORD, NO!           
            ( chuckles )        

576
00:34:09,913 --> 00:34:11,147
            NO DANGER.          

577
00:34:11,148 --> 00:34:12,982
             NO I DON'T THINK   
             I'M ANY MORE LIABLE

578
00:34:12,983 --> 00:34:15,017
             TO IRRESOLUTION    
             THAN THE NEXT MAN. 

579
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:20,255
      BESIDES, I'VE FAR TOO FINE
      AN OPINION OF MYSELF      

580
00:34:20,256 --> 00:34:21,657
      TO RISK                   
      PLAYING THE VILLAIN.      

581
00:34:21,658 --> 00:34:24,627
( laughs )                      

582
00:34:24,628 --> 00:34:26,261
MORE WATER.                     

583
00:34:26,262 --> 00:34:28,430
    ( crows croaking )          

584
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,441
                COME ON, MAN,   
                COME ON.        

585
00:34:39,442 --> 00:34:42,078
                IS IT "YES"     
                OR IS IT "NO"?  

586
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,712
                I'VE MADE YOU   
                A SPLENDID OFFER

587
00:34:43,713 --> 00:34:45,948
            AND THE CAT'S GOT   
            YOUR TONGUE.        

588
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:48,617
THE ANSWER'S AYE, SIR,          
MAKE NO MISTAKE.                

589
00:34:48,618 --> 00:34:50,319
AND THANK YOU KINDLY.           

590
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,155
            DON'T THANK ME.     

591
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,656
            THANK ARTHUR.       

592
00:34:53,657 --> 00:34:56,392
            HE WORE ME DOWN...  

593
00:34:56,393 --> 00:34:58,928
             AGAINST            
             ME BETTER JUDGMENT.

594
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:01,264
        I WANTED AN OLDER MAN   

595
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,632
        TO TAKE STEWARDSHIP     
        OF THE WOODS.           

596
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,136
        STILL...                

597
00:35:07,137 --> 00:35:09,672
        HE TELLS ME             
        YOU'RE A GOOD CHAP,     

598
00:35:09,673 --> 00:35:12,842
        SO I TRUST              
        THE DAY WILL COME       

599
00:35:12,843 --> 00:35:14,543
          WHEN I WILL THANK YOU.

600
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,614
    I WANT THE JOB WELL DONE.   

601
00:35:18,615 --> 00:35:22,685
    YOU'LL OWE ME NO FAVORS,    
    I ASSURE YOU.               

602
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,301
I'D QUITE GIVEN UP              
ARGUING THE MATTER WITH HIM.    

603
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,136
THAT I SUGGEST A THING          
IS USUALLY REASON ENOUGH        

604
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:41,704
FOR THE OLD DEVIL               
TO REJECT IT.                   

605
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:43,038
THEN YESTERDAY,                 
HE CALLED ME IN                 

606
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:44,740
AND SAID                        
HE'D CHANGED HIS MIND.          

607
00:35:44,741 --> 00:35:46,208
FROM HERE TO THE COMMON         

608
00:35:46,209 --> 00:35:48,111
AND THE WOODS WILL BE           
IN YOUR SOLE CHARGE.            

609
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,779
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO        
THE SORRY STATE THEY'RE IN.     

610
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,549
DEAR GOD, THE MANAGEMENT        
OF THIS PLACE DISGUSTS ME.      

611
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,850
BUT NOW, AT LEAST...            

612
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:56,452
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO PUT           
THE RIGHT MAN                   

613
00:35:56,453 --> 00:35:57,954
IN ONE OF THE KEY JOBS.         

614
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:00,156
        IT MEANS A LOT TO ME,   
        SIR.                    

615
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:01,290
            IT'S NOT            
            JUST THE MONEY,     

616
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:03,225
        THOUGH GOD KNOWS        
        THAT'S WELCOME.         

617
00:36:04,661 --> 00:36:08,630
    BUT, WELL, THERE'S NO MAN   
    I'D RATHER WORK FOR.        

618
00:36:08,631 --> 00:36:10,499
    I RECKON AS EVERYONE'S      
    HOPES FOR THE FUTURE        

619
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,401
    ARE PINNED ON YOU, SIR.     

620
00:36:12,402 --> 00:36:15,771
    ( birds chirping )          

621
00:36:50,273 --> 00:36:53,676
    ( birds chirping )          

622
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,486
    ( creaking )                

623
00:38:12,422 --> 00:38:14,624
      Lisbeth: WHAT'S THEE GOT  
      THY SUNDAY CLOTHES ON FOR?

624
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,993
I'M GOING UP                    
TO THE HALL FARM.               

625
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,661
          WHAT'S THEE GOT       
          THY BEST CLOTHES ON   

626
00:38:18,662 --> 00:38:20,596
         FOR TO GO TO HALL FARM?

627
00:38:20,597 --> 00:38:22,532
    IT'S POOR KEEPING COMPANY   
    WITH FOLKS AS DONNA         

628
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,867
    LIKE TO SEE THEE            
    IN THY WORKING JACKET.      

629
00:38:24,868 --> 00:38:27,803
THEE KNOWST VERY WELL WHY,      
MOTHER.                         

630
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:29,872
A MAN HAS OTHER FEELINGS        

631
00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:32,074
BESIDES WHAT HE OWES HIS MOTHER,

632
00:38:32,075 --> 00:38:33,576
AND THEE MUST MAKE UP THY MIND  

633
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,077
AS I'LL NOT GIVE WAY TO THEE    

634
00:38:35,078 --> 00:38:37,312
WHERE I'VE A RIGHT              
TO DO WHAT I LIKE.              

635
00:38:37,313 --> 00:38:41,083
EH, AND WHO LIKES TO SEE THEE   
IN THY BEST CLOTHES             

636
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:42,652
BETTER NOR THY MOTHER?          

637
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:06,275
             Hetty:             
   I MET WITH VIRGINS SEVEN   

638
00:39:06,276 --> 00:39:10,947
     AND ONE OF THEM           
        WAS MARY MILD          

639
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:14,283
     OUR LORD'S BEST MOTHER    
        IN HE--                

640
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:20,422
  THE ROSE, THE GENTLE ROSE   

641
00:39:20,423 --> 00:39:24,560
           THE FENNEL          
      IT GROWS SO STRONG       

642
00:39:24,561 --> 00:39:27,997
       AND MEND GOOD LORD      
        YOUR CHARITY--         

643
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:33,302
          ( humming )           

644
00:39:43,146 --> 00:39:44,980
        YOUR AUNT'S ASKING      
        FOR YOU, HETTY.         

645
00:39:44,981 --> 00:39:48,150
THERE'S NOT                     
MANY MORE TO GET.               

646
00:39:48,151 --> 00:39:50,085
    ( birds chirping )          

647
00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:08,905
THAT'LL DO.                     

648
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,673
AUNT WANTS ME                   
TO LEAVE SOME ON.               

649
00:40:27,056 --> 00:40:28,290
                        HERE.   

650
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:29,458
                 STICK THAT     
                 IN YOUR FROCK, 

651
00:40:29,459 --> 00:40:31,494
                 YOU CAN PUT IT 
                 IN WATER AFTER.

652
00:40:37,467 --> 00:40:39,268
            ( Adam chuckles )   

653
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:40,369
          THAT'S LIKE THE LADIES

654
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:42,271
              IN THE PICTURES   
              AT THE CHASE.     

655
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:43,405
              THEY'VE MOSTLY GOT
              FLOWERS           

656
00:40:43,406 --> 00:40:45,941
              OR FEATHERS       
              IN THEIR HAIR...  

657
00:40:45,942 --> 00:40:50,279
    BUT SOMEHOW I DO NOT LIKE   
    TO SEE 'EM.                 

658
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:54,483
        WHAT CAN A WOMAN HAVE   
        BETTER NOR HER OWN HAIR?

659
00:40:54,484 --> 00:40:56,986
        EVEN DINAH MORRIS       
        LOOKS NICE              

660
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:59,187
      FOR ALL SHE WEARS         
      SUCH A PLAIN CAP AND GOWN.

661
00:41:01,157 --> 00:41:05,060
      IT SEEMS TO ME            
      AS A WOMAN'S FACE         
      DOES NOT WANT FLOWERS.    

662
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,831
      IT'S ALMOST               
      LIKE A FLOWER ITSELF.     

663
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,101
        I'M SURE YOURS IS.      

664
00:41:16,773 --> 00:41:18,908
    ( violin playing )          

665
00:41:21,444 --> 00:41:23,913
Mrs. Poyser:                    
BE QUIET NOW, WILL YOU?         

666
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:26,181
ALICK, SHUT THY NOISE!          

667
00:41:28,384 --> 00:41:31,587
HERE, MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME     
WITH THE COLD POTATOES.         

668
00:41:31,588 --> 00:41:33,188
            CONGRATULATIONS,    
            ADAM.               

669
00:41:33,189 --> 00:41:35,057
            NO MAN COULD BE     
            HAPPIER THAN ME     

670
00:41:35,058 --> 00:41:37,426
             TO SEE THEE STEWARD
             OF THE WOODS.      

671
00:41:37,427 --> 00:41:38,293
UH-HUH.                         

672
00:41:39,495 --> 00:41:40,629
             Martin: THE CAPTAIN
             NEVER DID          

673
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,097
             A FAIRER THING     
             IN HIS LIFE.       

674
00:41:42,098 --> 00:41:43,265
             I SPEAK FOR US ALL 

675
00:41:43,266 --> 00:41:44,466
             WHEN I SAY         
             WE LOOK FORWARD    

676
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:46,302
         TO THE DAY             
         WHEN HE'S OUR LANDLORD.

677
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:49,505
AYE, AND GOOD RIDDANCE          
TO THE OLD SQUIRE               

678
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:52,508
WHO'S NAME'S NO BETTER          
THAN BRIMSTONE                  
IN EVERYONE'S NOSE.             

679
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:54,343
    TRUE ENOUGH,                
    THE OLD SQUIRE'S GOT NONE   

680
00:41:54,344 --> 00:41:56,545
    BUT THE DEVIL TO HIS FRIEND,

681
00:41:56,546 --> 00:41:59,148
      BUT I'VE KNOWN THE CAPTAIN
      SINCE HE WAS A LITTLE ONE,

682
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:00,382
      AND I'VE NEVER KNOWN      
      ANYTHING ON HIM           

683
00:42:00,383 --> 00:42:02,685
      BUT WAS                   
      GOOD AND HONORABLE.       

684
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,821
      HE'LL MAKE                
      NO MAN'S BREAD BITTER     
      IF HE CAN HELP IT.        

685
00:42:05,822 --> 00:42:06,989
Mrs. Poyser:                    
ADAM, WILL YOU TAKE             

686
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,591
SOME VINEGAR                    
WITH YOUR LETTUCE?              

687
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:09,926
AYE, YOU'RE                     
IN THE RIGHT NOT TO.            

688
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:12,728
IT SPOILS THE FLAVOR            
OF THE CHINE,                   
TO MY THINKING.                 

689
00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:15,031
IT'S A POOR EATING              
WHEN THE FLAVOR OF THE MEAT     

690
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,632
LIES IN THE CRUETS.             

691
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:18,601
THERE'S FOLK                    
AS MAKE BAD BUTTER              

692
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:20,636
AND TRUST TO THE SALT           
TO HIDE IT--                    
        ( gasps )               

693
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,511
DID EVER ANYBODY                
SEE THE LIKE?                   

694
00:42:29,512 --> 00:42:33,014
( Mrs. Poyser gasps )           

695
00:42:33,015 --> 00:42:34,483
THE JUG'S BEWITCHED.            

696
00:42:35,618 --> 00:42:36,952
HETTY...                        

697
00:42:36,953 --> 00:42:38,687
ARE YOU MAD?                    

698
00:42:38,688 --> 00:42:40,589
WHATEVER ARE YOU DOING          
COMING DOWN LIKE A GHOST?       

699
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:43,959
    Martin: WHY, HETTY LASS,    
    ARE YOU TURNED METHODIST?   

700
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,262
          ( laughing )          

701
00:42:47,263 --> 00:42:49,164
        YOU MUST PULL YOUR FACE 
        A DEAL LONGER           

702
00:42:49,165 --> 00:42:51,834
        AFORE YOU'LL DO FOR ONE,
        ISN'T THAT RIGHT, ADAM? 

703
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:52,901
              AYE.              

704
00:42:52,902 --> 00:42:56,038
    ( violin playing )          

705
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,724
I THOUGHT SHE WAS THE GHOST     
OF HER POOR DEAD MOTHER,        

706
00:43:15,725 --> 00:43:17,126
GOD REST HER SOUL.              

707
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:18,527
    ( Martin laughs )           

708
00:43:18,528 --> 00:43:22,365
            THEE LOOK'DST       
            AS SCARED AS SCARED!

709
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,600
IT LITTLE SIGNIFIES             
HOW I LOOKED.                   

710
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:26,802
LOOKS'LL MEND NO JUGS,          
I RECKON.                       

711
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:30,639
HOW COME YOU                    
TO PUT THEM THINGS ON, EH?      

712
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,075
          ADAM SAID HE LIKED    
          DINAH'S CAP AND GOWN  

713
00:43:33,076 --> 00:43:34,844
          BETTER NOR ME CLOTHES.

714
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:38,413
    HE SAYS FOLKS LOOK BETTER   
    IN UGLY CLOTHES.            

715
00:43:38,414 --> 00:43:40,750
     NAY, NAY, I ONLY SAID      
     AS THEY SUIT DINAH.        

716
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:43,085
BUT IF I'D SAID                 
YOU'D LOOK PRETTY IN 'EM,       

717
00:43:43,086 --> 00:43:45,754
     I'D HAVE SAID NOTHING      
     BUT WHAT WAS TRUE.         

718
00:43:45,755 --> 00:43:47,790
Mrs. Poyser: DON'T YOU GET      
TOO COMFORTABLE THERE, HETTY.   

719
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,058
I WANT YOU TO TAKE TOTTY        
OFF UP TO HER BED               

720
00:43:50,059 --> 00:43:51,359
AFORE SHE WAKES                 
AND GETS FRETFUL.               

721
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,861
    LET ME LIFT HER FOR YOU.    

722
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:57,065
    ( violin plays softly )     

723
00:44:01,504 --> 00:44:03,805
            ( whispering )      
            Children's so heavy 
            when they're asleep.

724
00:44:24,794 --> 00:44:26,328
    I DO NOT WANNA GO           
    WITH HETTY.                 

725
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:27,629
         I WANT DINAH.          

726
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,098
WELL,                           
YOU CAN'T HAVE HER.             

727
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,400
TOTTY! TOTTY!                   

728
00:44:31,401 --> 00:44:33,369
        ( gasps )               

729
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,871
ME LOCKET, ME LOCKET!           

730
00:44:35,872 --> 00:44:37,072
NEVER MIND THE BEADS.           

731
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:42,911
PUT IT IN ME POCKET.            

732
00:44:44,747 --> 00:44:46,948
ADAM, PUT IN ME POCKET.         
QUICK!                          

733
00:45:04,033 --> 00:45:06,969
        ( ax chopping )         

734
00:45:08,538 --> 00:45:10,539
    ( birds chirping )          

735
00:45:15,645 --> 00:45:18,346
          ( creaking )          

736
00:45:27,657 --> 00:45:30,059
        ( sawing )              

737
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,767
                  EVENING, SIR. 
GOOD NIGHT, WILL.               

738
00:45:41,104 --> 00:45:43,939
          ( singing )           

739
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:07,062
       MY LITTLE, MY--        

740
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:24,779
  ( gasps )                     

741
00:46:29,252 --> 00:46:31,186
( whispering )                  
What'll we do? It's Adam.       

742
00:46:31,187 --> 00:46:32,288
              I'LL SPEAK TO HIM.

743
00:46:45,034 --> 00:46:46,969
Arthur: ADAM!                   

744
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:50,806
YOU'VE BEEN TAKING A LOOK       
AT THE BEECHES, HAVE YOU?       

745
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:55,143
FINE OLD TREES,                 
AREN'T THEY?                    

746
00:46:57,313 --> 00:47:00,682
I OVERTOOK                      
PRETTY HETTY SORREL JUST NOW.   

747
00:47:00,683 --> 00:47:02,951
SHE OUGHT NOT TO COME HOME      
THIS WAY SO LATE.               

748
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,455
SO I TOOK CARE OF HER           
TO THE GATE                     

749
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:08,958
AND ASKED FOR A KISS            
FOR MY PAINS.                   

750
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,595
             WELL, GOOD NIGHT,  
             ADAM.              

751
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:14,396
I'LL SEE YOU TO SAY GOOD-BYE    
IN THE MORNING.                 

752
00:47:14,397 --> 00:47:16,198
             STOP A MINUTE, SIR.

753
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:19,201
             I'VE GOT A WORD    
             TO SAY TO YOU.     

754
00:47:19,202 --> 00:47:21,770
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?               

755
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:24,907
      I MEAN, SIR,              
      THAT YOU DON'T DECEIVE ME.

756
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,211
              THIS ISN'T        
              THE FIRST TIME    

757
00:47:29,212 --> 00:47:31,447

              HETTY SORREL HERE.

758
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:33,682
    THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME   
    YOU'VE KISSED HER.          

759
00:47:35,017 --> 00:47:36,651
    WELL...                     

760
00:47:36,652 --> 00:47:39,488
SIR, WHAT THEN?                 

761
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:44,226
        YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO
        WHAT IT LEADS TO,       

762
00:47:44,227 --> 00:47:45,394
        WHEN A GENTLEMAN        
        LIKE YOU                

763
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:47,362
        KISSES A YOUNG WOMAN    
        LIKE HETTY.             

764
00:47:47,363 --> 00:47:48,964
YOU TAKE IT                     
TOO SERIOUSLY.                  

765
00:47:48,965 --> 00:47:51,900
IT'S ONLY A FLIRTATION,         
AND EVERY GIRL LIKES            
TO BE FLIRTED WITH.             

766
00:47:51,901 --> 00:47:53,902
BESIDES, AS YOU KNOW,           
I SHALL BE GOING AWAY TOMORROW  

767
00:47:53,903 --> 00:47:57,005
SO I SHAN'T BE MAKING           
ANY MORE MISTAKES               
OF THAT KIND.                   

768
00:47:57,006 --> 00:47:59,241
LET'S SAY GOODNIGHT             
AND TALK NO MORE OF IT.         

769
00:47:59,242 --> 00:48:00,242
             NO, BY GOD!        

770
00:48:00,243 --> 00:48:01,376
             I'LL NOT           
             SO EASILY FORGET   

771
00:48:01,377 --> 00:48:04,146
             AS YOU'VE ROBBED ME
             OF ME HAPPINESS.   

772
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:05,647
YOUR HAPPINESS?                 

773
00:48:06,716 --> 00:48:08,383
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.             

774
00:48:08,384 --> 00:48:11,086
             THE ONLY AMENDS    
             YOU CAN MAKE ME NOW
             IS TO FIGHT.       

775
00:48:11,087 --> 00:48:12,354
WHAT ARE YOU                    
TALKING ABOUT?                  

776
00:48:14,056 --> 00:48:16,791
        HETTY?                  

777
00:48:16,792 --> 00:48:18,327
  GO AWAY, ADAM.                

778
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:19,561
I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT YOU.      

779
00:48:19,562 --> 00:48:21,463
             NO, YOU DO NOT WANT
             TO FIGHT ME.       

780
00:48:21,464 --> 00:48:23,065
      YOU THINK I'M A COMMON MAN
      YOU CAN INJURE            

781
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,466
      WITHOUT ANSWERING FOR IT. 

782
00:48:24,467 --> 00:48:27,703
GO AWAY, I TELL YOU,            
OR WE'LL BOTH REPENT IT!        

783
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:28,837
                NO!             

784
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:30,305
             I SWEAR I WON'T GO 
             WITHOUT FIGHTING!  

785
00:48:30,306 --> 00:48:31,873
             YOU WANT PROVOKING,
             DO YOU?            

786
00:48:31,874 --> 00:48:33,474
        THEN I SAY YOU'RE NOT   
        THE UPRIGHT GENTLEMAN   

787
00:48:33,475 --> 00:48:34,976
        WE ALL TOOK YOU FOR.    

788
00:48:34,977 --> 00:48:37,946
        YOU'RE A COWARD,        
        AND A SCOUNDREL,        
        AND I DESPISE YOU!      

789
00:48:52,795 --> 00:48:54,195
( Arthur groans )               

790
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:01,770
                        AH!     

791
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:21,223
                 I'M SORRY, SIR.

792
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,729
                      SIR?      

793
00:49:30,332 --> 00:49:31,967

794
00:49:40,074 --> 00:49:41,575

         birds singing )        

795
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,050
     IT'S A LEATHER BOTTLE.     

796
00:49:55,789 --> 00:49:57,290
            ( filling glass )   

797
00:50:01,996 --> 00:50:03,330
                  DO YOU FEEL   
                  ANY HURT, SIR?

798
00:50:04,699 --> 00:50:08,101
( chokes )                      
NO, NO HURT.                    

799
00:50:08,102 --> 00:50:10,103
BUT RATHER DONE UP.             

800
00:50:10,104 --> 00:50:12,372
YOU THOUGHT                     
YOU'D DONE FOR ME,              

801
00:50:12,373 --> 00:50:13,306
DIDN'T YOU?                     

802
00:50:14,576 --> 00:50:16,710
            ME TEMPER GOT       
            THE BETTER OF ME.   

803
00:50:16,711 --> 00:50:18,946
         AND PERHAPS            
         I JUDGED YOU TOO HARSH.

804
00:50:18,947 --> 00:50:20,180
                YOU'D NO GROUNDS
                TO KNOW         

805
00:50:20,181 --> 00:50:21,949
            YOU WERE DOING ME   
            AN INJURY.          

806
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:23,750
            GOD KNOWS,          
            IT'S ALL THE JOY    
            I COULD HAVE NOW,   

807
00:50:23,751 --> 00:50:24,952
                TO THINK        
                THE BEST OF YOU.

808
00:50:24,953 --> 00:50:25,953
WELL LET'S SAY                  
NO MORE                         

809
00:50:25,954 --> 00:50:27,387
ABOUT OUR ANGER,                
ADAM, EH?                       

810
00:50:27,388 --> 00:50:28,956
WE'LL BE NONE                   
THE WORSE FRIENDS,              

811
00:50:28,957 --> 00:50:30,691
I HOPE,                         
FOR HAVING FOUGHT.              

812
00:50:30,692 --> 00:50:32,626
COME, SHAKE HANDS.              

813
00:50:36,598 --> 00:50:38,565
            I CANNOT SHAKE HANDS
            'TILL IT'S CLEAR    

814
00:50:38,566 --> 00:50:40,100
             WHAT WE MEAN BY IT.

815
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:43,403
         HAVEN'T I BEEN         
     CLEAR ENOUGH ALREADY?      

816
00:50:43,404 --> 00:50:46,206
         YOU'RE TAKING          
      A LITTLE FLIRTATION       

817
00:50:46,207 --> 00:50:47,708
    FAR TOO SERIOUSLY.          

818
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:52,779
THIS ISN'T A TRIFLE             
TO ME, SIR...                   

819
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,481
WHATEVER IT MAY BE              
TO YOU.                         

820
00:50:55,482 --> 00:50:57,450
BUT IF IT'S TRUE                
WHAT YOU SAY...                 

821
00:50:57,451 --> 00:50:58,752
IF THERE'S BEEN                 
NOTHING MORE                    

822
00:50:58,753 --> 00:51:01,088
THAN A FEW KISSES...            

823
00:51:01,089 --> 00:51:02,089
WELL, THEN,                     

824
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:04,224
I'LL BELIEVE YOUR WORD,         

825
00:51:04,225 --> 00:51:07,094
FOR I'M LOATHE                  
TO THINK YOU'D SPEAK FALSE.     

826
00:51:07,095 --> 00:51:09,196
                  AND YOU'D BE  
                  WRONGING HETTY

827
00:51:09,197 --> 00:51:10,830
                MORE THAN ME    
                TO THINK IT.    

828
00:51:10,831 --> 00:51:14,234
          YOU CAN'T SUSPECT ME  
          WITHOUT INSULTING HER.

829
00:51:14,235 --> 00:51:16,103
NAY, NAY, SIR.                  

830
00:51:16,104 --> 00:51:18,805
THINGS DO NOT LIE LEVEL         
BETWEEN HETTY AND YOU.          

831
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,742
SHE'S ALL BUT A CHILD,          

832
00:51:22,743 --> 00:51:24,211
AS ANY MAN OF CONSCIENCE        

833
00:51:24,212 --> 00:51:26,313
OUGHT TO FEEL BOUND             
TO TAKE CARE OF.                

834
00:51:26,314 --> 00:51:27,447
WHATEVER YOU MAY THINK,         

835
00:51:27,448 --> 00:51:29,249
I KNOW YOU'VE PUT               
FALSE NOTIONS IN HER HEAD       

836
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:30,984
AND EXPENSIVE PRESENTS          
IN HER HAND.                    

837
00:51:30,985 --> 00:51:32,152
                 LEAVE ME ALONE!

838
00:51:32,153 --> 00:51:34,120
                GOOD GOD, ADAM, 
                I FEEL IT ENOUGH

839
00:51:34,121 --> 00:51:35,155
                WITHOUT YOU     
                WORRYING ME.    

840
00:51:35,156 --> 00:51:36,557
BUT THEN I ASK YOU              
TO UNDECEIVE HER                

841
00:51:36,558 --> 00:51:37,925
BEFORE YOU GO AWAY.             

842
00:51:37,926 --> 00:51:40,027
YOU WILL BE GONE                
FOR EVER.                       

843
00:51:40,028 --> 00:51:41,194
YOU MUSTN'T                     
LEAVE HER BEHIND                

844
00:51:41,195 --> 00:51:42,429
WITH SOME NOTION                
IN HER HEAD                     

845
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,797
THAT YOU LOVE HER.              
                 NO MORE NOW.   

846
00:51:43,798 --> 00:51:44,898
          I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

847
00:51:44,899 --> 00:51:45,966
WRITE TO HER.                   

848
00:51:45,967 --> 00:51:47,868
TELL HER THE TRUTH!             
TAKE THE BLAME YOURSELF.        

849
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:49,636
          I CAN DO              
          WHAT I THINK NECESSARY

850
00:51:49,637 --> 00:51:51,271
                WITHOUT MAKING  
                PROMISES TO YOU!

851
00:51:51,272 --> 00:51:53,139
            I SHALL TAKE        
            WHATEVER MEASURES   

852
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,174
                 I THINK PROPER.

853
00:51:54,175 --> 00:51:56,109
WELL, THAT'S NOT                
GOOD ENOUGH.                    

854
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:58,111
I MUST KNOW WHAT GROUND         
I'M TREADING ON.                

855
00:51:58,112 --> 00:51:59,746
I MUST BE SAFE                  
AS YOU'VE PUT AN END            

856
00:51:59,747 --> 00:52:01,048
TO WHAT OUGHT TO NEVER          
HAVE STARTED.                   

857
00:52:01,049 --> 00:52:02,816
            I CAN'T STAND       
            ANY MORE OF THIS.   

858
00:52:02,817 --> 00:52:04,217
EITHER TELL ME OUTRIGHT         

859
00:52:04,218 --> 00:52:05,986
AS SHE CAN NEVER BE             
ME WIFE.                        

860
00:52:07,555 --> 00:52:09,089
TELL ME                         
YOU'VE BEEN LYING...            

861
00:52:11,859 --> 00:52:13,927
OR ELSE PROMISE ME              
WHAT I'VE SAID.                 

862
00:52:20,501 --> 00:52:21,435
                    I PROMISE.

1084
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:20,912
                    NAY, NAY!   

1085
01:05:20,913 --> 01:05:22,548
            I CAME              
            TO FETCH HETTY BACK.

1086
01:05:22,549 --> 01:05:24,283
    HETTY?                      

1087
01:05:24,284 --> 01:05:25,717
                      AYE...    

1088
01:05:25,718 --> 01:05:27,219
                YOU TOO.        

1089
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:28,755
    IF YOU'RE WILLING, DINAH.   

1090
01:05:28,756 --> 01:05:31,323
HETTY'S NOT HERE.               

1091
01:05:32,659 --> 01:05:34,326
        BUT SHE CAME TO SEE YOU.

1092
01:05:34,327 --> 01:05:36,328
         FRIDAY WAS A FORTNIGHT.

1093
01:05:36,329 --> 01:05:38,497
        SHE CAME TO FETCH YOU   
        TO OUR WEDDING.         

1094
01:05:42,969 --> 01:05:45,571
HETTY'S NOT BEEN HERE.          

1095
01:05:45,572 --> 01:05:47,540
NOR SENT WORD.                  

1096
01:05:53,013 --> 01:05:54,714
LORD HAVE MERCY!                

1097
01:05:58,118 --> 01:06:00,319
                  I CANNOT STOP.

1098
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:01,787
                I MUST FIND HER.

1099
01:06:30,717 --> 01:06:33,786
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.             

1100
01:06:33,787 --> 01:06:35,420
I DROPPED                       
SUCH A LASS HERE,               

1101
01:06:35,421 --> 01:06:37,256
OH, A FORTNIGHT AGO.            

1102
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:41,693
MAKING FOR ASHBY                
SHE WAS.                        

1103
01:06:41,694 --> 01:06:44,796
MIND I LOST SIGHT OF HER        
DIRECTLY I GOT DOWN.            

1104
01:06:44,797 --> 01:06:46,932
BUT, I'D NOT LIKELY FORGET      

1105
01:06:46,933 --> 01:06:49,068
SUCH A PRETTY LASS AS THAT.     

1106
01:06:49,069 --> 01:06:50,535
( laughs )                      

1107
01:07:16,897 --> 01:07:18,898
        ( dog barking )         

1108
01:07:20,266 --> 01:07:21,801
GOD BLESS ON US!                

1109
01:07:23,904 --> 01:07:26,972
YOU'D BEEN GONE SO LONG         
WE WERE WORRIED.                

1110
01:07:26,973 --> 01:07:28,541
WHAT IS IT?                     

1111
01:07:28,542 --> 01:07:30,776
IS IT DEATH?                    

1112
01:07:30,777 --> 01:07:32,177
IS SHE DEAD?                    

1113
01:07:32,178 --> 01:07:36,114
            NAY, BUT SHE'S GONE.

1114
01:07:36,115 --> 01:07:38,451
         SHE'S NEVER BEEN THERE.

1115
01:07:38,452 --> 01:07:40,018
                 HETTY NEVER GOT
                 TO SNOWFIELD   

1116
01:07:40,019 --> 01:07:42,688
            AND I CANNOT FIND   
            WHERE SHE'S GONE.   

1117
01:07:42,689 --> 01:07:45,424
DO YOU HAVE ANY NOTION          
WHAT SHE'S DONE IT FOR?         

1118
01:07:45,425 --> 01:07:47,492
    SHE CANNOT HAVE LOVED ME.   

1119
01:07:50,897 --> 01:07:53,766
         I SHOULDN'T HAVE       
         PRESSED HER LIKE I DID.

1120
01:07:53,767 --> 01:07:55,201
            SHE DIDN'T          
            LIKE OUR MARRIAGE   

1121
01:07:55,202 --> 01:07:57,002
              WHEN IT CAME NIGH.

1122
01:07:57,003 --> 01:07:59,238
                THAT MUST BE IT!

1123
01:07:59,239 --> 01:08:02,908
                  ( sobbing )   

1124
01:08:05,946 --> 01:08:09,381
         I CANNOT FIND          
         WHERE SHE'S GONE, SETH.

1125
01:08:16,823 --> 01:08:18,858
             I CAME TO YOU, SIR,
             AS THE ONE MAN     

1126
01:08:18,859 --> 01:08:20,726
                 I CAN TRUST    
                 WITH THE TRUTH.

1127
01:08:23,329 --> 01:08:25,331
        YOU WERE TO HAVE MARRIED
        ME AND HETTY SORREL     

1128
01:08:25,332 --> 01:08:27,199
                ON THE 15TH     
                OF THIS MONTH.  

1129
01:08:29,302 --> 01:08:31,503
    BUT SHE'S GONE AWAY, SIR.   

1130
01:08:31,504 --> 01:08:33,272
        AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE.

1131
01:08:37,477 --> 01:08:40,846
            THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE
            CONCERNED BESIDE ME.

1132
01:08:40,847 --> 01:08:42,815
        SOMEONE WHO PLAYED      
        WITH HETTY'S FEELINGS   

1133
01:08:42,816 --> 01:08:44,850
         AS A MAN IN HIS STATION
         HAD NO RIGHT.          

1134
01:08:46,152 --> 01:08:48,653
          SOMEONE WHO I RECKONED
          ME GREATEST FRIEND.   

1135
01:08:52,459 --> 01:08:53,525
                  AND NOW...    

1136
01:08:56,697 --> 01:08:58,731
                I DO NOT WANT   
                TO BLAME HER.   

1137
01:09:01,501 --> 01:09:03,034
                 IT MUST BE THAT

1138
01:09:03,035 --> 01:09:05,103
            HE'S SENT FOR HER   
            TO JOIN HIM.        

1139
01:09:05,104 --> 01:09:06,639
                THAT'S WHERE    
                SHE MUST BE,    

1140
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,274
      AND I'M GOING TO FIND HER.

1141
01:09:08,275 --> 01:09:09,241
NO, STAY!                       

1142
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:11,543
ADAM...                         

1143
01:09:14,615 --> 01:09:15,881
MY DEAR FRIEND.                 

1144
01:09:17,517 --> 01:09:20,519
I FEAR                          
AN EVEN HEAVIER BLOW            

1145
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:23,589
IS ABOUT TO FALL ON YOU.        

1146
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:25,957
I HAVE NEWS                     
OF HETTY HERE.                  

1147
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:27,893
SHE'S NOT GONE TO HIM.          

1148
01:09:29,195 --> 01:09:32,364
ARTHUR IS ON HIS WAY HOME       
FROM IRELAND.                   

1149
01:09:32,365 --> 01:09:35,200
I WROTE TO HIM                  
TEN DAYS AGO                    

1150
01:09:35,201 --> 01:09:37,670
WHEN I KNEW                     
HIS GRANDFATHER WAS DYING.      

1151
01:09:45,579 --> 01:09:47,345
                  WHERE'S HETTY?

1152
01:09:48,982 --> 01:09:50,282
AT STONITON.                    

1153
01:09:52,485 --> 01:09:54,252
SHE'S BEEN ARRESTED.            

1154
01:09:55,622 --> 01:09:57,188
SHE'S IN PRISON.                

1155
01:10:01,895 --> 01:10:03,161
                    FOR WHAT?   

1156
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:06,765
FOR THE MURDER OF HER CHILD.    

1157
01:10:16,142 --> 01:10:17,676
                IT CANNOT BE.   

1158
01:10:21,014 --> 01:10:22,448
              IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

1159
01:10:24,183 --> 01:10:25,717
        SHE'S NEVER HAD A CHILD.

1160
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:32,191
            HOW CAN HETTY       
            HAVE HAD A CHILD?   

1161
01:10:37,197 --> 01:10:39,064
                    WHO SAYS SO?

1162
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:43,302
I HAVE A LETTER HERE            
FROM THE MAGISTRATE             

1163
01:10:43,303 --> 01:10:46,438
ASKING ME TO GO                 
AND IDENTIFY HER.               

1164
01:10:55,015 --> 01:10:57,683
            WHAT PROOF STANDS   
            AGAINST HER?        

1165
01:10:57,684 --> 01:10:59,418
            I'LL NOT BELIEVE IT.

1166
01:11:02,556 --> 01:11:04,923
                OH...           

1167
01:11:04,924 --> 01:11:07,326
         IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN  
         AND NONE OF US KNOW IT.

1168
01:11:11,631 --> 01:11:12,864
COME.                           

1169
01:11:12,865 --> 01:11:14,800
WE MUST TAKE SOME ACTION        

1170
01:11:14,801 --> 01:11:16,235
OR WE SHALL GO MAD.             

1171
01:11:17,737 --> 01:11:19,905
WE'LL GO TOGETHER               
TO STONITON                     

1172
01:11:21,074 --> 01:11:22,108
AND FIND OUT                    

1173
01:11:22,109 --> 01:11:24,076
IF IT IS HETTY OR NOT.          

1174
01:11:24,077 --> 01:11:27,012
                  ( gate opens )

1175
01:11:28,348 --> 01:11:30,516
              ( keys jangling  )

1176
01:11:37,924 --> 01:11:39,258
                 HETTY, MY DEAR!

1177
01:11:44,464 --> 01:11:46,932
      ( horses clomping )       

1178
01:11:49,969 --> 01:11:52,270
        SHE DIDN'T SPEAK A WORD,

1179
01:11:52,271 --> 01:11:55,408
              SEEMED HARDLY EVEN
              TO NOTICE ME,     

1180
01:11:55,409 --> 01:11:56,809
            AND WHEN THE CAPTAIN
            ASKED HER           

1181
01:11:56,810 --> 01:11:58,511
            IF SHE'D LIKE TO SEE
            SOME OF HER FAMILY, 

1182
01:11:58,512 --> 01:12:00,078
        SHE SAID, "TELL THEM    

1183
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:01,714
        "NOT TO COME NEAR ME.   

1184
01:12:01,715 --> 01:12:03,982
          "I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK
          TO ANY OF THEM."      

1185
01:12:05,685 --> 01:12:08,421
HOW STANDS THE PROOF            
AGAINST HER, SIR?               

1186
01:12:08,422 --> 01:12:11,690
        THE DOCTOR'S EVIDENCE   
        WEIGHS HEAVILY,         

1187
01:12:11,691 --> 01:12:13,592
        AND I FEAR              
        THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT   

1188
01:12:13,593 --> 01:12:15,528
        THAT HETTY              
        DID GIVE BIRTH          

1189
01:12:15,529 --> 01:12:18,496
            TO A CHILD RECENTLY,
            BUT...              

1190
01:12:18,497 --> 01:12:21,300
         LIKE THE SILLY CREATURE
         SHE IS, SHE DENIES IT. 

1191
01:12:22,368 --> 01:12:23,435
OH, GOD!                        

1192
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:26,972
OH, IT'S TOO HARD               
TO LAY UPON ME!                 

1193
01:12:29,775 --> 01:12:31,276
I THOUGHT SHE LOVED ME          

1194
01:12:31,277 --> 01:12:33,111
AND I WAS GOOD.                 

1195
01:12:33,112 --> 01:12:35,214
BUT SHE'S NEVER AS GUILTY       
AS THEY SAY, SIR.               

1196
01:12:35,215 --> 01:12:38,117
YOU DON'T THINK                 
SHE IS, DO YOU?                 

1197
01:12:38,118 --> 01:12:40,119
SHE CANNOT HAVE MURDERED        
HER OWN CHILD.                  

1198
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,220
SHE CANNOT!                     

1199
01:12:42,388 --> 01:12:43,588
              WE MAY NEVER KNOW.

1200
01:12:44,724 --> 01:12:47,126
          SHE DENIES EVERYTHING.

1201
01:12:47,127 --> 01:12:50,129
             BUT IF THE EVIDENCE
             SPEAKS TOO STRONGLY
             AGAINST HER,       

1202
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:51,964
              WE CAN HOPE       
              FOR A PARDON.     

1203
01:12:53,132 --> 01:12:57,202
             HER INNOCENCE AND  
             OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES

1204
01:12:57,203 --> 01:12:58,403
             WILL PLEAD FOR HER.

1205
01:13:00,339 --> 01:13:01,974
SOMEONE ELSE                    
SHOULD BE IN THE DOCK           

1206
01:13:01,975 --> 01:13:03,308
INSTEAD OF HETTY.               

1207
01:13:03,309 --> 01:13:04,977
I DO NOT CARE                   
WHAT SHE'S DONE.                

1208
01:13:04,978 --> 01:13:06,679
IT WAS HIM                      
BROUGHT HER TO IT.              

1209
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,880
THERE'S FOLK HANGED             
FOR THINGS                      

1210
01:13:07,881 --> 01:13:09,247
NO HALF SO HATEFUL.             

1211
01:13:09,248 --> 01:13:12,117
AND I NEVER SO MUCH             
AS KISSED HER.                  

1212
01:13:12,118 --> 01:13:13,819
                IT DOES NO GOOD.

1213
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:16,655
            ADAM,               
            IT DOES NO GOOD!    

1214
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:19,424
 I KNOW...                      

1215
01:13:19,425 --> 01:13:21,560
  I KNOW!                       

1216
01:13:26,566 --> 01:13:27,599
MY POOR HETTY!                  

1217
01:13:29,902 --> 01:13:31,370
IT CAN NEVER BE UNDONE.         

1218
01:13:34,807 --> 01:13:36,908
            I'M WILLING TO PAY  
            ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY 

1219
01:13:36,909 --> 01:13:39,378
        AS IS WANTED TOWARDS    
        TRYING TO BRING HER OFF,

1220
01:13:39,379 --> 01:13:41,313
    BUT I'LL NOT GO NEAR HER,   

1221
01:13:41,314 --> 01:13:43,915
         NOR EVEN SEE HER AGAIN,
         BY ME OWN WILL.        

1222
01:13:45,018 --> 01:13:46,518
                SHE'S MADE      
                OUR BREAD BITTER

1223
01:13:46,519 --> 01:13:48,720
            FOR ALL OUR LIVES   
            TO COME.            

1224
01:13:50,256 --> 01:13:51,657
             WE'LL NEVER HOLD UP
             OUR HEADS          

1225
01:13:51,658 --> 01:13:53,558
        IN THIS PARISH AGAIN,   

1226
01:13:53,559 --> 01:13:54,793
            NOR ANY OTHER.      

1227
01:13:56,796 --> 01:13:58,864
          WE THOUGHT            
          IT WOULD BE TURNED OUT

1228
01:13:58,865 --> 01:14:00,866
              BY THE OLD SQUIRE.

1229
01:14:00,867 --> 01:14:01,934
                WELL...         

1230
01:14:01,935 --> 01:14:03,502
         NOW HE'S DEAD AND GONE.

1231
01:14:03,503 --> 01:14:05,337
      I MUST GIVE MYSELF NOTICE,

1232
01:14:05,338 --> 01:14:07,205
        FOR I WON'T STAY        
        ON THE NEW SQUIRE'S LAND

1233
01:14:07,206 --> 01:14:09,274
             A DAY LONGER       
             THAN I'M FORCED TO.

1234
01:14:12,311 --> 01:14:14,747
    AND ME AS THOUGHT HIM       
    SUCH A GOOD                 

1235
01:14:14,748 --> 01:14:17,282
UPRIGHT YOUNG MAN.              

1236
01:14:17,283 --> 01:14:18,350
I SHOULD BE GLAD                

1237
01:14:18,351 --> 01:14:21,020
WHEN HE COMES HOME              
TO BE OUR LANDLORD!             

1238
01:14:21,021 --> 01:14:23,555
I'LL NEVER LIFT ME HAT          
TO HIM AGAIN,                   

1239
01:14:23,556 --> 01:14:25,824
NOR SIT IN THE SAME CHURCH      
WITH HIM...                     

1240
01:14:27,527 --> 01:14:30,328
     A MAN WHO'S BROUGHT        
     SHAME ON RESPECTABLE FOLKS.

1241
01:15:02,862 --> 01:15:04,797
    ( gavel pounding )          

1242
01:15:04,798 --> 01:15:07,832
PRAY SILENCE IN THE COURT.      

1243
01:15:12,638 --> 01:15:13,572
     PRISONER IN THE DOCK.      

1244
01:15:13,573 --> 01:15:14,773
         HOW PLEAD YOU,         

1245
01:15:14,774 --> 01:15:17,209
     GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY?      

1246
01:15:18,211 --> 01:15:19,878
          NOT GUILTY.           

1247
01:15:19,879 --> 01:15:21,746
         ( whispering )         

1248
01:15:30,123 --> 01:15:31,790
           Hetty:               
           <i>NOT GUILTY.</i>          

1249
01:15:34,594 --> 01:15:36,929
    MY NAME IS SARAH STONE.     

1250
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:39,297
    I AM A WIDOW                
    AND KEEP A SMALL SHOP       

1251
01:15:39,298 --> 01:15:41,467
    IN CHURCH LANE.             

1252
01:15:41,468 --> 01:15:43,702
    THE PRISONER AT THE BAR     

1253
01:15:43,703 --> 01:15:45,203
    IS THE SAME YOUNG WOMAN     

1254
01:15:45,204 --> 01:15:46,672
    WHO CAME AND ASKED          
    FOR A LODGING               

1255
01:15:46,673 --> 01:15:47,973
    AT MY HOUSE,                

1256
01:15:47,974 --> 01:15:49,508
    ON SATURDAY EVENING,        

1257
01:15:49,509 --> 01:15:52,210
    THE 27TH OF FEBRUARY.       

1258
01:15:53,713 --> 01:15:57,383
    WHEN I SAID                 
    I DIDN'T TAKE IN LODGERS,   

1259
01:15:57,384 --> 01:15:59,484
    THE PRISONER                
    BEGAN TO CRY.               

1260
01:15:59,485 --> 01:16:00,885
    SHE SAID                    
    SHE WAS TOO TIRED           

1261
01:16:00,886 --> 01:16:02,554
    TO GO ANYWHERE ELSE,        

1262
01:16:02,555 --> 01:16:04,722
    AND SHE ONLY WANTED A BED   
    FOR ONE NIGHT.              

1263
01:16:06,525 --> 01:16:08,593
    HER PRETTINESS              

1264
01:16:08,594 --> 01:16:10,695
    AND HER CONDITION           

1265
01:16:10,696 --> 01:16:11,830
    AND SOMETHING...            

1266
01:16:11,831 --> 01:16:14,767
    RESPECTABLE                 
    ABOUT HER CLOTHES AND LOOKS 

1267
01:16:14,768 --> 01:16:16,735
    MADE ME AS...               
    I COULDN'T FIND IT          

1268
01:16:16,736 --> 01:16:18,637
    IN MY HEART                 
    TO SEND HER AWAY.           

1269
01:16:21,207 --> 01:16:22,875
    THEN, IN THE NIGHT,         

1270
01:16:22,876 --> 01:16:25,043
    A BABY WAS BORN.            

1271
01:16:25,044 --> 01:16:27,880
    SOONER THAN                 
    THE YOUNG WOMAN EXPECTED,   

1272
01:16:27,881 --> 01:16:29,681
    I DIDN'T CALL               
    FOR A DOCTOR                

1273
01:16:29,682 --> 01:16:31,583
    FOR THERE SEEMED            
    NO NEED.                    

1274
01:16:31,584 --> 01:16:32,984
    I TOOK A DEAL OF TROUBLE    

1275
01:16:32,985 --> 01:16:35,486
    FOR BOTH THE CHILD          
    AND THE MOTHER.             

1276
01:16:35,487 --> 01:16:38,189
    I COULDN'T HELP             
    TAKING TO THE LITTLE THING  

1277
01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:41,059
    AND BEING ANXIOUS           
    ABOUT IT.                   

1278
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:44,730
    BUT I WASN'T QUITE EASY     
    WHAT I SHOULD DO,           

1279
01:16:44,731 --> 01:16:47,900
    SO TOWARDS EVENING,         
    THE NEXT DAY...             

1280
01:16:47,901 --> 01:16:50,001
    I MADE UP MY MIND           
    TO GO AND SPEAK             

1281
01:16:50,002 --> 01:16:52,438
    TO OUR MINISTER             
    ABOUT IT.                   

1282
01:16:52,439 --> 01:16:54,873
    AND WHEN I GOT BACK,        

1283
01:16:54,874 --> 01:16:56,475
    THE CANDLE                  
    WAS STILL BURNING           

1284
01:16:56,476 --> 01:16:58,176
    JUST AS I'D LEFT IT,        

1285
01:16:58,177 --> 01:16:59,544
    BUT THE PRISONER            
    AND THE BABY                

1286
01:16:59,545 --> 01:17:01,747
    WERE BOTH GONE.             

1287
01:17:01,748 --> 01:17:04,349
    OH, I WAS                   
    DREADFUL FRIGHTENED.        

1288
01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:06,517
    YEAH, AND ANGRY             
    WITH HER FOR GOING.         

1289
01:17:08,354 --> 01:17:11,123
    BUT I DIDN'T GIVE           
    INFORMATION ON HER.         

1290
01:17:11,124 --> 01:17:14,026
    I DIDN'T LIKE TO SET        
    THE CONSTABLE AFTER HER,    

1291
01:17:14,027 --> 01:17:17,729
    FOR SHE'D A RIGHT TO GO     
    FROM ME IF SHE LIKED.       

1292
01:17:17,730 --> 01:17:20,598
  CAN YOU IDENTIFY              
  THESE CLOTHES                 

1293
01:17:20,599 --> 01:17:24,102
  AS THOSE IN WHICH YOU         
  YOURSELF DRESSED THE CHILD?   

1294
01:17:24,103 --> 01:17:25,703
                      OH, YES.  

1295
01:17:25,704 --> 01:17:27,839
                 YES, THESE ARE 
                 THE CLOTHES.   

1296
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,274
                 I MADE         
                 THEM MESELF... 

1297
01:17:29,275 --> 01:17:30,609
                 AND KEPT THEM  
                 BY ME          

1298
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:32,344
             SINCE MY LAST CHILD
             WAS BORN.          

1299
01:17:34,213 --> 01:17:36,281
      ( crowd murmuring )       

1300
01:17:42,722 --> 01:17:44,957
    MY NAME IS JOHN OLDING.     

1301
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:46,892
        I AM A LABORER.         

1302
01:17:46,893 --> 01:17:49,360
    AND LIVE AT TED'S HOLT,     

1303
01:17:49,361 --> 01:17:51,362
FIVE MILE OUT OF STONITON.      

1304
01:17:53,366 --> 01:17:55,701
IT WAS A WEEK LAST MONDAY       
         I WAS HEADING          

1305
01:17:55,702 --> 01:17:57,636
     TOWARDS HETTON COPSE,      

1306
01:17:57,637 --> 01:18:02,440
  AND ABOUT QUARTER OF A MILE   
      FROM THE COPPICE...       

1307
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:06,678
    I SAW THE PRISONER          

1308
01:18:06,679 --> 01:18:09,815
    SITTIN' UNDER A HAYSTACK    

1309
01:18:09,816 --> 01:18:11,049
          BY THE ROAD.          

1310
01:18:15,455 --> 01:18:17,789
      I THOUGHT SHE LOOKED      
          A BIT CRAZY,          

1311
01:18:19,825 --> 01:18:21,860
        BUT IT WAS              
      NO BUSINESS OF MINE.      

1312
01:18:26,132 --> 01:18:28,599
      I HADN'T GONE FAR...      

1313
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:31,936
        OUT OF THE ROAD         
    TOWARD THE COPPICE          

1314
01:18:31,937 --> 01:18:34,873
        AFORE I HEARD...        

1315
01:18:34,874 --> 01:18:36,107
         A STRANGE CRY.         

1316
01:18:38,477 --> 01:18:40,812
          THE CRY WAS           
     LIKE NO ANIMAL I KNOW.     

1317
01:18:42,648 --> 01:18:45,217
     BUT I WAS NOT STOPPING     
          JUST THEN...          

1318
01:18:45,218 --> 01:18:46,885
     SO I--I KEPT RIGHT ON.     

1319
01:18:48,287 --> 01:18:51,356
     BUT WHEN I COME BACK       
     NEAR AN HOUR LATER...      

1320
01:18:52,658 --> 01:18:54,359
    I REMEMBERED THE CRY...     

1321
01:18:56,061 --> 01:18:58,429
      AND I COULD NOT HELP      

1322
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:00,599
     LAYING DOWN MY STAKES      

1323
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,100
     TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.      

1324
01:19:03,636 --> 01:19:06,238
SO AFTER I'D POKED AROUND       

1325
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:08,907
     IN THE LEAVES AWHILE,      

1326
01:19:08,908 --> 01:19:11,409
     I SAW SOMETHING ODD...     

1327
01:19:12,912 --> 01:19:16,581
    ROUND...WHITISH...          

1328
01:19:16,582 --> 01:19:19,284
      LYING ON THE GROUND       
    UNDER A NUT-BUSH.           

1329
01:19:24,557 --> 01:19:27,426
        SO I STOOPED            
        TO PICK IT UP...        

1330
01:19:29,962 --> 01:19:32,164
            AND SAW             
     IT WAS A BABY'S HAND.      

1331
01:19:32,165 --> 01:19:34,199
      ( crowd murmuring )       

1332
01:19:38,637 --> 01:19:39,771
         I PUSHED AWAY          

1333
01:19:39,772 --> 01:19:41,906
    THE TURF AND THE LEAVES     
    THAT LAY AROUND...          

1334
01:19:43,909 --> 01:19:45,477
    AND PULLED OUT A CHILD.     

1335
01:19:47,613 --> 01:19:50,315
         IT HAD GOT...          

1336
01:19:50,316 --> 01:19:52,050
    COMFORTABLE CLOTHES ON,     

1337
01:19:52,051 --> 01:19:54,953
    BUT HIS BODY WAS COLD,      

1338
01:19:54,954 --> 01:19:56,654
          SO I THOUGHT          

1339
01:19:56,655 --> 01:19:59,024
    MAYBE IT WAS DEAD.          

1340
01:19:59,025 --> 01:20:01,559
          I MADE HASTE          
        OUT OF THE WOOD         

1341
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,095
        AND TOOK IT HOME        
          TO MY WIFE.           

1342
01:20:06,899 --> 01:20:08,733
     SHE SAID IT WAS DEAD.      

1343
01:20:10,069 --> 01:20:12,837
        I'D BEST TAKE IT        
         TO THE PARISH          

1344
01:20:12,838 --> 01:20:14,339
    AND TELL THE CONSTABLE.     

1345
01:20:21,747 --> 01:20:24,749
        THE NEXT MORNING        
     THE CONSTABLE ASKED ME     

1346
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:26,684
    TO TAKE HIM TO THE SPOT.    

1347
01:20:28,755 --> 01:20:30,355
    AND WHEN WE GOT THERE...    

1348
01:20:32,425 --> 01:20:33,958
        THERE WAS               
     THE PRISONER AGAIN...      

1349
01:20:36,629 --> 01:20:39,431
    SITTING AGAINST THE BUSH    

1350
01:20:39,432 --> 01:20:41,065
    WHERE I FOUND THE CHILD.    

1351
01:20:46,973 --> 01:20:49,107
          SHE'D GOT...          

1352
01:20:51,043 --> 01:20:53,845
      A BIG PIECE OF BREAD      
         ON HER LAP...          

1353
01:20:55,981 --> 01:20:59,017
     AND WHEN SHE SAW US...     

1354
01:20:59,018 --> 01:21:00,485
CRIED OUT SOMETHING CRUEL.      

1355
01:21:06,692 --> 01:21:09,193
    ( sobs )                    

1356
01:21:17,336 --> 01:21:20,505
    Irwine: "MY DEAR ARTHUR,    
    I SEND THIS LETTER          

1357
01:21:20,506 --> 01:21:21,839

     GUILTY, OR NOT GUILTY?     

1369

                      GUILTY.

YOU HAVE BEEN FOUND GUILTY      

1373

1374
01:22:24,836 --> 01:22:27,872
THE MURDER OF YOUR CHILD.

    AND THENCE

01:22:58,036 --> 01:23:00,304
             ( screams )        

1387
01:23:01,774 --> 01:23:03,274
                  Adam: HETTY!  

1388
01:23:16,922 --> 01:23:18,523
    ( chains rattle )           

1389
01:23:25,598 --> 01:23:27,532
        ( key rattling )        

1390
01:23:37,376 --> 01:23:39,076
ADAM'S HERE NOW, HETTY.         

1391
01:23:43,882 --> 01:23:45,750
YOU SAID                        
YOU WANTED TO SEE HIM.          

1392
01:24:11,376 --> 01:24:13,477
TELL HIM WHAT'S                 
IN YOUR HEART, HETTY.           

1393
01:24:15,981 --> 01:24:18,182
                I WILL TELL...  

1394
01:24:18,183 --> 01:24:20,652
            FOR I CANNOT HIDE IT
            ANY MORE.           

1395
01:24:25,891 --> 01:24:27,392
                I DID DO IT.    

1396
01:24:29,728 --> 01:24:31,496
                I--I BURIED IT  
                IN THE WOOD,    

1397
01:24:31,497 --> 01:24:32,930
                THE LITTLE BABY.

1398
01:24:35,067 --> 01:24:37,635
             IT WAS BORN WHEN   
             I DIDN'T EXPECT IT,

1399
01:24:37,636 --> 01:24:39,437
             AND THE THOUGHT    
             CAME TO ME         

1400
01:24:39,438 --> 01:24:41,839
        I MIGHT GET RID OF IT   
        AND GO HOME AGAIN,      

1401
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,409
          AND NEVER LET 'EM KNOW
          WHY I RAN AWAY.       

1402
01:24:45,911 --> 01:24:48,646
          I'D MARRY YOU, ADAM,  
          AND NEVER TELL ANYONE.

1403
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:07,231
WHEN THE WOMAN LEFT ME ALONE,   

1404
01:25:07,232 --> 01:25:10,535
I WENT OUT INTO THE DARK        
WITH THE BABY UNDER ME CLOAK.   

1405
01:25:11,937 --> 01:25:15,106
      I WALKED ON AND ON        

1406
01:25:15,107 --> 01:25:18,409
      AND IT GOT LIGHTER,       
      FOR THERE CAME THE MOON.  

1407
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:22,446
      AND, OH, IT FRIGHTENED ME 
      WHEN IT FIRST LOOKED AT ME
      OUT OF THE CLOUDS!        

1408
01:25:22,447 --> 01:25:24,281
      IT NEVER LOOKED SO BEFORE.

1409
01:25:26,785 --> 01:25:29,854
      BUT I WENT INTO THE WOOD  
      AND I...                  

1410
01:25:29,855 --> 01:25:33,258
    I SAW A HOLE UNDER A TREE...

1411
01:25:33,259 --> 01:25:35,193
    LIKE A LITTLE GRAVE IT WAS, 

1412
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:39,898
    AND THE THOUGHT CAME TO ME: 

1413
01:25:39,899 --> 01:25:42,567
    I'D LAY THE BABY THERE      
    AND COVER IT UP.            

1414
01:25:44,169 --> 01:25:47,972
    AND I'D DONE IT IN A MINUTE,

1415
01:25:47,973 --> 01:25:50,975
    ONLY, OH, IT DID CRY SO!    

1416
01:25:52,011 --> 01:25:54,179
         ( Hetty sobs )         

1417
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:57,481
    I DON'T KNOW                
    HOW I FELT ABOUT THE BABY.  

1418
01:25:57,482 --> 01:25:59,350
    I SEEMED TO HATE IT.        

1419
01:25:59,351 --> 01:26:02,653
    IT WAS LIKE HEAVY WEIGHT    
    HANGING ROUND MY NECK.      

1420
01:26:02,654 --> 01:26:05,556
    YET ITS CRYING WENT RIGHT   
    THROUGH ME,                 

1421
01:26:07,225 --> 01:26:10,261
I COULDN'T BEAR TO LOOK         
AT ITS LITTLE FACE AND HANDS,   

1422
01:26:10,262 --> 01:26:14,331
 AND I COULDN'T COVER IT ALL UP.
 NOT QUITE.                     

1423
01:26:15,834 --> 01:26:18,602
  SEE, I THOUGHT                
  AS MAYBE SOMEBODY WOULD COME  

1424
01:26:18,603 --> 01:26:21,238
  AND TAKE CARE OF IT           
  AND THEN IT WOULDN'T DIE.     

1425
01:26:23,409 --> 01:26:25,577
  I MADE HASTE OUT OF THE WOOD, 

1426
01:26:25,578 --> 01:26:28,279
  ONLY I COULD HEAR IT CRYING   
  AT EVERY STEP,                

1427
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:31,649
 AND NO MATTER HOW FAR I WALKED,
 I COULD STILL HEAR IT.         

1428
01:26:33,018 --> 01:26:35,920
  I WENT BACK                   
  BECAUSE OF THE CRYING.        

1429
01:26:35,921 --> 01:26:37,922
  I'D LEFT OFF                  
  THINKING ABOUT GOING HOME.    

1430
01:26:37,923 --> 01:26:40,458
  IT HAD GONE OUT OF ME MIND.   

1431
01:26:40,459 --> 01:26:44,094
  I SAW NOTHING BUT THAT PLACE  
  IN THE WOOD WHERE I'D...      

1432
01:26:44,095 --> 01:26:45,930
  BURIED THE BABY.              

1433
01:26:47,032 --> 01:26:48,833
            ( sobs )            

1434
01:26:48,834 --> 01:26:51,001
  I THINK I SHALL ALWAYS SEE IT!

1435
01:26:54,273 --> 01:26:57,942
  I MET NOBODY.                 
  IT WAS VERY EARLY AND I...    

1436
01:26:57,943 --> 01:27:00,711
  I GOT INTO THE WOOD AGAIN EASY
  FOR I KNEW THE PLACE          

1437
01:27:00,712 --> 01:27:04,048
  AND I COULD HEAR IT CRYING    
  AT EVERY STEP.                

1438
01:27:05,050 --> 01:27:07,218
  IT MUST STILL BE ALIVE,       
  I THOUGHT.                    

1439
01:27:09,421 --> 01:27:13,391
  I DON'T KNOW                  
  IF I WAS SORRY OR GLAD.       

1440
01:27:13,392 --> 01:27:16,561
  I DON'T KNOW WHAT I FELT      
  'TIL I SAW HE WAS GONE.       

1441
01:27:17,896 --> 01:27:21,165
  I WAS STRUCK                  
  LIKE A STONE WITH FEAR,       

1442
01:27:21,166 --> 01:27:24,335
  ME HEART WERE LIKE STONE.     

1443
01:27:24,336 --> 01:27:27,738
  I COULDN'T WISH               
  NOR TRY FOR ANYTHING.         

1444
01:27:27,739 --> 01:27:31,509
  IT SEEMED LIKE AS IF          
  I SHOULD STAY THERE FOR EVER. 

1445
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:33,777
  BUT THEN THEY CAME            
  AND TOOK ME AWAY.             

1446
01:27:38,851 --> 01:27:41,085
  WILL GOD TAKE AWAY            
  THE CRYING                    

1447
01:27:41,086 --> 01:27:44,121
  AND THE PLACE IN THE WOOD,    
  NOW I'VE TOLD EVERYTHING?     

1448
01:27:47,125 --> 01:27:50,628
  WILL GOD OR ANYONE EVER       
  FORGIVE ME NOW I'VE TOLD?     

1449
01:27:53,766 --> 01:27:55,767
I FORGIVE YOU, HETTY.           

1450
01:27:58,570 --> 01:28:02,240
        AND FOR ALL I BEHAVED   
        SO WRONG TO YOU, ADAM?  

1451
01:28:03,709 --> 01:28:05,943
            AYE.                

1452
01:28:05,944 --> 01:28:08,479
I FORGAVE YOU LONG AGO.         

1453
01:28:11,783 --> 01:28:13,618
          ( sobbing )           

1454
01:28:13,619 --> 01:28:14,752
            KISS ME.            

1455
01:28:35,507 --> 01:28:39,076

          screeches )           

1456
01:28:44,884 --> 01:28:46,751

     OF THE EARTH.              

1504

    A RIGHT TO...               

1506
01:33:17,355 --> 01:33:19,123
    TO JUDGE                    
    BY THE TEARS                
    I'VE SPENT                  

1507
01:33:19,124 --> 01:33:20,625
    ON THAT                     
    POOR LASS SINCE.

     WELL ENOUGH.               

1523
01:34:14,847 --> 01:34:15,947
MOTHER OFTEN COMPLAINS          

1524
01:34:15,948 --> 01:34:17,782
    I LOOK AT NOTHING           
    NOR THINK OF NOTHING

1527
01:34:21,386 --> 01:34:23,020
     I'VE NO OTHER PICTURE      
     OF THE FUTURE

    VERY EARLY DAYS,            

1530

        I ALWAYS SAW            
        GOOD CARPENTRY          
        WAS GOD'S WILL.

      IT'S THAT PART            
      OF GOD'S WILL             
      THAT CONCERNS ME.         

1533
01:34:38,069 --> 01:34:41,572
  IT WAS ME FATHER,             
  TAUGHT ME ALL ME TRADE.       

1534
01:34:41,573 --> 01:34:43,975
I OFTEN                         
THINK OF HIM...                 

1535
01:34:43,976 --> 01:34:46,143
  WORKING HERE                  
  WHERE HE USED TO WORK.        

1536
01:34:48,413 --> 01:34:50,314
  I WAS ALWAYS                  
  TOO HARSH ON FATHER,          

1537
01:34:50,315 --> 01:34:51,782
     I RECKON.                  

1538
01:34:51,783 --> 01:34:54,251
( sighs )                       
IT'S IN ME NATURE.              

1539
01:34:59,057 --> 01:34:59,990
    DINAH...                    

1540
01:35:01,059 --> 01:35:02,727
    YOU'RE NOT                  
    DISPLEASED WITH ME          

1541
01:35:02,728 --> 01:35:04,595
    FOR ANYTHING,               
    ARE YOU?                    

1542
01:35:04,596 --> 01:35:06,496
                NO.             

1543
01:35:06,497 --> 01:35:08,098
             YOU MUSTN'T        
             THINK SO.          

1544
01:35:10,101 --> 01:35:11,635
     YOU MAYBE                  
     DON'T KNOW THE VALUE       

1545
01:35:11,636 --> 01:35:13,604
      I SET ON THE VERY         
      THOUGHT OF YOU.           

1546
01:35:13,605 --> 01:35:15,639
     BUT YOU KNOW WELL ENOUGH   
     WHAT CAUSE I HAVE          

1547
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:17,174
     TO PUT YOU ABOVE           
     ALL OTHER FRIENDS          

1548
01:35:17,175 --> 01:35:18,909
    IN THE WORLD.               

1549
01:35:18,910 --> 01:35:20,043
    AND YOU KNOW...             

1550
01:35:21,412 --> 01:35:23,280
    I DO MIND                   
    PARTING WITH YOU.           

1551
01:35:26,351 --> 01:35:28,185
BUT IF YOU THINK                
WELL TO GO,                     

1552
01:35:28,186 --> 01:35:29,920
I'VE NO RIGHT                   
TO HINDER YOU.                  

1553
01:35:33,658 --> 01:35:35,860
          I'M AFRAID            
          IF I STAYED ON HERE...

1554
01:35:37,228 --> 01:35:40,698
         I'D FORGET EVERYTHING  
         BUT ME OWN HAPPINESS.  

1555
01:35:43,034 --> 01:35:45,902
    BUT IF YOUR HAPPINESS       
    LIES HERE, DINAH,           

1556
01:35:45,903 --> 01:35:47,504
    WHY WILL YOU NOT STAY?      

1557
01:35:50,375 --> 01:35:52,910
         BECAUSE ALL THE PEACE  
         AND JOY I'VE EVER HAD  

1558
01:35:52,911 --> 01:35:55,780
         HAS COME FROM HAVING   
         NO LIFE OF ME OWN.     

1559
01:35:57,182 --> 01:35:58,516
            NO WANTS...         

1560
01:36:00,552 --> 01:36:02,953
             NO DESIRES         
             OF ME OWN.         

1561
01:36:06,024 --> 01:36:07,258
        I KNOW.                 

1562
01:36:08,793 --> 01:36:10,794
        I KNOW.                 

1563
01:36:10,795 --> 01:36:13,063
    YOU'RE NEVER EASY UNLESS    
    YOU'RE HELPING OTHERS.      

1564
01:36:14,332 --> 01:36:16,400
    NO ONE WHO KNOWS            
    AND LOVES YOU               

1565
01:36:16,401 --> 01:36:19,103
    WOULD ASK YOU TO GO         
    AGAINST YOUR OWN            
    CONSCIENCE, DINAH.          

1566
01:36:21,773 --> 01:36:23,074
             DON'T MIND ME.     

1567
01:36:24,676 --> 01:36:26,510
             I AM CALLED        
             TO GO BACK...      

1568
01:36:31,116 --> 01:36:32,783
        AND THE FLESH           
        IS WEAK.                

1569
01:36:44,762 --> 01:36:46,263
    GOODBYE, ADAM.              

1570
01:37:08,086 --> 01:37:09,619
  YOU MUST                      
  MAKE UP YOUR MIND             

1571
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:12,322
  TO DO WITHOUT HER,            
  MOTHER.                       

1572
01:37:12,323 --> 01:37:14,624
 IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN          
 THAT SHE'D HAVE                
 MARRIED SETH                   

1573
01:37:14,625 --> 01:37:16,726
 IT HAD BEEN A GREAT            
 BLESSING TO US,                

1574
01:37:16,727 --> 01:37:18,128
 BUT IT'S NO GOOD               
 CRYING OVER                    

1575
01:37:18,129 --> 01:37:19,363
 WHAT CAN NEVER BE.             

1576
01:37:21,066 --> 01:37:23,300
 DINAH'S                        
 NO FOR MARRYING.               

1577
01:37:23,301 --> 01:37:24,334
                      VERY LIKE.

1578
01:37:26,004 --> 01:37:27,571
        VERY LIKE               
        SHE'S NO FOR MARRYING   

1579
01:37:27,572 --> 01:37:29,906
WHEN THEM AS SHE'D BE WILLING   
TO MARRY WILL NOT ASK HER.      

1580
01:37:29,907 --> 01:37:31,575
        I SHOULDN'T HAVE        
        MARRIED YOUR FATHER     

1581
01:37:31,576 --> 01:37:33,177
             IF HE'D NEVER      
             ASKED ME.          

1582
01:37:33,178 --> 01:37:35,679
    SHE'S AS FOND OF THEE       

1583
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:37,581
         AS EVER I WAS          
         OF THIAS.              

1584
01:37:39,083 --> 01:37:40,718
MOTHER...                       

1585
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:43,253
  YOU ARE                       
  TALKING WILD!                 

1586
01:37:44,322 --> 01:37:46,290
WHAT'S BEEN SAID                
TO PUT SUCH IDEAS               

1587
01:37:46,291 --> 01:37:47,591
  IN THEE HEAD?                 

1588
01:37:47,592 --> 01:37:49,893
    IT'S NO MATTER              
    WHAT PUT IT IN ME HEAD.     

1589
01:37:49,894 --> 01:37:52,797
    ME HEAD'S NONE SO EMPTY     
    THAT SOMETHING CAN'T GET IN.

1590
01:37:52,798 --> 01:37:55,365
                 AND ONLY MEN   
                 HAVE TO WAIT   

1591
01:37:55,366 --> 01:37:56,500
                  'TIL FOLKS    
                  SAY THINGS    

1592
01:37:56,501 --> 01:37:58,335
                  AFORE THEY    
                  FIND THEM OUT.

1593
01:37:59,538 --> 01:38:01,705
            IT'S THEE'S
