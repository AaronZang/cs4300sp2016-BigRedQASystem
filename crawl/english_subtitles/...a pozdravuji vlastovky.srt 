I should set down my impressions
of the death cell.

13
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,479
I keep remembering...

14
00:02:40,764 --> 00:02:42,815
and feel only anguish,

15
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:44,872
loneliness.

16
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:47,835
and a longing for my loved ones.

17
00:02:49,014 --> 00:02:51,077
I would live
no differently today,

18
00:02:51,217 --> 00:02:53,102
except for the mistakes

19
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:54,881
that I have made.

20
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:17,901
Silence!

21
00:03:20,987 --> 00:03:21,672
Turn!

22
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:25,312
What?

23
00:03:25,532 --> 00:03:27,503
Keep the right intervals!

24
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:36,889
Cell number 62
with one prisoner.

25
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,798
You will continue painting eyes.

26
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:23,993
Daddy...

27
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,743
Maroushka!

28
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:29,886
Daddy, give me a ride...

29
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:33,989
In vain does the thunder roar

30
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,753
And he'll spit fire

31
00:04:44,155 --> 00:04:45,848
You'll bring the house down.

32
00:05:19,746 --> 00:05:21,482
They said 99.

33
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,473
99 days of life.

34
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,837
Hold out Wanda,
you'll get a pardon.

35
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:31,463
I'm repelled by Wanda's humbleness.

36
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,701
I felt dreadful when I found

37
00:05:33,808 --> 00:05:36,251
how I can barely stand her look,

38
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:37,666
and smile.

39
00:05:38,577 --> 00:05:40,077
I feel ashamed.

40
00:06:03,521 --> 00:06:06,243
I, too,
have 99 days of life left.

41
00:06:06,661 --> 00:06:09,811
which I hear they let pass
from the sentence to the execution.

42
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:13,432
Ninety nine days.

43
00:06:18,653 --> 00:06:20,753
I look forward
to seeing my loved ones

44
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:22,017
When will they come?

45
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:25,553
I want to forget I'm waiting.

46
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:28,896
One should never quite
count on anything nice.

47
00:06:29,175 --> 00:06:31,360
What if it didn't happen?

48
00:06:52,796 --> 00:06:54,296
Dear Mummy

49
00:06:56,608 --> 00:06:57,958
I'm lucky.

50
00:06:58,858 --> 00:07:01,022
My task for the German Reich

51
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:03,808
is painting eyes on tin soldiers.

52
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:06,640
That means I can write
and nobody knows.

53
00:07:15,575 --> 00:07:19,839
You must love me.
You must do as I say.

54
00:07:20,118 --> 00:07:22,839
Only me, remember!

55
00:07:23,557 --> 00:07:24,628
....

56
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:41,461
Good day.

57
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:44,633
Good day to you.

58
00:07:45,397 --> 00:07:47,197
How beautiful it is.

59
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:50,218
Beautiful it is,
but we don't see the beauty.

60
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:51,675
Goodbye.

61
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:53,299
Goodbye.

62
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,819
....

63
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:23,205
Germany, Italy,
France and Britain

64
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:26,655
made an agreement in Munich

65
00:08:26,783 --> 00:08:28,733
on annexing Sudeten-German territory
of our Republic.

66
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:32,465
the Government of the
Czechoslovak Republic

67
00:08:32,615 --> 00:08:36,965
has accepted the Munich decree.

68
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:40,828
....

69
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:45,693
aware that the nation
must be preserved

70
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:49,427
and that there is no alternative.

71
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,391
Even nature feels sick from the sun,

72
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:55,920
and vomits shadows.

73
00:08:56,134 --> 00:08:58,941
France, once eternal

74
00:08:59,198 --> 00:09:01,213
buries all action.

75
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:06,372
But the will for liberty is here

76
00:09:07,315 --> 00:09:13,079
And those are valid shackles.

77
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:16,594
And no one need think

78
00:09:17,151 --> 00:09:20,285
that this proud land

79
00:09:20,906 --> 00:09:24,570
will become a dog's skin

80
00:09:24,943 --> 00:09:26,957
or one for the bagpipes.

81
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,314
... the following Presidential orders:

82
00:09:43,913 --> 00:09:48,734
The German army is
beginning its occupation.

83
00:09:49,014 --> 00:09:51,628
of Bohemia and Moravia.

84
00:09:52,914 --> 00:09:55,399
Today March 15th

85
00:09:55,506 --> 00:09:58,592
all military garrisons
will lay down arms.

86
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,789
We'll chase them out!

87
00:10:37,748 --> 00:10:39,184
You want to chase them out.

88
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:05,263
- You have no scissors?
- No, what for?

89
00:11:05,596 --> 00:11:10,117
No sharp objects
may remain in the cell overnight.

90
00:11:15,522 --> 00:11:17,022
Understand?

91
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:19,208
Good night.

92
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:52,629
If you're lying you are only
making things more difficult for yourself.

93
00:11:55,136 --> 00:11:57,557
The Commissioner
expressed his pleasure

94
00:11:58,543 --> 00:11:59,893
at seeing you

95
00:12:00,793 --> 00:12:03,129
on the grounds
of the Law School.

96
00:12:04,794 --> 00:12:06,659
Former Law School...

97
00:12:10,194 --> 00:12:12,380
Come on, come on.
Talk!

98
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,041
Speak up.

99
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:17,699
....

100
00:12:18,513 --> 00:12:19,991
We know everything.

101
00:12:21,037 --> 00:12:23,415
If you know, why ask?

102
00:12:25,987 --> 00:12:27,465
I'm sorry.

103
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,878
With whom were you in contact?

104
00:12:31,071 --> 00:12:33,278
Do you belong to that Bolshie scum?

105
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:46,780
....

106
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:02,514
....

107
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:20,284
So you're prepared for everything,

108
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,315
should you fall into their hands?

109
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:29,772
Name?

110
00:13:30,062 --> 00:13:31,734
Don't pretend
you don't understand!

111
00:13:31,905 --> 00:13:33,298
Speak up!

112
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:35,912
Who gave you your instructions?

113
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:39,337
And it all passes away...

114
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:40,944
after December.

115
00:13:41,116 --> 00:13:44,309
The war goes on
and the prisons are full.

116
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,901
I was tried with Frieda.

117
00:13:48,672 --> 00:13:51,779
Even though I was sentenced to death

118
00:13:53,108 --> 00:13:55,208
and Frieda
only got a few weeks.

119
00:13:57,222 --> 00:13:59,429
And for nothing political I'm sure.

120
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:08,826
What are you writing
all the time, girl?

121
00:14:08,997 --> 00:14:11,697
- Nothing.
- Nothing, nothing, nothing.

122
00:14:15,512 --> 00:14:18,190
How?
You're writing all the time.

123
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,305
Just habit.

124
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:26,855
This book awakens
so many thoughts.

125
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:29,490
I have to write them down.

126
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:30,733
Really?

127
00:14:39,655 --> 00:14:43,213
Dear Frieda has
a nationalistic disposition.

128
00:14:44,337 --> 00:14:47,337
A cucumber also turns
into a gherkin when pickled.

129
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,637
And I'd hate to destroy
my scribbles because of her.

130
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:54,130
Even though I know
they aren't much good,

131
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:55,866
except maybe for those who knew me.

132
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:58,399
....

133
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:09,489
Cell number 62
with two convicts.

134
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,293
Come!

135
00:15:27,103 --> 00:15:28,603
It's Friday today.

136
00:15:29,032 --> 00:15:31,089
The day we have executions.

137
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:34,260
But only two weeks
have passed since the sentence.

138
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:37,116
And I was given 99 days to live.

139
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:07,080
Poor Frieda!

140
00:16:07,295 --> 00:16:09,652
She won't be able
to save me a dance.

141
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,985
That is Vitezka.

142
00:16:19,142 --> 00:16:22,292
They locked her up at 16, for treason.
This is her third year.

143
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:27,093
She denied it all.
Would you ever guess to look at her?

144
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:35,499
At sixteen?

145
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:42,421
Did they say
you're young and inexperienced?

146
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:44,499
They told you that too?

147
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:48,238
The Gestapo's more gallant.
They don't consider us inexperienced.

148
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,567
An unusual case from Brno.

149
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:10,578
A pig-headed liar.

150
00:17:13,878 --> 00:17:17,713
These here...
were pig-headed too.

151
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:22,901
But I got them to melt.

152
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:27,037
They're wiped out.

153
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:31,893
These are still waiting
to be liquidated.

154
00:17:35,064 --> 00:17:38,428
You're sure to have
some good friends amongst them.

155
00:17:41,283 --> 00:17:42,912
Do you know him?

156
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:45,869
I don't.

157
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:51,989
I'll help you remember.

158
00:18:16,385 --> 00:18:17,500
What is it?

159
00:18:33,582 --> 00:18:34,932
A light please.

160
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,705
I longed to look at him once more.

161
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:12,670
But I couldn't risk it.

162
00:19:14,018 --> 00:19:15,968
I never saw him again.

163
00:19:22,784 --> 00:19:24,948
Have you changed your mind?

164
00:19:27,948 --> 00:19:31,269
Are you going to talk?
You whore!

165
00:19:31,847 --> 00:19:33,239
Get out!

166
00:19:33,518 --> 00:19:34,739
Damn swine!

167
00:19:46,941 --> 00:19:48,869
You stood there
for three days and nights.

168
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:53,712
But it wasn't worth it,
boxing Friedrich's ears.

169
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:59,005
That was our merry Christmas of '41.

170
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,037
Hey! Get going!

171
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,815
And fast!

172
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:15,976
That's all.

173
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:18,119
Finish!

174
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,526
What's that supposed to mean?

175
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,840
....

176
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:58,277
Cold fell the dew that night

177
00:20:59,402 --> 00:21:04,395
....

178
00:21:04,483 --> 00:21:08,983
....

179
00:21:09,698 --> 00:21:19,452
....

180
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:26,759
How cold is your love, my dear

181
00:21:28,131 --> 00:21:30,681
Pretty girls.

182
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:34,516
What about a bit of fun, girls.

183
00:21:35,914 --> 00:21:38,293
We're on duty.

184
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,200
Exactly.

185
00:21:41,786 --> 00:21:44,550
Girls!
Girls!

186
00:21:45,257 --> 00:21:46,693
Come back!

187
00:21:50,401 --> 00:21:53,080
Prohibited zone!

188
00:21:53,315 --> 00:21:54,751
Come here.

189
00:22:55,234 --> 00:22:56,562
Teacher...

190
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:15,194
Will you do something for me?
But it's dangerous.

191
00:23:16,652 --> 00:23:21,173
You have a pass for Slovakia.
You could take a parcel over.

192
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,506
But, see they don't catch you.

193
00:23:24,763 --> 00:23:26,092
They won't.

194
00:23:40,495 --> 00:23:44,352
Would you dare bring someone through
the woods? Do you know the paths?

195
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:45,402
Yes.

196
00:23:45,766 --> 00:23:48,552
This is a serious business.
I wouldn't be cross if you...

197
00:23:48,863 --> 00:23:50,620
But, I'm not afraid.

198
00:23:52,592 --> 00:23:53,985
I knew that.

199
00:23:54,135 --> 00:23:56,578
Not a word to anyone.
Not a word.

200
00:23:58,876 --> 00:24:01,918
Tomorrow at the station, then.

201
00:24:34,035 --> 00:24:35,770
Are you looking for a room?

202
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:37,806
Yes,
I'd like to spend the night.

203
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:40,078
There'll be something in the village.

204
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:01,905
It's a good thing they're here.

205
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,979
Where have you been?

206
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,797
Goodness, you frightened me.

207
00:26:01,204 --> 00:26:02,747
Who was it?

208
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,140
You're jealous?

209
00:26:08,698 --> 00:26:10,048
I can't tell you who it was...

210
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,449
I don't know.
I've never seen him before.

211
00:26:15,577 --> 00:26:17,506
You brought him
over the border?

212
00:26:22,515 --> 00:26:24,487
Why didn't you tell me?

213
00:26:25,044 --> 00:26:26,608
Don't you trust me?

214
00:26:28,001 --> 00:26:30,037
You're giving this up at once!
Promise!

215
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:34,236
It's you who keep saying
we have to fight.

216
00:26:34,857 --> 00:26:36,829
So why hold me back?

217
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,356
I love you.

218
00:26:47,735 --> 00:26:50,735
The time isn't right yet.
They're too strong.

219
00:26:51,056 --> 00:26:53,778
- And you're so little.
- I'm not alone!

220
00:26:57,377 --> 00:26:59,885
And your mother?
Does she know?

221
00:27:00,335 --> 00:27:02,670
You could at least think of her,
if not yourself

222
00:27:02,735 --> 00:27:03,935
and me...

223
00:27:04,042 --> 00:27:05,220
What if they catch you?

224
00:27:05,327 --> 00:27:06,999
Then, they'll catch me!

225
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,789
Don't ask me anything!

226
00:27:22,006 --> 00:27:25,135
Dear God,
what will become of you.

227
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,959
Maroushka, are you asleep?

228
00:27:40,138 --> 00:27:42,581
Have you ever been in love?

229
00:27:46,717 --> 00:27:49,395
Well, I'm not sorry.

230
00:27:49,995 --> 00:27:52,438
That I slept with him.

231
00:27:55,513 --> 00:27:57,591
....

232
00:27:58,641 --> 00:28:02,241
With the Frenchman,
from the camp.

233
00:28:04,894 --> 00:28:08,023
Such a lover, so tender.

234
00:28:12,265 --> 00:28:14,515
It's impossible to describe, dear.

235
00:28:14,665 --> 00:28:16,658
Believe me.

236
00:28:20,068 --> 00:28:23,968
Our soldiers are courageous.

237
00:28:24,942 --> 00:28:26,999
But in bed...

238
00:28:28,242 --> 00:28:29,892
they are...

239
00:28:30,428 --> 00:28:32,185
Just like pigs.

240
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,266
Keep your courage up...

241
00:29:10,087 --> 00:29:13,173
Like an illiterate,
but an educated one.

242
00:29:18,751 --> 00:29:20,858
Quick.

243
00:29:22,223 --> 00:29:23,444
The paint!

244
00:29:27,647 --> 00:29:29,190
Hurry!

245
00:29:29,983 --> 00:29:31,333
Who is it?

246
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:35,404
What do you want?

247
00:29:35,512 --> 00:29:38,469
Sorry, but
I can't meet where we said.

248
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,719
The Germans are there.

249
00:29:41,876 --> 00:29:43,397
Here you are.

250
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,869
And make sure
you aren't seen here again.

251
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,633
Don't worry.
I'll hand them out tomorrow.

252
00:30:08,344 --> 00:30:11,164
Cell number 62
with two convicts.

253
00:30:13,757 --> 00:30:15,343
From Berlin.

254
00:30:16,672 --> 00:30:19,414
My nice doctor...

255
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,729
You!

256
00:30:28,354 --> 00:30:32,682
Maroushka
Please do as I ask.

257
00:30:33,411 --> 00:30:36,432
then I can live on in the faith

258
00:30:36,561 --> 00:30:39,582
that we will all meet in heaven.

259
00:30:40,235 --> 00:30:44,092
Your last words must be

260
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:47,304
I place my soul

261
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:51,954
into Thy hands, Oh Lord.

262
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:56,112
Bless you,
your mother.

263
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,125
That's prohibited.

264
00:31:54,652 --> 00:31:56,924
How are you Maroushka?

265
00:31:59,967 --> 00:32:02,774
They look after us very well,
as you can see.

266
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:10,765
Did you get my letter?

267
00:32:13,401 --> 00:32:16,229
I will die
if you don't do as I ask.

268
00:32:20,484 --> 00:32:22,777
You won't die, Mummy.

269
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:27,105
I can't,

270
00:32:27,855 --> 00:32:29,484
I really can't.

271
00:32:32,907 --> 00:32:34,685
Do understand...

272
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:36,721
Mummy.

273
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:45,639
Joseph, you plead with her.

274
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,283
I'm not going to church.

275
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:04,765
Plead?

276
00:33:07,336 --> 00:33:10,486
For the Germans
to give her the last sacrament?

277
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:22,338
- I nearly forgot, for Joey.
- That's not allowed.

278
00:33:26,915 --> 00:33:29,530
I have permission
from the wardens.

279
00:34:00,282 --> 00:34:01,654
What is it?

280
00:34:12,227 --> 00:34:13,855
Funny songs...

281
00:34:20,824 --> 00:34:23,609
Cell number 62 with two convicts.

282
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,423
You!

283
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,787
Take your things
and come with me!

284
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:58,202
Is it Friday today?

285
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,417
Halt!

286
00:36:00,524 --> 00:36:02,131
New orders.

287
00:36:02,817 --> 00:36:05,903
Jews with Jews,
Czechs with Czechs.

288
00:36:12,862 --> 00:36:14,790
Where are you from?

289
00:36:14,876 --> 00:36:16,419
From Straznice.

290
00:36:21,061 --> 00:36:23,483
That's where I used
to go to grammar school.

291
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:43,165
How hard the stone

292
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:48,394
To drift in the water

293
00:36:56,211 --> 00:36:58,632
Want to come out, Maroushka?

294
00:37:28,655 --> 00:37:32,041
Come on, get in.
It's late, we must be getting on.

295
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,231
Goodness, how old were you

296
00:37:50,232 --> 00:37:52,203
when they arrested you?
- Sixteen.

297
00:37:54,924 --> 00:37:57,196
This is my third year, here.

298
00:37:57,403 --> 00:37:59,738
One year in solitary.

299
00:38:00,188 --> 00:38:01,645
I was so scared.

300
00:38:14,744 --> 00:38:17,358
I'm so glad you're here with me.

301
00:38:19,778 --> 00:38:21,492
And I was scared...

302
00:38:24,985 --> 00:38:26,828
they were taking me to...

303
00:38:30,456 --> 00:38:31,806
Nothing!

304
00:38:33,927 --> 00:38:35,534
Do you know this one?

305
00:38:35,641 --> 00:38:40,677
Why dance so sadly

306
00:38:40,854 --> 00:38:45,482
My silk embroidered boots

307
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:50,617
....

308
00:38:50,832 --> 00:38:55,019
....

309
00:38:55,512 --> 00:39:01,769
....

310
00:39:01,931 --> 00:39:05,531
When the boy comes who loves me

311
00:39:05,938 --> 00:39:08,852
I have lived through
my death so many times

312
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:14,430
Suddenly anguish and death

313
00:39:15,866 --> 00:39:17,794
hold me

314
00:39:18,052 --> 00:39:20,066
in claws of horror.

315
00:39:21,514 --> 00:39:24,556
At such moments I try
not to think of my environment.

316
00:39:24,728 --> 00:39:27,556
I leave for my own world.

317
00:39:27,814 --> 00:39:29,399
I go...

318
00:39:29,914 --> 00:39:31,885
to my loved ones.

319
00:39:47,598 --> 00:39:50,898
I recognized you yesterday,
and you must have too.

320
00:39:51,198 --> 00:39:53,663
I asked about you.
You won't denounce me.

321
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:55,506
Do you like honey?

322
00:39:59,082 --> 00:40:01,160
We need your help.

323
00:40:02,768 --> 00:40:06,946
A radio transmitter,
and some arms...

324
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:09,432
- Our groups.
- My dear young lady,

325
00:40:10,289 --> 00:40:11,853
you are wrong.

326
00:40:13,654 --> 00:40:15,990
I'm not part
of an illegal movement.

327
00:40:16,633 --> 00:40:19,912
- And I was on that hike
for private reasons. - But...

328
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:24,840
And even if it were so,
d'you think I'd just nod and say yes?

329
00:40:28,966 --> 00:40:33,552
We'll get you
a transmitter and guns,

330
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:38,523
tell you
how many of us there are.

331
00:40:44,845 --> 00:40:47,224
My dear, aren't you a little bit...

332
00:40:47,909 --> 00:40:49,067
Naive?

333
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:53,557
I know who I'm talking to.

334
00:40:54,047 --> 00:40:55,461
You'll help us won't you?

335
00:40:55,847 --> 00:40:58,697
We print leaflets
and need some paper.

336
00:41:00,149 --> 00:41:02,271
And our groups could unite.

337
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,191
Alright. We'll help you.

338
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:12,591
Except for the linking up.

339
00:41:13,191 --> 00:41:15,912
- You can depend on us.
- I knew.

340
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,767
This is for you, from the bees.

341
00:41:18,982 --> 00:41:21,724
And next time be more careful.

342
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,317
I know.

343
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:28,286
We know you were forced into it.

344
00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:32,336
Who was it?

345
00:41:34,394 --> 00:41:35,765
Do you hear.

346
00:41:36,643 --> 00:41:39,407
Nothing will happen to you.

347
00:41:43,445 --> 00:41:45,652
....

348
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:49,487
The Commissioner
promised your mother.

349
00:41:51,038 --> 00:41:52,560
Of course...

350
00:41:53,396 --> 00:41:55,367
if you're sensible, that is.

351
00:41:56,588 --> 00:41:58,046
Know him?

352
00:42:04,361 --> 00:42:05,261
No.

353
00:42:17,177 --> 00:42:19,342
Won't you be ashamed of me?

354
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,477
The Bolshie hero!

355
00:42:39,813 --> 00:42:42,092
He passed his own sentence.

356
00:42:42,427 --> 00:42:45,770
It's over for him.
Jumped under a train, the hero.

357
00:42:53,925 --> 00:42:57,246
Pushed her into this mess,
and he...

358
00:43:02,025 --> 00:43:03,975
You don't know this one either?

359
00:43:23,242 --> 00:43:25,857
If you don't talk,.
somebody else will.

360
00:43:31,221 --> 00:43:34,500
....

361
00:43:53,354 --> 00:43:55,561
Who gave you the texts
for the leaflets?

362
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,523
Nobody.

363
00:44:03,738 --> 00:44:05,838
You didn't make them up yourself.

364
00:44:06,073 --> 00:44:08,409
I did.
Do you think that's difficult?

365
00:44:08,658 --> 00:44:10,437
Who gave you instructions for sabotage?

366
00:44:10,544 --> 00:44:12,944
I organized everything myself.

367
00:44:19,946 --> 00:44:21,167
Nonsense!

368
00:44:21,467 --> 00:44:23,053
- Who was it?
- Leave him alone!

369
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,078
- Surely you didn't all obey this slut?

370
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,996
- Leave him alone!

371
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,034
Cell number 2
with nine convicts.

372
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,350
Come...

373
00:45:08,286 --> 00:45:10,150
Mind out, girls.

374
00:45:11,007 --> 00:45:13,643
- Sit down.
- No, no thanks.

375
00:45:14,847 --> 00:45:16,882
What a fool I am.

376
00:45:17,311 --> 00:45:19,454
Quick, a towel! Water!

377
00:45:31,155 --> 00:45:32,698
Mummy...

378
00:45:45,632 --> 00:45:47,282
Well now...

379
00:45:48,096 --> 00:45:51,567
An educated girl like you,
working in our factory?

380
00:45:53,216 --> 00:45:56,387
I like it better here
than in an office.

381
00:45:56,945 --> 00:46:00,745
You thread the spools with the cotton.

382
00:46:00,895 --> 00:46:02,160
This is the warp.

383
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,467
And mind.
The spool can fall

384
00:46:07,074 --> 00:46:11,689
between the shuttles
and break the whole loom.

385
00:46:13,078 --> 00:46:15,670
Then what would the German soldier
use for bandages?

386
00:46:19,806 --> 00:46:21,435
I'll do my best.

387
00:46:24,106 --> 00:46:28,156
And should anything go wrong

388
00:46:28,242 --> 00:46:29,604
Annie will help you out.

389
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:32,475
This war-time stuff, you know.

390
00:46:49,187 --> 00:46:51,030
That's Lilli Marlene.

391
00:46:51,244 --> 00:46:55,283
She's in jail because
she gave the brave German soldiers VD.

392
00:46:58,969 --> 00:47:02,526
We each fight with our own weapon.

393
00:47:07,493 --> 00:47:10,236
Come here, girlies.

394
00:47:11,779 --> 00:47:13,493
You're so pretty.

395
00:47:14,286 --> 00:47:16,750
Come and sing for me.

396
00:47:17,372 --> 00:47:20,522
Come flying, white falcon

397
00:47:21,229 --> 00:47:24,379
Not that, a proper song.

398
00:47:24,904 --> 00:47:26,833
Do you know Butterfly of Night?

399
00:47:27,004 --> 00:47:32,361
I dreamed of love and love alone

400
00:47:32,637 --> 00:47:36,623
Of love my heart does sigh and moan

401
00:47:37,094 --> 00:47:39,366
The Butterfly of Night I see

402
00:47:43,911 --> 00:47:48,325
That means that love is lost for me

403
00:47:49,889 --> 00:47:53,061
Come on, dance for me.
More gracefully.

404
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:03,182
I'm so glad to see you.

405
00:51:05,412 --> 00:51:09,483
- What are you doing?
- Making bandages for German soldiers.

406
00:51:10,941 --> 00:51:13,041
Let me say hello to Daddy.
I've not been there for ages.

407
00:51:13,191 --> 00:51:16,041
No wait.
He's not on duty today.

408
00:51:16,705 --> 00:51:18,655
I'll take you home.

409
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:21,655
- I'll take that.
- No thanks, its light.

410
00:51:40,047 --> 00:51:42,854
How nice and kind they can be.

411
00:51:43,883 --> 00:51:45,661
Good people.

412
00:51:52,094 --> 00:51:55,008
- Are you working?
- How do you mean?

413
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:56,640
You know.

414
00:52:03,733 --> 00:52:06,433
Leave it alone, please.

415
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:10,693
It'll be your ruin,
and ours too.

416
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:15,064
- If you love me at all, promise.
- What am I to promise?

417
00:52:15,771 --> 00:52:17,400
That you'll stop.

418
00:52:21,308 --> 00:52:22,744
I love you.

419
00:52:25,916 --> 00:52:27,844
No! Let me go.

420
00:52:32,176 --> 00:52:34,512
I couldn't bear losing you.

421
00:52:37,191 --> 00:52:39,312
Let me go or I'll call the police.

422
00:53:09,256 --> 00:53:10,414
Air raid.

423
00:54:33,499 --> 00:54:35,085
When the war's over.

424
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:46,762
People are saying
we're dating anyway.

425
00:54:50,984 --> 00:54:52,998
That's the best alibi.

426
00:54:56,509 --> 00:54:57,709
When the war's over.

427
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:00,280
Hold the bike for me.

428
00:55:27,465 --> 00:55:31,001
DEATH TO FASCISM

429
00:56:02,396 --> 00:56:04,689
You're not coming to church?

430
00:56:05,525 --> 00:56:06,468
No.

431
00:56:08,487 --> 00:56:10,908
Prisoners sentenced to death
aren't allowed to.

432
00:56:11,111 --> 00:56:13,790
I'd only go to see the girls anyway.

433
00:56:14,724 --> 00:56:16,802
Don't you believe in God?

434
00:56:22,781 --> 00:56:24,152
Let's go.

435
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:58,422
There's too much talk about a girl

436
00:56:58,743 --> 00:57:01,443
out with men
at all hours of the night.

437
00:57:02,386 --> 00:57:05,951
- You should disappear for a while.
- I can't, I have to stay.

438
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,358
I'll be careful.

439
00:57:14,673 --> 00:57:17,009
Here's something for Polda.

440
00:57:25,971 --> 00:57:27,921
Come on, don't be silly.

441
00:58:17,516 --> 00:58:20,173
- What happened to you?
- Nothing.

442
00:58:24,266 --> 00:58:26,259
Fear's a terrible thing.

443
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:37,844
It is.

444
00:58:43,265 --> 00:58:46,139
That Sudeten-German got her pardon.

445
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:48,667
Here!

446
00:58:48,989 --> 00:58:51,389
The priest sends you this.

447
00:58:51,517 --> 00:58:52,782
To God.

448
00:58:53,489 --> 00:58:55,310
You told on me.

449
00:58:57,014 --> 00:58:58,749
I want to help you.

450
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:01,985
When one has faith...

451
00:59:03,718 --> 00:59:05,775
Really?
Not in God.

452
00:59:07,554 --> 00:59:09,375
In a people.

453
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:11,411
In all people.

454
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,237
....

455
00:59:15,893 --> 00:59:17,329
In Germans too?

456
00:59:19,815 --> 00:59:23,115
People can create
either paradise or hell on earth.

457
00:59:26,398 --> 00:59:28,563
What did the priest
whisper in your ear today?

458
00:59:28,691 --> 00:59:30,341
You mustn't say such things.

459
00:59:32,206 --> 00:59:35,141
Julie, I don't want
to take anything from you.

460
00:59:37,759 --> 00:59:41,530
When you get back among people,
you'll see for yourself.

461
00:59:45,473 --> 00:59:48,409
Aren't you afraid of death,
if you're not a believer?

462
00:59:51,966 --> 00:59:54,259
Aren't you afraid,
even though you are?

463
01:00:11,355 --> 01:00:13,926
I'm not afraid of that moment,

464
01:00:14,141 --> 01:00:16,583
that must be quite close by now.

465
01:00:18,041 --> 01:00:19,733
I know it's coming.

466
01:00:21,383 --> 01:00:23,355
I'm waiting quite calmly.

467
01:00:23,826 --> 01:00:25,712
I'm not afraid of eternity.

468
01:00:27,215 --> 01:00:30,172
I wanted only good...

469
01:00:31,051 --> 01:00:33,451
And to fight against evil.

470
01:00:51,165 --> 01:00:52,665
You've come.

471
01:00:55,279 --> 01:00:57,043
You'll be staying home now,
won't you?

472
01:00:57,150 --> 01:00:59,293
I wanted to see you before...

473
01:01:00,793 --> 01:01:02,507
I have to get back.

474
01:01:07,512 --> 01:01:09,162
What are you up to?

475
01:01:09,955 --> 01:01:13,084
- You must stop!
- I can't...

476
01:01:14,348 --> 01:01:15,334
Mummy.

477
01:01:15,462 --> 01:01:17,755
Please stay home, for God's sake.

478
01:01:18,977 --> 01:01:20,241
I can't!

479
01:01:20,948 --> 01:01:22,769
I won't let you go.

480
01:02:09,313 --> 01:02:11,841
- Cell number 61 with two...
- Right.

481
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:16,684
Everything alright?

482
01:02:19,224 --> 01:02:21,859
Did the package from Moravia arrive?

483
01:02:22,395 --> 01:02:23,574
Yes.

484
01:02:28,523 --> 01:02:30,901
The most highly paid
postman in the Reich.

485
01:02:31,094 --> 01:02:33,687
My mother sends her food parcels.

486
01:02:33,944 --> 01:02:37,309
- We're lucky to have her.
- And that she's so greedy

487
01:02:51,038 --> 01:02:52,902
I'm Jeschek.

488
01:02:53,052 --> 01:02:55,238
Your council for the defence.

489
01:02:58,877 --> 01:03:02,563
....

490
01:03:03,827 --> 01:03:06,784
You're surprised that I speak Czech?

491
01:03:07,063 --> 01:03:09,120
I studied in your country.

492
01:03:12,315 --> 01:03:14,372
This is a difficult task.

493
01:03:14,672 --> 01:03:17,157
You gave nobody away.

494
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:19,943
Took everything upon yourself.

495
01:03:20,377 --> 01:03:24,170
And then there's a special note.

496
01:03:29,484 --> 01:03:31,391
Unprecedented lying.

497
01:03:35,148 --> 01:03:37,226
Stubborn silence.

498
01:03:48,019 --> 01:03:50,312
I haven't had that before.

499
01:03:51,704 --> 01:03:53,954
Well, we shall see.

500
01:04:07,924 --> 01:04:12,360
... for high treason
and aiding and abetting the enemy.

501
01:04:12,831 --> 01:04:17,095
Will the plaintiff's council
please proceed.

502
01:04:21,788 --> 01:04:23,995
Most honoured judge,

503
01:04:24,595 --> 01:04:28,431
the proceedings have proved
the defendant guilty,

504
01:04:28,517 --> 01:04:30,702
beyond all reasonable doubt.

505
01:04:31,174 --> 01:04:34,260
The German nation
stands in fateful battle

506
01:04:34,431 --> 01:04:36,638
against Bolshevism.

507
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:40,688
And in this hour of need
the defendants

508
01:04:40,795 --> 01:04:43,495
tried to stick a knife
into the back

509
01:04:43,645 --> 01:04:46,881
of the fighting German soldier.

510
01:04:48,349 --> 01:04:50,320
....

511
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:56,041
Among the defendants
there is a woman...

512
01:04:56,612 --> 01:04:58,819
A young woman

513
01:04:59,205 --> 01:05:04,455
Should she also receive
the strictest of punishments?

514
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:08,065
My answer is yes!

515
01:05:08,922 --> 01:05:12,587
I therefore demand for all,

516
01:05:12,807 --> 01:05:16,536
the highest sentence,
the death sentence.

517
01:05:19,432 --> 01:05:22,346
I hurt nobody with a single word.

518
01:05:23,246 --> 01:05:27,489
What they said of each other
is their own affair.

519
01:05:28,909 --> 01:05:30,859
That's not on my conscience.

520
01:05:30,967 --> 01:05:32,831
For what they said about me...

521
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:36,045
I forgive them
with all my heart.

522
01:05:36,174 --> 01:05:38,981
I tried to have
all traces end with me.

523
01:05:43,438 --> 01:05:46,095
In the name of the German nation,

524
01:05:46,695 --> 01:05:51,431
the defendants are therefore
found guilty of high treason

525
01:05:51,718 --> 01:05:54,397
and aiding and abetting the enemy.

526
01:05:54,697 --> 01:05:58,489
and sentenced to death
and permanent loss of honour.

527
01:05:58,975 --> 01:06:03,303
The death sentence will therefore
be carried out after 99 days

528
01:06:03,432 --> 01:06:05,382
by beheading.

529
01:06:18,938 --> 01:06:20,545
Do you know what I dreamt?

530
01:06:20,697 --> 01:06:23,288
- That they granted you a pardon.
- Silly.

531
01:06:23,888 --> 01:06:26,760
Why not?
That Sudeten-German woman got one.

532
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:30,853
- Or at least a reprieve...
- You think?

533
01:06:31,964 --> 01:06:34,866
I know.
I'll ask the Head Warden.

534
01:06:37,323 --> 01:06:40,029
What's the good,

535
01:06:40,362 --> 01:06:44,637
when the pardon's refused
the sentence is carried out automatically.

536
01:06:45,049 --> 01:06:47,441
That's what they told me.

537
01:06:47,674 --> 01:06:51,752
They can't kill you.
I won't let them.

538
01:06:52,517 --> 01:06:55,105
They may not.
Don't worry.

539
01:06:56,752 --> 01:06:59,301
I know,
I'll take your place.

540
01:06:59,497 --> 01:07:02,713
Julie!
Let go!

541
01:07:04,698 --> 01:07:07,913
Julie, calm down!

542
01:07:10,074 --> 01:07:12,191
Julie...

543
01:07:12,858 --> 01:07:16,936
You're sweet,
but they wouldn't accept your offer.

544
01:07:17,093 --> 01:07:19,015
Neither would I.

545
01:07:21,564 --> 01:07:25,015
Look at me?
Am I a corpse?

546
01:07:27,172 --> 01:07:29,485
We'll go home together yet.

547
01:07:29,662 --> 01:07:32,564
You've only got
a few more weeks here.

548
01:07:34,918 --> 01:07:37,977
Now, let's sing something.

549
01:07:38,663 --> 01:07:42,310
You're handsome like a rose,
my lover

550
01:07:42,423 --> 01:07:45,600
....

551
01:07:45,796 --> 01:07:48,659
....

552
01:07:48,928 --> 01:07:52,026
....

553
01:07:52,149 --> 01:07:58,227
....

554
01:08:02,353 --> 01:08:04,432
Dear friend,

555
01:08:04,804 --> 01:08:07,275
I'll write that petition for clemency

556
01:08:07,485 --> 01:08:08,771
We'll out-lie them.

557
01:08:09,007 --> 01:08:11,492
How can we talk seriously with clowns.

558
01:08:12,844 --> 01:08:15,223
Vain sacrifices are stupid sacrifices.

559
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:57,232
- I went to Prague to plead on
your behalf. - What did they tell you?

560
01:08:57,683 --> 01:08:59,868
The answer comes from Berlin.

561
01:09:00,082 --> 01:09:01,732
I'd better go there.

562
01:09:02,032 --> 01:09:04,110
That's no good, Mummy.

563
01:09:04,303 --> 01:09:06,703
They wouldn't even speak to you.

564
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,050
Here's the Petition for Clemency.

565
01:09:12,178 --> 01:09:14,771
We sent it to the German People's Court.

566
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:18,285
to the Protector,
to Berlin and to Prague.

567
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:21,432
Excuse me please.

568
01:09:32,761 --> 01:09:35,247
Doctor Jashek
wrote it up well.

569
01:09:37,047 --> 01:09:39,083
But will it do any good?

570
01:09:41,654 --> 01:09:44,482
I sent in a Petition for Clemency too.

571
01:09:46,218 --> 01:09:49,223
But I don't believe
they're going to yield.

572
01:09:52,845 --> 01:09:54,666
The Russians are chasing them...

573
01:09:57,919 --> 01:09:59,441
Back at the front.

574
01:10:00,812 --> 01:10:03,469
We'll be celebrating together, yet.

575
01:10:04,776 --> 01:10:05,869
Julie!

576
01:10:13,002 --> 01:10:14,952
I'd like to talk to you some time,

577
01:10:15,102 --> 01:10:16,924
if you don't refuse.

578
01:10:20,959 --> 01:10:24,452
I don't think you'd
be pleased with the outcome.

579
01:10:29,552 --> 01:10:32,016
I shall pray for you, my child.

580
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,975
Good day.

581
01:10:44,595 --> 01:10:46,695
The Germans are retreating.

582
01:10:49,138 --> 01:10:51,195
Let go, you're throttling me.

583
01:10:52,142 --> 01:10:54,842
You see,
and you'll get your pardon too.

584
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,657
Oh, no.

585
01:11:02,364 --> 01:11:04,957
Now they'll be firm
and seek revenge.

586
01:11:09,843 --> 01:11:11,279
Dear girls...

587
01:11:12,029 --> 01:11:13,572
They're surrounded.

588
01:11:13,829 --> 01:11:14,857
Where?

589
01:11:15,629 --> 01:11:17,172
Do write!

590
01:11:18,425 --> 01:11:20,975
I know there's no chance
of pardon now.

591
01:11:22,797 --> 01:11:25,539
They'll judge strictly,
and ruthlessly.

592
01:11:26,954 --> 01:11:29,311
To avenge their fallen heroes.

593
01:11:32,161 --> 01:11:34,647
Whatever happens to me...

594
01:11:34,797 --> 01:11:36,511
don't be sad.

595
01:11:38,718 --> 01:11:40,539
There are many Maroushkas

596
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:42,489
and always will be.

597
01:11:43,089 --> 01:11:45,404
And victory is worth more.

598
01:11:46,882 --> 01:11:48,747
Because it costs more.

599
01:12:02,003 --> 01:12:03,696
Is Wanda ill?

600
01:13:20,886 --> 01:13:23,907
You must disappear.
They're after you.

601
01:13:25,043 --> 01:13:26,864
Get me some poison.

602
01:13:27,464 --> 01:13:29,007
Are you crazy?

603
01:13:29,843 --> 01:13:31,879
- Are you crazy?
- I'm not crazy.

604
01:13:31,986 --> 01:13:33,786
You must have a rest.

605
01:13:34,065 --> 01:13:35,800
We'll hide you, come.

606
01:13:36,165 --> 01:13:38,650
- I can't.
- You must.

607
01:14:30,935 --> 01:14:32,842
Will you come with me?

608
01:15:13,695 --> 01:15:15,066
Quickly

609
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:26,401
They gave me five years
and are sending me to Waldheim.

610
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:29,080
"Our warden"
let me visit you secretly.

611
01:15:29,508 --> 01:15:31,051
To say goodbye.

612
01:15:32,851 --> 01:15:35,294
Don't worry,
We'll see each other, yet.

613
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,737
Give me your hand.

614
01:15:38,251 --> 01:15:40,951
Really? You believe in this?

615
01:15:41,851 --> 01:15:44,534
Wanda went after
three months and five days.

616
01:15:45,091 --> 01:15:46,934
It's 14 days over my time.

617
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:49,870
Look, right down to here.
You'll get off.

618
01:15:51,134 --> 01:15:52,591
It says so here.

619
01:15:53,062 --> 01:15:55,805
When you say it
I nearly believe you.

620
01:15:58,838 --> 01:16:00,853
But it's better not to hope.

621
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:04,645
What if it came
and I was unprepared?

622
01:16:08,877 --> 01:16:10,591
I'll miss you.

623
01:16:13,913 --> 01:16:17,020
Don't worry,
when we meet again after the war.

624
01:16:17,191 --> 01:16:18,498
Don't worry.

625
01:16:18,691 --> 01:16:20,834
We'll really begin to live.

626
01:16:33,232 --> 01:16:34,925
Vitezka, dear,

627
01:16:35,525 --> 01:16:37,732
another Friday has passed.

628
01:16:38,332 --> 01:16:41,268
This tension increases
week by week.

629
01:16:41,739 --> 01:16:43,968
I always feel spent

630
01:16:44,332 --> 01:16:46,325
like after a long journey.

631
01:16:49,582 --> 01:16:53,139
Please send me "Mother Hope"
if you possibly can.

632
01:16:54,281 --> 01:16:56,295
I'll return it within a week.

633
01:16:56,510 --> 01:16:58,953
In case next Friday, I should...

634
01:17:00,474 --> 01:17:01,974
Forgive me.

635
01:17:02,424 --> 01:17:06,281
I'm tired after this Friday's chore
and uncertainty of waiting.

636
01:17:06,774 --> 01:17:09,581
I sang all our songs today.

637
01:17:10,803 --> 01:17:13,460
Better with a song than with tears.

638
01:17:16,891 --> 01:17:19,613
What a lovely scent.
Come and smell.

639
01:17:21,091 --> 01:17:23,770
They've put out a flag over there.

640
01:17:25,206 --> 01:17:27,160
For the first day of Spring, I suppose.

641
01:17:27,331 --> 01:17:28,831
Write about that.

642
01:17:29,537 --> 01:17:32,131
That's inspiration
to make one vomit.

643
01:17:38,742 --> 01:17:40,960
You!
You have a visitor.

644
01:17:54,406 --> 01:17:56,377
Your notes are out.

645
01:18:03,592 --> 01:18:06,635
Jarka's mother smuggled them out
on her last visit.

646
01:18:11,485 --> 01:18:14,313
And they must have given you a reprieve.

647
01:18:20,516 --> 01:18:22,744
This is the 124th day.

648
01:18:22,873 --> 01:18:24,994
I've lived through the 99 alright.

649
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:27,051
You see.

650
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:29,430
Have you heard from Jarka?

651
01:18:31,752 --> 01:18:34,516
We won't lose her,
not even there.

652
01:18:36,916 --> 01:18:38,502
We'll hold out.

653
01:18:38,802 --> 01:18:40,859
Till the last moment.

654
01:19:14,658 --> 01:19:17,508
Today I am twenty-two.

655
01:19:19,543 --> 01:19:21,601
I keep expecting a letter.

656
01:19:22,267 --> 01:19:23,595
Will you be coming...

657
01:19:24,603 --> 01:19:26,703
I look forward...

658
01:19:27,581 --> 01:19:28,974
to seeing you Mamma.

659
01:19:30,628 --> 01:19:32,964
And send my love
to the swallows...

660
01:19:33,521 --> 01:19:34,828
the bees...

661
01:19:34,893 --> 01:19:36,135
the trees...

662
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:40,476
What would you say

663
01:19:40,626 --> 01:19:43,369
were I to appear
in your midst?

664
01:19:44,756 --> 01:19:46,942
Can't you see, I'm there...

665
01:19:49,021 --> 01:19:50,885
Will you be coming?

666
01:20:22,491 --> 01:20:25,427
The blackbird and his mate

667
01:20:25,941 --> 01:20:28,727
Sang about their evening date

668
01:20:29,134 --> 01:20:32,584
That he'd come in a dress suit

669
01:20:32,751 --> 01:20:35,558
With a rain worm to woo her

670
01:20:35,944 --> 01:20:38,880
When two are in love, they're blind

671
01:20:40,808 --> 01:20:43,358
....

672
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:55,888
Yes, you...

673
01:20:59,338 --> 01:21:01,652
Dress and come with me.

674
01:21:04,133 --> 01:21:06,790
The attorney wants to talk to you.

675
01:21:32,738 --> 01:21:34,838
This means the execution.

676
01:21:57,562 --> 01:21:59,062
My dear ones...

677
01:22:00,348 --> 01:22:02,007
I'm saying goodbye,

678
01:22:03,743 --> 01:22:05,029
Sending...

679
01:22:05,865 --> 01:22:07,215
my love.

680
01:22:08,522 --> 01:22:10,279
Don't cry.

681
01:22:10,407 --> 01:22:11,993
I'm not crying.

682
01:22:12,957 --> 01:22:16,000
I'm departing,
without fear,

683
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:18,336
without pain.

684
01:22:19,429 --> 01:22:23,479
I'm now approaching that
which should have come at the end,

685
01:22:24,057 --> 01:22:25,621
and not in the middle.

686
01:22:26,221 --> 01:22:28,257
I'm leaving you and yet

687
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:30,893
I will be absolutely close...

688
01:22:31,289 --> 01:22:32,554
United.

689
01:22:35,406 --> 01:22:38,599
Your Petition for Clemency
was denied.

690
01:22:38,856 --> 01:22:41,470
the sentence will be
carried out tonight at 6.30.

691
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:44,192
There are nine of you

692
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:47,406
and the order
has  not yet been set.

693
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:50,834
The intervals will be two minutes.

694
01:22:53,149 --> 01:22:55,592
Will you please tell me...

695
01:22:56,774 --> 01:22:59,046
can my family fetch my ashes?

696
01:22:59,174 --> 01:23:02,410
With your things
you can pack your hair,

697
01:23:02,710 --> 01:23:04,938
because that is to be cut.

698
01:23:05,174 --> 01:23:07,767
Your family will relieve them.

699
01:23:11,204 --> 01:23:12,661
Thank you.

700
01:23:44,016 --> 01:23:46,737
Tonight, at 6.30

701
01:23:47,316 --> 01:23:50,980
two days after having attained
22 years of age, I will breathe

702
01:23:51,313 --> 01:23:52,941
my last breath.

703
01:23:54,549 --> 01:23:57,163
And yet,
right up to the last moment...

704
01:23:57,763 --> 01:23:59,584
I'll live and have faith!

705
01:24:01,487 --> 01:24:04,915
I would like to take all your
pain and grief upon myself.

706
01:24:06,544 --> 01:24:09,137
I feel the strength
to carry it all for you,...

707
01:24:09,329 --> 01:24:11,515
The longing to take it with me.

708
01:24:13,009 --> 01:24:14,488
I kneel before you,

709
01:24:14,574 --> 01:24:16,674
loved ones of my life...

710
01:24:16,866 --> 01:24:18,366
and ask for your love,

711
01:24:18,538 --> 01:24:20,166
and forgiveness.

712
01:24:51,798 --> 01:24:53,855
Have no fear for me.

713
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:56,769
Do not cry.
Do not despair.

714
01:25:23,684 --> 01:25:26,341
Everything... is silent.

715
01:25:27,369 --> 01:25:30,198
The decisive moment has come.

716
01:25:31,565 --> 01:25:34,329
I am with you.
Can you feel it?

717
01:25:35,717 --> 01:25:37,046
I'm filled with love,

718
01:25:37,324 --> 01:25:39,874
and am leaving in firm faith.

719
01:25:40,753 --> 01:25:42,596
My love to all.

720
01:25:43,174 --> 01:25:44,633
Forgive me.

721
01:26:05,429 --> 01:26:07,807
I tied up my hair myself.

722
01:26:08,193 --> 01:26:10,207
With it I send my message,

723
01:26:10,293 --> 01:26:11,772
And my kiss.

724
01:26:51,247 --> 01:26:54,290
