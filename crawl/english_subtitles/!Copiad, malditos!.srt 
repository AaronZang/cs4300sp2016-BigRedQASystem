00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:18,995
(The subtitles start with the
documentary in the third minute)

3
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,350
Copying is the opposite of creating.

4
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,590
Copying equals multiplying,
and multiplying is good.

5
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,190
Copying means having no imagination.

6
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,670
To me, copying
is the genesis of creation.

7
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,430
My name is Hassan,
I come from Lebanon.

8
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,110
I have lived here since 1993.
I am married with two children.

9
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,950
I started my business just like anyone else.

10
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,950
And suddenly I receive a letter from the SGAE,
the royalty collecting society.

11
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:34,590
"The SGAE has verified
that you have been using music by SGAE members

12
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:43,590
for entertainment purposes in your premises."

13
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,470
What can I say?

14
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,350
I've never received a visit from the SGAE.
I'll show you what I have here.

15
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,670
The biggest space is the kitchen.

16
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:13,110
There are only 25 square feet
for customers.

17
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:19,310
It's take-away only.
We have no sound system.

18
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:24,950
I only have a small domestic CD Player...

19
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:30,990
It's in the kitchen, and the only music
I play here is Lebanese music.

20
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,430
I get all the music from Lebanon.

21
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,750
Whenever I travel there
or somebody visits

22
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,390
they bring it for me,
or I buy it or record it.

23
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,150
It's always Lebanese music.

24
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:21,310
Copyright, or the right to copy

25
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,870
The situation in this Spanish town

26
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,910
shows that Intellectual Property
is present in our daily lives.

27
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,230
On the blog that accompanies this film

28
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:43,150
we will describe the production process
and upload the full interviews.

29
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,030
We want to experience these issues,

30
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,670
so we will try to licence the film
with a non-copyright licence

31
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,030
that allows us to put the video online

32
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,350
so that anybody
can watch, download and copy it.

33
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,550
The film will show
our attempts to do this.

34
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,790
Let's see if we manage.

35
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:15,310
Back to Montijo, the town that is
leading the fight against the SGAE.

36
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,190
The small business association ADEMYC

37
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,670
gives restaurant and bar owners
information and tools to defend themselves.

38
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,750
This is our new poster.

39
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:30,710
When someone picks it up,
we draw their attention to this part:

40
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,230
"The sound system is owned
by the company for private purposes,

41
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,430
and the public
does not pay for its use".

42
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,630
That way the SGAE can't make claims.

43
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,790
Mario is part of ADEMYC.
He works as a chef in his own restaurant.

44
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:50,910
After being attacked by the SGAE
he created the "Montijo Manifesto",

45
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,390
which explains how
to break free from the SGAE,

46
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,190
becoming a landmark
of the anti-SGAE struggle.

47
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,350
...using SGAE repertory,
in the town of Valdelacalzada...

48
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:21,110
ADEMYC is a non-profit association,
just like the SGAE claims it is.

49
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:28,550
We provide advice and information
to people who request this service.

50
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,670
The SGAE lobbied
to change the law to suit them.

51
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:39,710
New laws have been passed
just for the benefit of this group.

52
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,790
But not for all authors,
just for a privileged group of SGAE members.

53
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,430
We bar owners are
in a difficult situation.

54
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,950
If we don't want to pay the SGAE
we have to be prepared to fight.

55
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,470
All over Spain, business
and educational institutions

56
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,270
are starting to question their payments
to royalties societies.

57
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,550
Everyone in Montijo
is aware of the issue

58
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,110
and the Town Council voted
to stop paying the SGAE.

59
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,710
I hope that other town councils
stop paying the SGAE, like us.

60
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,990
What can the SGAE do?
Sue every town in Spain?

61
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,990
I can't see that happening.

62
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,870
We want to provoke discussion
and force changes in the law.

63
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,750
And this sometimes
requires drastic measures.

64
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,710
Everybody has heard of the SGAE,

65
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,830
and is familiar with the digital levy,
royalties collections and copyright.

66
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,270
But what is Intellectual Property (IP)?

67
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:56,350
Intellectual Property is the set of rights
that protect of human creations.

68
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,830
There are 2 types:

69
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,870
Industrial Property
protects brands and patents,

70
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:07,350
and Copyright protects artistic creations,
which is what concerns us here.

71
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:15,150
In Spain, IP law covers all original
literary, artistic or scientific creations,

72
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:21,190
such as books, plays,
translations, original music,

73
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,390
films,

74
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,630
paintings, photos, sculpture,

75
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,430
architectural and engineering designs

76
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,790
and software programs.

77
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,550
There are two types of legal rights:

78
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,830
moral rights
- which always belong to the author

79
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,110
and protect authorship
and the integrity of the work-

80
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,190
and exploitation rights
- which are transferable,

81
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,710
such as the right
to reproduction or dissemination.

82
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,230
The law sets the duration
of exploitation rights:

83
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,030
this is known as copyright.

84
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:06,310
Now, a work is copyrighted
until 70 years after an author's death.

85
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,430
Then enters public domain.

86
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,710
But why this system, why this duration?

87
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:19,230
Long ago, nobody owned culture,
but it was locked up in monasteries.

88
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:24,190
With the invention of the printing press
in 1439 everything changed:

89
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,790
culture began to circulate.

90
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:36,510
The 1710 Anne Statute
was the first Intellectual Property law.

91
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:42,310
It recognised the author's exploitation rights,
but also defended public interests,

92
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:46,390
ensuring works
eventually entered the public domain.

93
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,870
Copyright spanned 14 years
with the possibility for 14 more.

94
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:58,950
Since then, technology has been making it
faster and easier to copy and spread culture.

95
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,110
Copyright duration has increased in leaps:

96
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,750
1710: 28 years

97
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,630
1831: 42 years

98
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,630
1909: 56 years

99
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:16,030
1976: author's lifetime + 50 years.

100
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,510
This brings us to 1998

101
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:26,990
and the most recent leap:
the author's lifetime + 70 years.

102
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,270
Coincidentally,
this extension took place

103
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:35,030
just when a famous US mouse
was about to enter the public domain...

104
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:39,710
together with the thousands
of millions of dollars generated by his image.

105
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:54,230
To find out what types of licenses exist,
we go to Barcelona to see Ignasi Labastida,

106
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,550
professor and Spanish representative
of Creative Commons,

107
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,670
one of the world's
best known licensing systems.

108
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,150
He will help us choose
the right license for our film.

109
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:12,390
We've come to you for advice
on how to put our documentary online

110
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,350
so that everybody can download and copy it.

111
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,030
We'd like to know
what licensing options we have.

112
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:25,550
OK, there are many licenses,
but if we focus on Creative Commons (CC)

113
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,950
you should know that
there are 6 CC licenses

114
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:36,030
and all of them allow copying,
distribution and public broadcast,

115
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,590
for non-commercial purposes.

116
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:45,470
If you use a CC license,
you authorize these uses of your film.

117
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,070
You also have to decide
if you authorise modification.

118
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:55,190
That means allowing people to use parts
of your work to make their own film.

119
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,030
This is legally called "derivative work".

120
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,750
So you have six options.

121
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,950
From the most restrictive license

122
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,510
- no commercial use
and no derivative works-

123
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:13,230
to the most open, which allows
commercial use and derivative works.

124
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,950
CC seems like the right path.

125
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:23,430
To find out which license to use
and the whole process

126
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,270
we go to see IP lawyer
Javier de la Cueva back in Madrid.

127
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,670
We met Ignasi Labastida from CC,

128
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,830
who explained the different
alternative licenses...

129
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:41,150
- Why do you call them "alternative"?
- You're right!

130
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,470
I mean other licenses
more unusual than copyright...

131
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:52,390
We want our film to be
freely accessible on the internet.

132
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,710
OK, let's see...

133
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,790
I've reviewed your contract
with the TV station that co-produces, and...

134
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:07,590
I'll try to explain the procedures.
Let me draw it instead...

135
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,510
This will make it clearer.

136
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,750
We start from here.
That's the beginning.

137
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,590
The starting point
is the contract

138
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,830
between the production company
- that's you-

139
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,830
and the TV Station.

140
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,230
First we have to see if the contract

141
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,950
allows you to upload it to the Net.

142
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:41,830
You are not only filming,
you also have images, graphics,

143
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,430
interviews with people...

144
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,110
I guess you'll add music.

145
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,110
And there are also the rights
of the writer and the director...

146
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:55,270
and your rights as a production company...

147
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:04,830
Javier takes us through the legal
labyrinth of film production rights.

148
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:11,270
He talks about copyright and image rights,
co-productions and exploitation rights.

149
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,870
He explains everything we have to do
to put the film online:

150
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:23,190
we have to sign a rights transfer contract with
the scriptwriter, director, composer, designer...

151
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,990
It must specify that we will use a CC license.

152
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:35,110
If anybody belongs to the SGAE or similar,
we will need extra permits.

153
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:40,990
We also need to sign image release forms
with everyone who appears in the film.

154
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:47,990
Last but not least: we need an agreement
with TVE, the co-producers and co-owners.

155
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:56,550
This shows what we have to do
to release the film with a copyleft license

156
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:01,750
and put it online so anybody
can download and copy it.

157
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,270
If we end up at the SI (YES),
we're OK.

158
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:09,030
If we end up at NO,
we won't be able to put it online.

159
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,670
Then we'll have to come up with something.

160
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:20,630
With the Internet and digital copies,
file sharing has sky-rocketed.

161
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,750
Some sectors call it "piracy"-

162
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,590
In recent years, CD and DVD sales
have decreased substantially.

163
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,270
New forms of consumption are flourishing.

164
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,670
The music and film industries
are changing radically,

165
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:40,110
and with e-books, publishing
is heading for a revolution.

166
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,510
Film has been particularly
affected by "piracy".

167
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,510
It has no anti-copy
protection like software

168
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:55,790
and no alternative sales channels
like the music industry.

169
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:03,110
When you can download a movie for free,

170
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:08,710
that changes your perception
of the film's value.

171
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,830
Movies can't be free.

172
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,630
All of us who have worked
in the film industry

173
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:22,470
know that takes a great effort by many people
over a lot of months to make a movie.

174
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:31,110
In our company our aim is to turn cinemas
into digital entertainment centres.

175
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,150
So we can not only show movies,

176
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,350
but also documentaries,

177
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,270
live football,

178
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,270
operas...

179
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:49,030
The fact is that with the opportunities
offered by the Internet

180
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:54,230
less people go to the movies
and DVDs sales and rentals have gone down.

181
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,110
It's dramatic.

182
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:00,430
In the last 4 years,
sales have decreased by more than 50%.

183
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:09,310
Hopefully, cinemas will continue to exist,
but film exploitation will be mostly online.

184
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,750
Filmotech is one of Spain's
major film portals.

185
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,030
You can watch a film
on your computer for Û1-2.

186
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,830
The US is further ahead.

187
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:27,070
For $10 a month, NETFLIX offers
a full range of series and films

188
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,590
that you can watch on a TV
connected to the Net.

189
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:36,390
The NETFLIX catalogue is huge
compared to Spanish portals.

190
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,110
Film production has become very difficult.

191
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,870
The theatre and DVD sales model is outdated,

192
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,710
and online sales and rentals are embryonic.

193
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,870
We need new business models.

194
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,390
'The Cosmonaut' is a feature film project.

195
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,550
It's our dream.

196
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,750
It's the perfect story
to spend time working on.

197
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:30,910
It's our attempt to renovate and fix
some problems in the film industry

198
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:36,110
in terms of innovation in the financing,
shooting and distribution.

199
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:41,590
'The Cosmonaut' model
is based on audience participation,

200
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,590
creating loyalty from the start.

201
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:48,750
For a few Euros, you become
a producer, not just a viewer.

202
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:54,190
Extra funding comes from merchandising,
parties and sponsorship.

203
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,110
'The Cosmonaut' is using its brand value
as funding criteria,

204
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:04,950
to sell screening rights to TV and theatres
with guaranteed audiences,

205
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,870
as well as selling all kinds of by-products.

206
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,110
It's a transmedia project.
The core is the movie,

207
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:18,870
but there is also related content
like apps, a book, a video game,...

208
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:24,150
Our presence on the Internet
is essential for our business model.

209
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:31,190
The use of the Internet and some events
and parties we are making

210
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,310
allows us to reach people in advance.

211
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:39,950
They become co-producers
and this means we have an audience

212
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:45,790
that will go to the cinema,
watch it on TV, buy the DVD...

213
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:50,070
This is the good thing
about our 'producers'.

214
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:56,870
You can become a producer from 2 Euros,

215
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,350
by buying a welcome pack.

216
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:06,030
The minimum contribution is 2 Euros and you
get a personalized producer's certificate,

217
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:11,550
and a number for a draw in which
you can win an original cosmonaut suit.

218
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,470
You also get some stickers and a pin.

219
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,990
Alfonso is our musician.

220
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:35,150
In 10 years with us,
he has composed music for 8 or 9 films.

221
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:40,270
He agrees to put the film online,
and authorises us to use his music,

222
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:44,430
which will also be available online,
free for anybody to use.

223
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,070
I see this as natural too.

224
00:22:53,270 --> 00:23:01,550
If a commercial TV station uses my music,
they have to pay me royalties.

225
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:10,350
But I also think it's natural
to put your music on the Internet

226
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:16,870
so people can access it directly
without any middlemen like the SGAE.

227
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:24,710
As well as composing soundtracks,
he plays guitar live.

228
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:29,550
He plays in three bands: Desechos (rap),
WAKAME (Japanese pop)

229
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,230
and works with Mariem Hassan,
a Saharan singer.

230
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:40,510
Like most SGAE members, Alfonso is
a music worker, nothing like a big star.

231
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:47,790
We still don't know if Alfonso can legally
upload his music on the Net, copyright-free.

232
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:52,190
The SGAE could demand payment
from the website that hosts the files.

233
00:23:55,590 --> 00:24:01,110
Our co-production agreement with TVE
does not allow us to place the film on the Net.

234
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:06,270
We have proposed using a copyleft license
and sent them information about CC.

235
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,590
We are waiting for their reply.

236
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:14,790
Image rights shouldn't be a problem,
we will collect release forms when we shoot.

237
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:21,310
The director, writer, designer
and subtitler are OK.

238
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,030
Our musician is a SGAE member,
this may be a problem.

239
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,750
We have to talk to our lawyer.

240
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,790
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Stéphane, from the documentary.

241
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,510
- Hey, how are things?
- Good.

242
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:46,230
We have a problem with our composer,
he is a member of the SGAE

243
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:51,150
and we don't know if we can upload
his music under Creative Commons

244
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,790
or if we need a permit.

245
00:24:54,710 --> 00:25:01,390
OK, if he is a member of the SGAE
there is a problem.

246
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:07,270
When he joined the SGAE,
he gave them some management rights

247
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:15,870
for collecting royalties from TV
and radio stations, bars and so on...

248
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:22,190
However, the SGAE statutes set out
the possibility of a 'single-use authorization'.

249
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,910
I think I already mentioned it.

250
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:29,670
So he can request an exception
from the Board of Directors

251
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:35,950
so that particular piece of music
is not managed by the SGAE.

252
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,790
So he has to contact the SGAE
to find out the procedure.

253
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,790
OK, we'll talk to them.

254
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,710
OK, keep me posted.

255
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,710
- Bye.
- Bye.

256
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,550
We have to talk to the SGAE.

257
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:04,830
We call and visit, but nobody in the SGAE
Members Department can tell us what to do.

258
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:10,630
On our lawyer's advice, we make a formal
request, in line with the SGAE statutes.

259
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:20,030
It looks like we've hit the SGAE,

260
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,710
but how do royalties societies
like the SGAE work?

261
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:33,710
IP law makes collective
royalties management mandatory.

262
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:40,630
Authors must collect royalties
through an organisation, not individually.

263
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,910
In Spain, there are 8:

264
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:48,110
the largest, SGAE,
represents musicians and publishers.

265
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,510
Then there is CEDRO, writers;

266
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,870
AGEDI, music producers;

267
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,830
AIE, music performers;

268
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,710
AISGE, actors;

269
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,950
VEGAP, visual artists;

270
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:04,110
EGEDA, audiovisual producers;
and DAMA, film-makers.

271
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:08,990
They are all private and registered
as non-profit organisations.

272
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:15,230
Their purpose is to collect
royalties generated by their members.

273
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:23,870
Then they distribute the money, taking a cut
for admin costs, welfare and promotion.

274
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:28,310
IP law also recognises authors' rights

275
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:33,550
to compensation for private copies
through the 'digital levy'.

276
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:42,270
Royalties societies distribute the money
based on their own diffusion and use figures.

277
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:57,430
The SGAE is Spain's largest royalties society.

278
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:02,070
It has almost 100,000 members,
and collected 316 million Euros in 2009.

279
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:06,030
In recent years,
it has become the target of criticism,

280
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:10,710
and the arch-enemy
of net activists, net users

281
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:14,550
and even some institutions
that refuse to keep paying.

282
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:23,630
It is criticized for
its aggressive collection policies,

283
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:28,230
undemocratic nature and lack of transparency
in its distribution of funds.

284
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:41,350
In the 1980's, the SGAE was completely
restructured and expanded to include publishers.

285
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,590
Problem number 1:
it works like a vertical trade union.

286
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:49,110
We think authors should be managed
separately from publishers.

287
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:57,630
Problem number 2: in the 1800's
it was one person, one vote,

288
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:03,070
but today -and this is not
an exaggeration or propaganda-

289
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:08,470
only 7-10,000 members out of around 90,000
have the right to vote...

290
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:15,470
There are around 100,000 SGAE members
but not all make a living from their work.

291
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:20,190
So we work like big companies do:

292
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,510
the more shares you have,
the more votes you have.

293
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:29,670
Your number of shares (and votes)
is proportional to the money you make.

294
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:34,430
The reason the SGAE
is so conservative

295
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:40,830
and resists all changes and always tries
to stop technical advances

296
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:45,310
lies in the voting system.
It's obvious.

297
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:53,070
If those who can vote are making money
with this system, why would they change it?

298
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,750
Some authors can't vote

299
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:02,150
because they don't sell enough records.

300
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:09,750
They distribute the money they collect
in a totally arbitrary way,

301
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:13,990
essentially among the 10% who can vote.

302
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:22,070
1.75% of authors received
75% of the money from the royalties.

303
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:29,430
That's 1.75% of people
receiving 75% of the money.

304
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:35,270
People say we're not transparent...
Come on! What else can we do?

305
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:42,870
We can't publish all the earnings with names.

306
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:47,110
It's forbidden by Data Protection laws.

307
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,870
Simona is from eXgae,

308
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:56,190
a Barcelona group that helps people
break free from the SGAE.

309
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,990
They are joined
by many groups and activists

310
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:03,910
who believe IP
must be managed differently.

311
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:09,390
They work tirelessly to make the system
fairer and more transparent.

312
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,870
They want to redefine "culture",

313
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:16,590
which too often gets mixed up
with entertainment and commerce.

314
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:23,750
According to the law, only
collecting societies like the SGAE

315
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:29,310
are entitled to collect royalties
from TV stations and similar.

316
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:35,070
Then, in theory, this money
should be distributed among the authors...

317
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:39,870
The purpose of this performance
is to tell the cultural industry

318
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:45,430
that we will no longer pay the bill
if they refuse to restructure.

319
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,990
We'll be right here
for a while

320
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:58,910
bringing you updates from the Cultural
Industry Summit, taking place right over there...

321
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,990
We must defend our freedom.

322
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:08,630
You can't stop history,
you can't make a living from old privileges...

323
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:14,590
The entertainment and cultural industries

324
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:20,830
were based on selling
DVDs, CDs and TV Programs,

325
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:26,390
but now that's over...

326
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:35,110
As a clown, I cannot mention
any existing trademark in my shows.

327
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:43,670
For example, I can't do a sketch that
mentions brands like McDonald's or Apple...

328
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:54,350
because I would be taking the risk of being
sued for the use of registered trademarks.

329
00:32:54,550 --> 00:33:00,950
It's a paradox... I was able to do a show
dressed up as Pope Ratzinger

330
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:05,790
and make jokes about him freely

331
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:12,470
but I can't use
trademarks like McDonald's in a joke.

332
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:28,630
The judge who was there at the time...

333
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,590
Javier de la Cueva gives us legal advice.

334
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:37,110
He is a Madrid lawyer who defends people
or companies sued by royalties societies.

335
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:41,870
Together with David Bravo,
he has defended many 'links webs' and bars

336
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,910
sued by the SGAE
and other royalties societies.

337
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:50,830
Spain is world leader in court rulings
that recognize the rights to free culture.

338
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:56,230
We were among the first
to rule on copyleft in the world.

339
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:04,270
Our judges understood
what a 'hyperlink' is perfectly,

340
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:09,990
but our political powers
are blind to what society wants.

341
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:16,990
Javier runs a public archive
where he shares his knowledge on IP

342
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,510
and he publishes
all his progress and successes.

343
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:26,750
David Bravo and other lawyers contribute,
and share their experiences freely.

344
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,390
It is copyleft applied to law.

345
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,550
It's decentralized procedural law.

346
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,910
Concentrated knowledge
used to give power to a few.

347
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,430
Now it's more freely distributed,

348
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:42,310
and this collective intelligence
gives better results

349
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:48,470
than knowledge deposited
in only one person.

350
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:55,630
These lawyers also work on education.

351
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:00,790
They appear in the media,
universities and social centres,

352
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,430
explaining the way they see IP.

353
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:12,590
When we're asked to give a talk,
we always go.

354
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:16,750
Like here, in the University of Malaga.

355
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:21,470
People organize copyleft events
and we participate.

356
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:26,950
They want to share these ideas for free,
so we attend for free.

357
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:32,230
However, I charge when I'm asked
to give lectures at companies.

358
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,390
Javier and I make money
giving "concerts".

359
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:40,910
I also charge for giving seminars
or going to court cases.

360
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,670
But my "songs" are for free.

361
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,710
My texts are free on the Internet,

362
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:51,710
all my lectures are on YouTube...

363
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:57,030
I only charge when I leave this room
and give a "concert",

364
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,910
like musicians should...

365
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:08,750
We have all the image release forms
signed by participants.

366
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:16,430
Alfonso has requested a permit so that
the SGAE does not manage the music in the film,

367
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,830
and it can be put on the Net.

368
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,150
We are waiting to hear from them.

369
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:27,230
TVE authorizes us to use
a Creative Commons license.

370
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,590
I used to sell records...

371
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:37,750
In reasonable numbers...
I even sold cassette tapes.

372
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:40,150
My first release was on tape.

373
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:46,990
The distributor, another part of the system,
gets the CDs to the stores,

374
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:54,150
and in our case,
we get most of them back...

375
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:59,830
Yeah, maybe out of curiosity,
people download music...

376
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,670
What do I think?

377
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,310
That's the million-dollar question...

378
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:11,510
I think it is unstoppable

379
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:16,310
in the world we live in
and with all the available technology.

380
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:22,230
You can't tell millions of kids
aged from 12 to 16...

381
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,550
and much older...

382
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:29,390
You can't tell them that something
that they can get so easily,

383
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,270
with just a single click...
is forbidden.

384
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,950
For years, the music industry
has been in upheaval.

385
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,110
MP3 has gone universal

386
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:05,910
and broadband allows records
to be downloaded in seconds.

387
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:11,750
CD sales are plummeting
and many groups use the Net for publicity,

388
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,550
and even release their own records.

389
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,070
My office,

390
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,390
my Netlabel,
my record label.

391
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:34,750
All you need is a computer
and an internet connection.

392
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:39,670
I tidied up a little here...
Usually this is a mess.

393
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:42,350
These boxes are full of CDs.

394
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:46,830
They have to be handy
so I can post them.

395
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,430
You can see I have a few.

396
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:54,350
Everyone who runs a small record label
has a boxes under the bed,

397
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:58,390
at their parent's, in a cupboard...

398
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:03,670
You release CDs,
but you don't sell many.

399
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:08,550
That's all you need,
and a lot of hours of work.

400
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,510
I have my Netlabel website,

401
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:16,590
where I post info
about my bands: bios, news...

402
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:21,830
And then an online shop.
That takes up more time.

403
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:27,470
I also spend time uploading the music

404
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:31,910
to last.fm or archive.org...

405
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:37,230
wherever I think it will reach more people.

406
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:43,710
Netlabels exists to ensure that music
reaches as many people as possible

407
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:47,150
as affordably as possible
or ideally for free.

408
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:50,830
You can't see it as a business.

409
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:56,990
If bands want to make money,
they'll go to a multinational record company.

410
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:02,990
Big Record Labels still
use models from the past.

411
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:11,350
They work in a pre-internet way.
There are new rules now.

412
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:14,350
They're lagging behind.

413
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:20,070
Thanks to the Internet,
a single net label can do everything.

414
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:25,750
A traditional label needs
a distributor, shops...

415
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:32,990
and it also needs middlemen
to connect all links in the chain...

416
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,990
A Netlabel
does everything itself.

417
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:40,750
You don't need anyone,
just the musicians.

418
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:46,830
I try to stick to my principles.

419
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,590
And the bands know this.

420
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:53,870
If I like a band,
I tell them I want to release their music

421
00:40:54,110 --> 00:41:00,950
and I also tell them that I believe
in things like copyleft, self-management...

422
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:05,110
and working with minimum resources.

423
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,550
If that's OK with them, great!

424
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:11,510
I believe in a future where record labels
are more than just that.

425
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:17,070
It's not just about a new definition.
We need a new concept.

426
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:22,470
There's no point in having a company
that just produces and sells CDs.

427
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:27,030
Publishing is
on the brink of a revolution.

428
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:30,350
Some publishers
have been online for years.

429
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:33,150
Their texts can be downloaded for free.

430
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:36,390
Paradoxically,
this doesn't harm their business.

431
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:43,710
Traficantes de Sueños is a book store,
a publishing house, an alternative distributor...

432
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:47,550
a design studio
and a social centre.

433
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:51,630
We publish texts
we consider interesting

434
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:58,710
and position them in places
that will have a good reception.

435
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:06,710
From the moment Creative Commons Licenses
began, we found them very useful.

436
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:14,510
When we use these licenses, it makes sense
that the texts are available online.

437
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:22,830
Some people find it hard to understand
that on the same day a print book is released,

438
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:26,430
it's available for free download.

439
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:31,710
This is inherent to our belief in free culture.

440
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:37,550
And it also guarantees
a wider diffusion of our texts.

441
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:42,350
We're a small publisher.
We only release a few titles a year

442
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:49,230
but the impact of our texts
means that the books by some of our authors

443
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,750
are translated and they get
invited to conferences.

444
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:59,510
And this is all because their work
was made accessible online.

445
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:02,590
With books that are only in print,
this wouldn't happen.

446
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:10,710
The problem of book piracy
is not as serious as that of music piracy.

447
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:14,670
So there is no need to overreact.

448
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:24,590
The book industry has obviously undergone
radical changes since the arrival of the Net.

449
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:31,870
Our intention is to offer
our print catalogue as e-books.

450
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:39,670
No one is in a hurry
to demolish his own house

451
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:43,350
or to have less opportunities...

452
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:47,830
And certainly no one is in a hurry
to reduce their profits.

453
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:55,590
That's why publishing houses are dragging
their feet, trying to buy more time.

454
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:05,230
IP law is changing rapidly.

455
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:11,190
Laws lag behind technological advances,
and IP is growing in economic importance.

456
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:14,310
New forms of control are emerging.

457
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:18,190
Spain is reforming its IP laws.

458
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:21,550
The Sustainable Economy Law

459
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:26,030
allows websites to be shut down
for alleged infringement of IP law.

460
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:29,830
Controversially, no court order is required.

461
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:35,350
Legislation isn't up to date
with the current situation.

462
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:39,670
Lawmakers are responsible for this.

463
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:49,030
Lawmakers directly affect
the life-style and earnings of authors.

464
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:57,870
The new Spanish law restricts
constitutional rights like freedom of expression.

465
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:07,030
And it won't help reduce file sharing.

466
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:14,670
The only thing the industry can do
to stop illegal -free- copying

467
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:19,590
is to impose a police state
on the net, and thus on society too.

468
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:29,310
A blog reader sent us a video
which we think is worth sharing here.

469
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:32,350
Followers,
I'm 'Captain Copy'.

470
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:36,270
Culture Minister, do you recognize me?
I'm your worst nightmare!

471
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:40,350
I have millions of hard drives
downloading non-stop...

472
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:45,030
I'm better than Spotify, folks.
I have millions of songs.

473
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:46,270
Wait!

474
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:50,750
TV channels do it all the time,
but can we legally show this video?

475
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:54,510
Back to the lawyer!

476
00:45:55,430 --> 00:46:01,790
You have to ensure that the person
who sent you the video owns the rights

477
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:05,710
and can transfer them to you
so that you can use it in your film.

478
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:08,270
If not, I wouldn't advise you to use it.

479
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:15,070
Javier tells us about the right to quote,
as per article 32 of IP law,

480
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:21,110
allowing the use of material for education
and research without prior authorisation.

481
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:27,990
Ignoring the law, TV stations
use anything they find on the Net

482
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:32,630
just for entertainment,
not for education or research.

483
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:36,390
We found a video on Internet
that we're wild about.

484
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:42,030
It's a remix of a Spanish song,
"Paco, Paco, Paco"

485
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:44,870
with a video clip of Beyoncé.

486
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:49,030
It's crazy but it works!
Look!

487
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:10,670
It is now common to collect
and transform content found on the Net.

488
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:16,670
The young generation of digital natives
is used to watching, using, transforming,

489
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:22,590
and remixing anything they find online,
usually returning it back to the Net.

490
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:26,870
This is the case
of Pep, 14, from Catalonia.

491
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:30,710
I like creating and editing things.

492
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:36,350
Everything I edit,
like games and video clips,

493
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:44,230
I upload all of it
onto an account I have on the Internet.

494
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:09,990
I wanted to do a Jurassic Park Lego trailer.
So I analysed the original movie trailer.

495
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:17,070
I worked with 'I can animate', and took
the original soundtrack from the trailer.

496
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:22,030
And then just synched
my pictures with the original sound.

497
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:31,270
What about IP and copyright?

498
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:34,430
Pep says they don't teach
these things in school.

499
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:39,430
And he can explain why he uses
copyrighted material he finds on the Net.

500
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:44,430
I knew nothing about copyright at the time.

501
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:51,470
I didn't know that using
other people's work was illegal.

502
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:54,150
But I don't make money from this...

503
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:58,350
It's legal and illegal
at the same time...

504
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:04,070
It would be bad to use
this material to make money.

505
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:12,670
But I think I should be allowed to use it
if I don't make money.

506
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:21,190
The cultural industry must start understanding
people like Pep, its future clients.

507
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:28,030
It has to accept that Pep will never
buy music on CDs, or films on DVD.

508
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:39,070
Royalties Societies have designed
educational campaigns for young people

509
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:43,190
dealing with Intellectual Property...
the way they see it.

510
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:50,150
"Educate to Create" is a school program
designed by CEDRO and other institutions,

511
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:59,550
to introduce intellectual property material
on the school syllabus in an entertaining way.

512
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:06,350
The "Educate to Create" videos show
the kind of education they're giving...

513
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:10,030
In one of the videos the teacher asks:

514
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:14,550
"What do you think about private copy?"

515
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:20,070
One of the children gives the answer
they're looking for, I guess:

516
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,190
"It's terrible,
everything must be original"

517
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:27,030
"Do you think private copies are good?"

518
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,590
"No way, everything must be original"

519
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:34,990
Private copy
is a right guaranteed by law.

520
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:40,790
Unless this child was corrected
after giving this answer,

521
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:45,430
this means they are teaching kids
that it's wrong to exercise this right.

522
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:50,150
This shows us
the lack of ethics of these people.

523
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:58,430
They don't have any kind
of consideration for others.

524
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:03,390
They don't care...
They manipulate children, people, anybody...

525
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:07,990
Everything in their lives is about money.

526
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:09,990
It's all about their money...

527
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:14,430
What kind of society are we building
with these 'gentlemen' in charge?

528
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:21,670
I'm Captain Clone,
owner of everything.

529
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:25,030
You create something,
I take it.

530
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:31,390
You create a book, a video game,
a song, I'll steal it.

531
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:38,150
What he does is called piracy,
and it's a crime...

532
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:44,950
For 5000 years, children have been told
to copy handwriting to learn how to write,

533
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:47,990
and suddenly copying is bad?

534
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:52,270
It's unbelievable they way
these children are being used:

535
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:55,270
"I'm the bad pirate, I copy!"

536
00:51:55,470 --> 00:52:00,430
How can you learn to write
except by copying?

537
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:06,630
I'm cheaper!
Free if you download me from the Net!

538
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:09,070
Be original!

539
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:11,470
Be original!

540
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:16,150
Defend your rights
and respect those of others.

541
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:28,750
I always thought "culture"
was somehow linked to "commerce".

542
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:34,790
Cultural management, grants,
legislation, royalties societies

543
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:39,430
are all based on a commercial culture
that generates profit.

544
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:44,510
Often, cultural industries are
actually entertainment industries.

545
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:50,470
But most cultural producers work on
a "non-professional" or even altruistic basis.

546
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:55,590
How many writers live off book sales?
What about musicians?

547
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:20,110
The things people create in their homes,
on the streets, independently of companies...

548
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:27,670
they things they film with their cameras
and upload to YouTube...

549
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:30,750
this is also culture.

550
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:37,910
It helps to understand society,
the world and yourself.

551
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:41,630
Culture goes much further
than just the market.

552
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:44,630
But the industry
mixes them up

553
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:52,870
to suggest that if you attack the industry,
you're attacking culture.

554
00:53:53,590 --> 00:54:01,550
If this harms big corporations,
I'm very sorry jobs are being lost.

555
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:09,110
Many shipyards and mines have also closed
in Spain, with a great loss of jobs.

556
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:18,430
After months of phone calls, emails
and meetings with the SGAE press manager,

557
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:21,630
we have an appointment
with the Director of Members.

558
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:24,230
In spite of everything I've heard,

559
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:28,470
I might still consider joining the SGAE
as a writer and director.

560
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:33,670
We also have to find out if we can put
Alfonso's original score online.

561
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:41,350
You should join the SGAE
because of the many services we can offer.

562
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:45,070
The best known are financially related.

563
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:47,670
We'll pay you your royalties.

564
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:51,470
They haven't replied
to our written query,

565
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:56,470
so I ask if Alfonso can manage
the rights to his own music,

566
00:54:56,950 --> 00:55:01,950
without receiving a SGAE invoice
for downloads in a few months.

567
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:10,230
On behalf of the SGAE I can say it's fine.
We won't send you bills for downloads.

568
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:13,630
The SGAE gets a lot of bad press...

569
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:20,030
It seems easy now, but we spent four months
trying to get through to the department,

570
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,430
and nobody could give us an answer.

571
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:30,190
If you decide to waive royalties
for online exploitation

572
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:34,990
- because you have it on your own website
as a producer or director,

573
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:40,030
or on other websites
to increase its reach-

574
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:44,950
you're totally free to do that.

575
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:49,630
Everything has turned out OK.

576
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:53,470
TVE allows us to put the film online,

577
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:57,830
and we can use Alfonso's music
without worrying about the SGAE.

578
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:02,990
Now we have to decide if it's a good idea
- as a small production company-

579
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:06,670
to use a copyleft license,
or stick to copyright.

580
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:17,150
The SGAE doesn't offer me flexibility
for managing rights to my works

581
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:20,310
and it only recognises copyright licenses.

582
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:23,430
I don't like
their distribution policies

583
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:27,590
and I wouldn't be able
to attend meetings and have a voice.

584
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:33,190
I'm not very impressed by
the real estate operations they are involved in,

585
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:36,430
so I won't be joining the SGAE for now,

586
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:40,230
even if it means
missing out on my royalties.

587
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:45,430
This is by no means
the end of the industry.

588
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:49,350
It will change, but it won't go away.

589
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:54,670
Because people will still want
culture, movies, music...

590
00:56:55,150 --> 00:57:01,190
If it's impossible to make money
out of creating culture,

591
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:07,150
nobody will create culture

592
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:10,790
or artistic content.

593
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:16,350
Right now it seems that nobody
will be able to make money out of culture.

594
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:22,190
But I think we are transitioning
to a new model of business

595
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:28,430
and a new model of relations between
authors and consumers of information.

596
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:36,550
Internet is creating problems
like paedophilia, among other things...

597
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:40,590
New technology
is not necessarily good.

598
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:44,430
At some point,
we'll have to regulate it.

599
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:51,310
These corporations that systematically
infringe citizens' rights:

600
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:56,870
we have to send them bankrupt
so they can't afford to keep lobbying!

601
00:57:57,510 --> 00:58:03,470
There will be always music.
There is more music now than ever before.

602
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:10,190
Music will be around for a long, long time...

603
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:14,950
We've almost done it!

604
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:18,750
TVE agrees to let us use a CC license

605
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:24,270
and put the film on the Net, so anybody
can watch it, copy it and download it.

606
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:29,990
Right now, for this project,
online distribution is more positive

607
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:32,630
than copyrighting our film.

608
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:38,950
From Mesopotamian clay tablets
to 21st century best-sellers,

609
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:43,950
there has always been writers and readers,
there will always be authors and viewers.

610
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:48,230
This whole story has shown
that culture will never disappear,

611
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:52,630
but we need flexible, updated IP law.

612
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:57,830
"Cultural Industries" and middlemen
have changed throughout history,

613
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:01,030
and the Internet entails
another huge change...

614
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:06,270
We have to understand that things change,
decrease, evolve and even disappear,

615
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:09,270
and that's not necessarily a bad thing.

616
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:27,550
We'll keep on fighting!
Peace and Community!

617
01:00:28,305 --> 01:00:34,934
