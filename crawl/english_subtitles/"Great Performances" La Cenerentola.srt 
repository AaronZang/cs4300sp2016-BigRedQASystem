2
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:39,605
No one can dance as gracefully as l

3
00:08:50,222 --> 00:08:51,484
lt looks well here

4
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:55,420
No, perhaps it's better here

5
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:59,856
lt makes me look more distinguished

6
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:07,336
All must bow to this artistry
and beauty

7
00:09:48,814 --> 00:09:53,774
Once there was a king ...

8
00:09:55,688 --> 00:10:01,058
... who grew tired of being alone

9
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:08,694
He searched and he found

10
00:10:10,536 --> 00:10:15,633
But there were three
who wanted to marry him

11
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:33,290
What was he to do?
He despised show and beauty

12
00:10:35,961 --> 00:10:43,197
ln the end he chose innocence ...

13
00:10:57,817 --> 00:11:04,120
... innocence and goodness

14
00:11:16,535 --> 00:11:19,197
Cinderella, will you stop
singing that song

15
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,809
ln a corner by the fire ...

16
00:11:33,786 --> 00:11:40,749
... let me sing my song

17
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:02,873
Once there was a king ...

18
00:12:07,486 --> 00:12:09,716
... and on and on

19
00:12:10,956 --> 00:12:13,220
Are you going to stop or not?

20
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:18,057
Otherwise l'll give you ...

21
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:28,001
Who can that be?

22
00:12:45,558 --> 00:12:48,425
Show a little charity

23
00:12:53,432 --> 00:12:56,799
lt's a beggar.
Clear off

24
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,535
Take this

25
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:11,645
Have some breakfast

26
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,413
Perhaps heaven will reward you ...

27
00:13:19,158 --> 00:13:20,557
... before the day is done

28
00:13:31,971 --> 00:13:35,338
No one can inspire love
like us

29
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:40,335
l cannot bear this anguish.
How cruel my fate is

30
00:13:59,098 --> 00:13:59,962
ls he still here?

31
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:02,126
Bread and coffee too?

32
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,398
Help me!

33
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,325
Lovely daughters of Don Magnifico,
Prince Ramiro is on his way

34
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:38,365
He will take you to his palace

35
00:14:38,938 --> 00:14:40,530
There will be singing and dancing

36
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,198
Then the loveliest of his guests ...

37
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:50,243
... will become his darling bride

38
00:15:26,318 --> 00:15:27,580
So the Prince ...?

39
00:15:28,954 --> 00:15:30,046
... is on his way

40
00:15:31,623 --> 00:15:32,920
And the loveliest of his guests ...?

41
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:36,218
... is the one he will choose

42
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,937
Cinderella, come here

43
00:15:47,773 --> 00:15:49,297
My shoes and my bonnet

44
00:15:49,842 --> 00:15:51,275
Cinderella, come here

45
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,872
My feathers and my necklace

46
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:54,575
Cinderella, come here
Cinderella, go there

47
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:56,480
Cinderella, go up
Cinderella, come down

48
00:16:08,193 --> 00:16:11,185
How they bully me

49
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:16,360
They really want to kill me

50
00:16:46,498 --> 00:16:47,965
Don Ramiro will surely fall for me

51
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,831
He'll surely fall for me

52
00:16:50,335 --> 00:16:53,532
Their ruin is at hand.
l could burst with laughter

53
00:18:26,832 --> 00:18:28,094
Give them half a crown

54
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:34,736
Thank you.
We are at the Prince's bidding

55
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:38,337
Are you still here?

56
00:18:39,111 --> 00:18:42,080
What a stink!
Go away or you'll be sorry

57
00:18:43,482 --> 00:18:47,816
l'd have given that half-crown
to you ...

58
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:50,479
... but l haven't half a penny

59
00:18:51,857 --> 00:18:55,486
l'd split my heart in two
to share it with the less fortunate

60
00:18:57,896 --> 00:19:03,198
Perhaps by tomorrow you'll be happy

61
00:19:05,337 --> 00:19:07,965
Cinderella, get our ribbons
and cloaks ready

62
00:19:08,373 --> 00:19:10,364
- The lotions and powders
- My diamonds

63
00:19:10,876 --> 00:19:11,843
Listen to me, sisters

64
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:16,604
What sisters?
Do not defile us with such a word

65
00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:18,910
Be careful not to say it again

66
00:19:19,851 --> 00:19:23,218
There's always some new madness
to endure

67
00:19:29,094 --> 00:19:30,527
There's not a moment to lose

68
00:19:31,363 --> 00:19:33,593
We'd better tell our father

69
00:19:34,366 --> 00:19:36,493
l want to be the first to
tell him the news

70
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:41,765
- Excuse me, l'm the elder
- No, l want to tell him

71
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:46,539
lt's my right. l'll waken him,
and you come along

72
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:50,780
- You won't beat me
- Here he is himself

73
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,824
My feminine offspring

74
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:10,728
l reject your approaches

75
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:16,865
l was having a marvellous dream

76
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:24,480
And you came and disturbed me

77
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:39,730
They're embarrassed

78
00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:43,959
Worthy daughters of a Baron

79
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:53,338
Be quiet and pay attention

80
00:20:56,948 --> 00:21:03,547
Reflect on my dream

81
00:21:12,998 --> 00:21:14,727
lt was partly obscure
and partly clear

82
00:21:16,635 --> 00:21:20,002
l dreamed of a donkey

83
00:21:21,206 --> 00:21:24,403
He was very solemn

84
00:21:25,277 --> 00:21:27,609
Suddenly something miraculous
happened

85
00:21:29,614 --> 00:21:34,381
Hundreds of feathers came
sprouting from its neck

86
00:21:36,988 --> 00:21:38,250
Then off it flew

87
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,225
lt landed on a steeple ...

88
00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:47,562
... as if it were on a throne

89
00:21:50,235 --> 00:21:51,896
And down below ...

90
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:55,438
... the church bells rang

91
00:22:01,213 --> 00:22:04,376
Suddenly l was wakened
by your chattering

92
00:22:36,448 --> 00:22:38,177
What such a confused dream
might mean ...

93
00:22:40,685 --> 00:22:42,414
... l'll explain to you now

94
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,762
The church bells
mean joy in my house

95
00:22:59,971 --> 00:23:02,132
The feathers are you

96
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:05,799
And the flying means
going up in the world

97
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:15,579
As for the donkey,
that's me

98
00:23:17,989 --> 00:23:26,294
lf you think carefully
you'll see the donkey is the father

99
00:23:35,407 --> 00:23:39,935
You'll both give birth to princes

100
00:23:40,612 --> 00:23:43,638
Grandfather will hug
a dozen of your offspring

101
00:23:44,249 --> 00:23:47,184
A little king here,
your servant

102
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:48,877
A baby king there

103
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:54,281
And the glory will fall on me

104
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,410
- lt seems that very soon ...
- Prince Ramiro ...

105
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,115
... who three days ago ...

106
00:24:58,657 --> 00:25:00,284
... came to live
half a mile away ...

107
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:01,918
... will choose a wife

108
00:25:02,394 --> 00:25:03,361
He sent us an invitation

109
00:25:03,728 --> 00:25:05,161
- And shortly ...
- ... he'll come for us

110
00:25:05,764 --> 00:25:09,325
And he'll choose the most beautiful

111
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:16,200
The Prince, although l don't know
him, will choose ...

112
00:25:17,008 --> 00:25:21,843
He's invited you ... A wife ...
l'm going to faint

113
00:25:24,382 --> 00:25:26,441
l've been robbed of my speech

114
00:25:28,053 --> 00:25:32,217
But l feel that the princedom
will be ours

115
00:25:33,525 --> 00:25:36,722
My dream has become reality
and the donkey can fly

116
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,598
Cinderella, bring me my coffee

117
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,606
My children, half this house has
fallen down ...

118
00:25:55,313 --> 00:25:56,610
... and the rest is in danger

119
00:26:02,087 --> 00:26:03,247
Let's shore it up

120
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,421
Use your wits

121
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:15,664
Speak politely,
put on your finest clothes

122
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:23,000
A prince's hand is at stake

123
00:27:38,717 --> 00:27:40,309
The house is deserted

124
00:27:43,154 --> 00:27:48,456
ls there anyone there?
No reply

125
00:28:03,908 --> 00:28:11,405
Disguised like this l shall
observe the ladies

126
00:28:14,552 --> 00:28:15,883
ls no one coming?

127
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:27,089
Yet wise Alidoro said l'd find
someone wise and pretty here ...

128
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:33,236
... someone worthy of me to marry

129
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,977
To marry and not to love

130
00:28:54,793 --> 00:29:06,227
This harsh rule obliges me to make
a difficult choice

131
00:29:15,313 --> 00:29:16,143
l'll search

132
00:29:19,484 --> 00:29:20,416
We'll see

133
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:30,728
Once there was a king ...

134
00:29:34,632 --> 00:29:35,758
My heart is pounding

135
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:38,326
Am l a monster?

136
00:29:38,803 --> 00:29:39,701
Yes

137
00:29:45,276 --> 00:29:48,040
No, sir

138
00:29:57,689 --> 00:30:04,060
Something sweet and mysterious ...

139
00:30:06,831 --> 00:30:13,828
... sparkled in those eyes

140
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:56,206
Why is my heart pounding so?

141
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:34,245
l would tell her, but l don't dare

142
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,253
l want to say something,
but l keep silent

143
00:31:57,608 --> 00:32:08,678
There's something enchanting
about her face

144
00:32:18,329 --> 00:32:26,566
There's something enchanting
about his face

145
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:40,883
How lovely that smile

146
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:50,659
lt enters my heart and
brings me hope

147
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,561
l'm looking
for the Baron's daughters

148
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:12,331
Where are they?

149
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:15,537
l can't see them here

150
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,872
They're in the other rooms

151
00:34:19,817 --> 00:34:21,045
They'll be coming

152
00:34:21,953 --> 00:34:23,045
Goodbye to my hopes

153
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,688
But who are you?

154
00:34:28,493 --> 00:34:29,425
l don't really know

155
00:34:30,128 --> 00:34:31,720
- Don't you know?
- Not really

156
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:43,570
My father isn't my father,
so my sisters ...

157
00:34:44,408 --> 00:34:47,741
My mother was a widow,
but she was their mother too

158
00:34:49,013 --> 00:34:50,241
My father, stuffed with pride ...

159
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:53,945
... isn't my father,
so my sisters ...

160
00:34:57,788 --> 00:34:59,949
l'm getting into a muddle

161
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:07,292
Please forgive me ...

162
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:11,733
... for being so simple

163
00:35:21,812 --> 00:35:25,407
She's captivated me,
l love her simplicity

164
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:36,560
Cinderella, come here

165
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:40,290
Who is shouting?

166
00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:47,436
Whichever way the wind blows,
l never have a moment's rest

167
00:35:48,339 --> 00:35:49,397
l have to do everything

168
00:35:50,374 --> 00:35:53,138
Her voice and her face
are heavenly

169
00:35:54,045 --> 00:35:56,673
l'm quite lost,
l'm no longer myself

170
00:35:57,915 --> 00:36:00,383
Goodbye, sir

171
00:36:04,188 --> 00:36:07,487
l'm coming

172
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:12,888
But l'm leaving my heart behind

173
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:25,371
My heart is in flight,
it's no longer my own

174
00:37:36,447 --> 00:37:43,717
How strange to find such a pretty
face in such shabby clothes

175
00:37:45,156 --> 00:37:47,420
Don Magnifico has not appeared

176
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:51,793
l'd like to announce the arrival
of the pretend Prince

177
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:56,989
l was wisely advised
to dress as a groom

178
00:37:57,802 --> 00:37:59,394
This way l'll learn
what's in the girls' hearts

179
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:03,331
While Dandini plays the Prince ...

180
00:38:04,775 --> 00:38:09,872
A million pardons.
His highness the Prince ...?

181
00:38:10,614 --> 00:38:11,911
- He will soon be here
- When?

182
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:13,045
ln three minutes

183
00:38:14,618 --> 00:38:16,051
Hurry up, daughters

184
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:20,614
l'll hurry them along myself

185
00:38:21,325 --> 00:38:26,695
A century is like a moment
at their dressing-tables

186
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:32,961
What a fool

187
00:38:34,004 --> 00:38:39,203
Yet Alidoro is convinced l'll find
pure goodness in this house

188
00:38:40,644 --> 00:38:45,581
We'll see.
l'll approach his daughters

189
00:38:47,084 --> 00:38:51,020
What a noise!
l'm not mistaken, it's Dandini

190
00:39:44,074 --> 00:39:46,269
Hurry to choose your bride

191
00:39:47,812 --> 00:39:50,110
Time is flying

192
00:39:52,216 --> 00:39:58,121
The princely line
will otherwise die out

193
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:28,678
Just as the bee in April
flies playfully ...

194
00:40:36,527 --> 00:40:42,193
... from the lily to the rose ...

195
00:40:44,335 --> 00:40:51,400
... looking for a flower of his own

196
00:40:57,147 --> 00:41:02,585
l go from one beauty to another

197
00:41:06,257 --> 00:41:08,725
l have seen so many

198
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:21,630
But l can't find sense or
a beautiful face ...

199
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:41,451
... an exquisite morsel for me

200
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,852
Prince ...

201
00:42:23,767 --> 00:42:24,631
Sire ...

202
00:42:25,169 --> 00:42:27,831
How you honour us

203
00:42:28,772 --> 00:42:30,535
What a flood of honours

204
00:42:32,242 --> 00:42:34,676
lt's nothing

205
00:42:36,013 --> 00:42:38,709
How pretty, how gracious

206
00:42:40,217 --> 00:42:42,708
Will that do?

207
00:42:49,126 --> 00:42:50,718
They're the image of their father

208
00:42:51,629 --> 00:42:53,563
Be careful, you idiot

209
00:42:59,069 --> 00:43:06,271
Be kind, and lower your eyes

210
00:43:12,516 --> 00:43:16,043
They make me lose my mind

211
00:43:17,888 --> 00:43:22,916
And with a shot
from a double cannon ...

212
00:43:25,896 --> 00:43:31,027
... a breach has been opened

213
00:44:26,323 --> 00:44:29,724
l'm sure this comedy
will end in tragedy

214
00:45:17,407 --> 00:45:21,207
He's looking at me and sighing.
There's no doubt, he's my slave

215
00:45:23,413 --> 00:45:25,574
- ldiot
- Thank you

216
00:46:47,798 --> 00:46:49,163
How cheerful

217
00:46:53,036 --> 00:46:54,765
Such a lovely mouth and eyes

218
00:46:57,441 --> 00:47:01,138
You are the eighth and ninth
wonders of the world

219
00:47:04,681 --> 00:47:06,615
Like father like daughters

220
00:47:09,052 --> 00:47:10,952
Your highness,
what are you saying?

221
00:47:15,759 --> 00:47:17,659
They are truly Etruscan

222
00:47:18,095 --> 00:47:20,154
- Will that do?
- You're beginning to go too far

223
00:47:20,697 --> 00:47:23,291
l'm playing the grandee,
and l have to shoot in style

224
00:47:24,568 --> 00:47:27,332
Make sure you don't let him go

225
00:47:28,372 --> 00:47:33,776
To continue the discussion
which l haven't started yet ...

226
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,779
l've come back from my travels
to my father

227
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,115
And finding him close to death ...

228
00:47:42,753 --> 00:47:46,484
... l've been ordered to marry,
or lose my inheritance, so l've ...

229
00:47:48,558 --> 00:47:50,116
... invited everyone
in the vicinity ...

230
00:47:50,694 --> 00:47:53,561
... hoping to find a delicate
morsel for myself

231
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:54,793
l've spoken ...

232
00:47:55,799 --> 00:47:57,892
... and now l'll take a breath

233
00:48:02,439 --> 00:48:03,667
Such eloquence

234
00:48:04,508 --> 00:48:05,839
Such a lovely outfit

235
00:48:07,611 --> 00:48:09,272
But the other one is looking at me

236
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:11,837
There she is.
How my heart is beating

237
00:48:12,482 --> 00:48:19,081
Lovely girls, if you would deign to
take the arm of a knight ...

238
00:48:20,257 --> 00:48:21,724
... the carriage is ready

239
00:48:23,927 --> 00:48:26,088
Father, your excellency,
don't keep us waiting

240
00:48:27,164 --> 00:48:29,132
What are you doing here?
Bring my hat and cane

241
00:48:31,001 --> 00:48:34,368
Proceed with your baronial foot ...

242
00:48:35,238 --> 00:48:37,001
... to my magnificent royal quarters

243
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:41,474
l'll follow you

244
00:48:42,612 --> 00:48:44,307
But she's the one
l want to see again

245
00:48:45,182 --> 00:48:47,480
- Leave me alone
- ls he shouting at her?

246
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:50,347
Time is pressing

247
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:54,082
Leave me alone

248
00:48:54,758 --> 00:48:56,953
Just one word

249
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:07,935
Sir, just one word ...

250
00:49:17,481 --> 00:49:21,417
Take me to the Prince's house

251
00:49:24,354 --> 00:49:26,413
And just for an hour ...

252
00:49:27,924 --> 00:49:30,859
... let me dance

253
00:50:10,867 --> 00:50:11,834
What's wrong?

254
00:50:15,005 --> 00:50:16,438
He's standing like a statue

255
00:50:17,307 --> 00:50:18,569
My pretty girl ...

256
00:50:20,243 --> 00:50:21,141
... you've got ideas

257
00:50:21,878 --> 00:50:24,904
You ill-mannered, idle girl

258
00:50:25,949 --> 00:50:26,881
Let's watch this

259
00:50:27,484 --> 00:50:30,647
Leave me, l must go

260
00:50:44,768 --> 00:50:47,100
Are we going or not?

261
00:50:48,371 --> 00:50:50,862
My heart is torn

262
00:50:52,042 --> 00:50:54,738
Just a half-hour, a quarter

263
00:50:55,445 --> 00:50:57,106
l'll make mincemeat of you

264
00:50:57,747 --> 00:50:58,839
Stop!

265
00:51:01,351 --> 00:51:02,841
Your lordship

266
00:51:03,687 --> 00:51:05,211
Get away

267
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:10,091
Your highness

268
00:51:10,961 --> 00:51:13,794
She's a filthy ignorant servant

269
00:51:17,467 --> 00:51:18,900
Servant?

270
00:51:21,438 --> 00:51:23,565
- Servant?
- He means ...

271
00:51:24,274 --> 00:51:27,266
The lowest of the low

272
00:51:35,552 --> 00:51:37,144
She has ideas above her station ...

273
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:40,618
... this dear girl

274
00:51:42,325 --> 00:51:44,350
But she's good for nothing

275
00:51:45,996 --> 00:51:50,729
Go to your room
and do the dusting

276
00:52:00,844 --> 00:52:05,440
l can't hold my anger back

277
00:52:16,059 --> 00:52:24,433
Shall l always have to stay
among the cinders?

278
00:52:40,317 --> 00:52:46,916
Gentlemen, persuade him to take
me to the ball

279
00:52:48,158 --> 00:52:53,960
For ever among the cinders?

280
00:53:55,925 --> 00:54:01,886
My record says that there are three
sisters with Don Magnifico

281
00:54:05,602 --> 00:54:07,968
Three sisters

282
00:54:09,005 --> 00:54:12,736
As the Prince is going
to choose a bride ...

283
00:54:17,814 --> 00:54:22,376
... l ask to see the third

284
00:54:23,787 --> 00:54:26,688
Are you giving me an extra daughter?

285
00:54:28,858 --> 00:54:30,189
The third sister

286
00:54:32,896 --> 00:54:34,796
She ... died

287
00:54:38,068 --> 00:54:39,968
That's not what's written here

288
00:54:40,937 --> 00:54:45,135
They're talking about me

289
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:50,111
No, she didn't die

290
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,470
You keep quiet

291
00:54:57,887 --> 00:54:59,320
Look here

292
00:55:04,394 --> 00:55:07,386
lf you so much as breathe
l'll kill you

293
00:55:08,965 --> 00:55:10,125
Did she die?

294
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:15,501
Your highness

295
00:55:21,111 --> 00:55:24,603
She died

296
00:55:45,368 --> 00:55:53,798
You can see from their
amazed expressions ...

297
00:55:56,012 --> 00:56:06,013
... how their heads are reeling

298
00:56:08,591 --> 00:56:16,965
They're full of doubt
and uncertainty

299
00:56:18,368 --> 00:56:24,967
You can see from their
amazed expressions ...

300
00:56:28,445 --> 00:56:35,510
... how their heads are reeling

301
00:56:41,491 --> 00:56:51,162
They're full of doubt
and uncertainty

302
00:57:57,033 --> 00:57:59,399
lf you say one more word
l'll kill you

303
00:58:01,971 --> 00:58:05,600
Help, don't leave me.
What ever will become of me?

304
00:58:06,976 --> 00:58:08,568
This is making me so angry

305
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:51,001
Everything will change

306
01:00:52,408 --> 01:00:57,812
Their pride will be blown away
like dust

307
01:01:01,117 --> 01:01:08,853
Your tears will turn to smiles

308
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,657
My daughter

309
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:19,324
Are you calling me your daughter?

310
01:01:23,406 --> 01:01:27,809
My step-father
doesn't want to be my father

311
01:01:29,412 --> 01:01:30,379
Whereas you ...

312
01:01:31,013 --> 01:01:35,973
But then, comparing your rags ...

313
01:01:36,853 --> 01:01:44,487
... with mine,
l'd be a worthy daughter to you

314
01:01:50,032 --> 01:01:51,829
Come with me, my daughter

315
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:55,002
Where to?

316
01:01:55,638 --> 01:01:58,163
To the Prince's party

317
01:01:59,675 --> 01:02:03,975
Just because l gave you some food,
are you going to make fun of me?

318
01:02:05,548 --> 01:02:06,708
Away with you

319
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:08,810
l should lock the doors

320
01:02:10,153 --> 01:02:14,146
Thieves might get in,
and then ...

321
01:02:15,925 --> 01:02:17,722
... l'd really be in trouble

322
01:02:19,962 --> 01:02:25,025
Raise your thoughts,
for everything has changed

323
01:02:26,536 --> 01:02:29,027
You will trample treasures
underfoot

324
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:32,673
You will steal everyone's heart

325
01:02:33,409 --> 01:02:36,003
Don't be afraid, come with me

326
01:02:39,749 --> 01:02:44,015
A God whose throne
will last for ever ...

327
01:02:45,588 --> 01:02:49,991
... is the inspiration
for my words

328
01:02:51,761 --> 01:02:55,128
lf you are still unsure ...

329
01:02:56,165 --> 01:02:59,396
... see who l am

330
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:37,768
ln heaven ...

331
01:03:44,247 --> 01:03:50,618
... in the deep mystery of heaven ...

332
01:03:53,589 --> 01:04:00,893
... on the high throne of power ...

333
01:04:03,165 --> 01:04:10,594
... the Lord of the world
watches over us

334
01:04:13,009 --> 01:04:20,006
And the thunder rolls softly
at his feet

335
01:04:22,718 --> 01:04:28,054
He knows and sees everything

336
01:04:31,127 --> 01:04:39,091
He does not let goodness perish

337
01:04:55,451 --> 01:05:05,691
He sees your crying and distress
as you sit by the fire

338
01:05:23,746 --> 01:05:31,744
He sends a bolt of thunder ...

339
01:05:35,157 --> 01:05:41,392
... to change your cruel life

340
01:05:47,403 --> 01:05:50,566
The picture has altered

341
01:05:53,909 --> 01:06:00,473
Your suffering is about to end

342
01:06:56,872 --> 01:07:01,605
Do you hear something approaching?

343
01:07:03,079 --> 01:07:08,483
You will ride to triumph
in my coach

344
01:07:09,919 --> 01:07:12,547
You're confused

345
01:07:14,957 --> 01:07:16,151
Do you have nothing to say?

346
01:07:21,363 --> 01:07:26,198
Your head is spinning ...

347
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:30,431
... like a ship in a storm ...

348
01:07:31,874 --> 01:07:34,240
... tossing up and down

349
01:07:47,189 --> 01:07:53,992
But the cloud has passed
and peace has come

350
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:57,560
Your fate has changed

351
01:07:58,634 --> 01:08:01,159
Your innocence will shine forth

352
01:09:04,166 --> 01:09:08,034
Well done, Don Magnifico

353
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:14,170
You've given us a dissertation
on wines and vintages

354
01:09:16,645 --> 01:09:18,078
l pay homage to your talent

355
01:09:19,114 --> 01:09:20,581
lt's clear he's studied hard

356
01:09:22,084 --> 01:09:25,884
Go down to our cellar

357
01:09:27,122 --> 01:09:31,252
lf you're still standing
at the thirtieth tasting ...

358
01:09:31,961 --> 01:09:34,691
... l'll promote you to
master of the cellar

359
01:09:35,931 --> 01:09:39,526
l can spot talent,
and l reward wisdom

360
01:09:40,603 --> 01:09:44,004
Your highness is a well of kindness

361
01:09:44,673 --> 01:09:46,470
The more comes out,
the more remains

362
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:52,913
Daughters, you're safe.
My promotion is a sure sign

363
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:58,552
Little Clori, little Tisby
keep the Prince happy

364
01:09:59,188 --> 01:10:00,746
l'm going to the cellar

365
01:10:05,594 --> 01:10:08,688
Find out what they're like
and report everything back to me

366
01:10:09,431 --> 01:10:14,425
Run along and carry out my orders.
Did you hear?

367
01:10:15,204 --> 01:10:16,193
l heard

368
01:10:17,273 --> 01:10:20,367
Faithful vassal, l bid you farewell

369
01:10:27,816 --> 01:10:29,044
l'm all yours now

370
01:10:30,853 --> 01:10:33,754
l imagine you are well sculpted

371
01:10:34,857 --> 01:10:39,157
And that Cupid did the sculpting

372
01:10:40,596 --> 01:10:43,030
l am the elder

373
01:10:44,266 --> 01:10:46,996
So l beg preference

374
01:10:48,203 --> 01:10:52,640
l am the younger one,
and won't grow old so fast

375
01:10:53,442 --> 01:10:58,903
Little girl,
she really knows nothing

376
01:11:00,883 --> 01:11:02,510
She's like unsalted water

377
01:11:03,085 --> 01:11:05,349
Neither one thing nor the other

378
01:11:07,523 --> 01:11:10,788
Please take my merits into account

379
01:11:12,995 --> 01:11:15,156
Look, l don't have to wear rouge

380
01:11:16,999 --> 01:11:19,559
But her pale complexion
is just powder

381
01:11:20,602 --> 01:11:21,626
Please favour me

382
01:11:22,137 --> 01:11:24,731
Ladies, do you want to
break me in two?

383
01:11:26,709 --> 01:11:30,372
l have two regal eyes
and l don't wear spectacles

384
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:35,574
Trust me,
my heart beats for you alone

385
01:11:46,395 --> 01:11:47,953
l bow to your highness

386
01:11:51,266 --> 01:11:55,202
l'll bring a petition

387
01:11:55,871 --> 01:11:58,339
- We'll meet again
- Perhaps, perhaps not

388
01:12:00,376 --> 01:12:01,934
l curtsey to you

389
01:12:03,078 --> 01:12:05,410
And l bow to the ground

390
01:12:50,392 --> 01:12:56,592
lnasmuch as thirty bottles
have been tasted ...

391
01:12:57,966 --> 01:13:00,400
... and he has drunk enough
for three ...

392
01:13:01,637 --> 01:13:04,231
... and is still steady
on his feet ...

393
01:13:13,015 --> 01:13:19,477
... his majesty is pleased
to appoint him cellarman

394
01:13:20,722 --> 01:13:27,059
Director of the glasses,
with wide-ranging powers

395
01:13:27,596 --> 01:13:29,689
President of the vintage

396
01:13:32,067 --> 01:13:38,370
And this is why we're
all here crowding round you

397
01:13:50,853 --> 01:13:56,849
Director? Governor? President?
Cellarman?

398
01:14:01,029 --> 01:14:04,123
My heart is jumping for joy

399
01:14:13,475 --> 01:14:15,875
Take down what l have to say

400
01:14:17,145 --> 01:14:19,409
l want six thousand copies made

401
01:14:20,916 --> 01:14:23,111
Our pens are poised

402
01:14:40,035 --> 01:14:45,667
We, Don Magnifico,
in capitals

403
01:14:48,076 --> 01:14:49,270
ldiot, in capitals

404
01:14:53,382 --> 01:14:54,849
WE, DON MAGNlFlCO ...

405
01:14:55,217 --> 01:14:59,916
... Duke and Baron
of ancient Montefiascone ...

406
01:15:00,656 --> 01:15:06,891
... manager, president,
and twenty etceteras

407
01:15:09,665 --> 01:15:14,193
ln the splendour
of his authority ...

408
01:15:16,772 --> 01:15:21,334
... receive the following order:

409
01:15:22,377 --> 01:15:25,039
For fifteen years no wine
may be mixed ...

410
01:15:25,814 --> 01:15:28,977
... with a single drop of water

411
01:15:29,484 --> 01:15:36,219
The penalty is strangulation,
etcetera, etcetera

412
01:15:43,465 --> 01:15:46,161
Baron, etcetera, it's ready now

413
01:15:50,405 --> 01:15:53,203
Now post it up round the city

414
01:16:02,351 --> 01:16:05,479
Now we'll prepare supper

415
01:16:06,054 --> 01:16:08,955
Wine will pour like a flood

416
01:16:13,362 --> 01:16:16,559
A prize of sixteen crowns ...

417
01:16:17,065 --> 01:16:20,296
... for whoever drinks
the most Malaga

418
01:17:47,189 --> 01:17:48,520
Quiet, hush

419
01:17:49,257 --> 01:17:50,747
Not a sound

420
01:17:55,764 --> 01:17:58,927
Tell me truthfully,
what are the two girls like?

421
01:18:25,127 --> 01:18:26,594
Softly, in an undertone

422
01:18:27,896 --> 01:18:29,124
ln strictest confidence

423
01:18:33,401 --> 01:18:36,632
They're a mixture of insolence,
whims and vanity

424
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,427
Alidoro said a daughter
of the Baron ...

425
01:19:00,962 --> 01:19:05,092
Your tutor knows it all,
what a goose he is!

426
01:19:26,488 --> 01:19:30,447
Whoever wants to, can marry them,
but we'll carry on acting

427
01:19:30,959 --> 01:19:34,952
They're a fickle pair,
but the pretence goes on

428
01:20:46,868 --> 01:20:49,598
Princey, where are you?

429
01:20:51,406 --> 01:20:54,034
Princey, where are you?

430
01:20:55,176 --> 01:20:58,703
Why have you abandoned me?

431
01:20:59,748 --> 01:21:03,081
You'll drive me to despair

432
01:21:04,052 --> 01:21:06,077
- l want you
- No, l do

433
01:21:08,256 --> 01:21:12,590
Let's not get upset over trifles

434
01:21:15,563 --> 01:21:19,499
l can't marry both sisters

435
01:21:23,638 --> 01:21:26,072
One will be my wife

436
01:21:27,475 --> 01:21:28,442
And the other?

437
01:21:31,413 --> 01:21:34,405
The other ...

438
01:21:37,686 --> 01:21:39,051
... l'll give to my friend

439
01:21:41,856 --> 01:21:43,653
Goodness me, he's a groom

440
01:21:44,926 --> 01:21:46,689
l'll be gentle and loving

441
01:21:47,228 --> 01:21:49,162
Not a groom

442
01:21:52,233 --> 01:21:53,894
l have a most tender heart

443
01:21:54,569 --> 01:21:57,538
Not a groom

444
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,770
- Common
- Ordinary

445
01:22:08,083 --> 01:22:11,450
l feel ill just thinking about it

446
01:22:12,354 --> 01:22:16,051
This is a scene to remember

447
01:22:16,791 --> 01:22:20,727
l feel ill just thinking about it

448
01:23:07,008 --> 01:23:08,942
Come

449
01:23:11,012 --> 01:23:13,037
Enter

450
01:23:15,116 --> 01:23:16,606
Approach

451
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:31,758
Wise Alidoro ...

452
01:23:34,836 --> 01:23:37,270
... what is this noise?

453
01:23:39,107 --> 01:23:48,778
An unknown woman is approaching,
her face hidden by a veil

454
01:23:53,555 --> 01:23:54,647
A lady

455
01:24:03,731 --> 01:24:04,720
Who is she?

456
01:24:08,803 --> 01:24:09,667
She hasn't said

457
01:24:13,575 --> 01:24:14,872
ls she beautiful?

458
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:19,772
Yes and no

459
01:24:24,152 --> 01:24:25,278
Who can she be?

460
01:24:28,723 --> 01:24:29,849
No one knows

461
01:24:31,826 --> 01:24:34,795
- Hasn't she spoken?
- No, madam

462
01:24:36,965 --> 01:24:39,832
- And she's coming here?
- Who knows why?

463
01:25:01,356 --> 01:25:07,989
l'm already wracked by jealousy

464
01:25:19,407 --> 01:25:21,807
Why am l feeling ...

465
01:25:22,477 --> 01:25:24,104
l've turned to sugar

466
01:25:24,812 --> 01:25:26,871
... such mysterious excitement?

467
01:25:27,715 --> 01:25:30,275
The flies are buzzing round me

468
01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:08,174
You've stolen our hearts
although you're still veiled

469
01:26:17,125 --> 01:26:23,689
lf you remove your veil,
what will happen?

470
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:07,699
l scorn the gifts ...

471
01:27:11,446 --> 01:27:21,185
... which fickle fortune
showers on us

472
01:27:31,232 --> 01:27:36,670
He who wishes to marry me ...

473
01:27:46,181 --> 01:27:51,983
... should offer respect, love
and goodness

474
01:28:37,832 --> 01:28:43,236
Her voice enters my heart

475
01:28:47,909 --> 01:28:52,278
Yet l've heard it before

476
01:28:54,249 --> 01:29:02,987
lt brings me hope
and makes me a new man

477
01:29:38,860 --> 01:29:46,733
Lovely, veiled eyes

478
01:29:54,476 --> 01:30:03,009
Send a piercing glance

479
01:30:20,034 --> 01:30:24,733
Reveal yourselves ...

480
01:30:34,015 --> 01:30:39,783
... if only for politeness' sake

481
01:31:13,087 --> 01:31:15,749
Now we'll see this great miracle

482
01:31:32,974 --> 01:31:38,344
l don't know what to think
or to say

483
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:53,627
This is some trick,
l'm amazed at that face

484
01:34:04,025 --> 01:34:06,585
Your highness, supper is ready

485
01:34:12,033 --> 01:34:12,795
Damn!

486
01:34:13,768 --> 01:34:18,228
The likeness!
Doesn't she look like Cinderella?

487
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:20,931
- That's what we thought too
- But then we looked again

488
01:34:21,676 --> 01:34:23,940
- Ours is clumsy
- This one's more refined

489
01:34:24,612 --> 01:34:27,137
But she's not so lovely
that she can scare us

490
01:34:27,648 --> 01:34:30,378
The other one
sits in rags among the ashes

491
01:34:32,653 --> 01:34:34,712
- The old man's puzzled
- She trembles to see me

492
01:34:35,189 --> 01:34:37,350
Let's not play statues,
some of us are hungry

493
01:34:38,025 --> 01:34:40,459
Let's hurry to supper

494
01:34:44,165 --> 01:34:45,427
Afterwards we'll dance

495
01:34:46,234 --> 01:34:49,692
Then the loveliest
will be my bride

496
01:35:00,948 --> 01:35:05,647
Since l'm the Prince today
l'm going to eat for four

497
01:35:21,035 --> 01:35:24,971
l feel l'm sitting in a garden,
day-dreaming amid the bushes

498
01:35:29,343 --> 01:35:32,676
The streams rustle,
the birds sing

499
01:35:33,414 --> 01:35:37,544
My heart swims in a sea of delight

500
01:35:46,994 --> 01:35:48,985
But underground ...

501
01:35:52,066 --> 01:35:54,000
... very softly ...

502
01:35:57,338 --> 01:35:59,329
... l'm afraid a fire is starting

503
01:36:07,915 --> 01:36:12,784
Suddenly there will be
an earthquake

504
01:36:13,287 --> 01:36:17,849
Everything will shatter
and wake me up

505
01:38:39,266 --> 01:38:43,032
l feel sure those two
are laughing at us behind our backs

506
01:38:43,938 --> 01:38:46,372
By the new wine,
l'll kill them

507
01:38:47,208 --> 01:38:51,167
- Don't get upset, father
- There's plenty to get upset about

508
01:38:51,879 --> 01:38:54,006
That anonymous lady
was the last thing we needed

509
01:38:54,782 --> 01:38:57,307
Can she compete with us
for the Prince's heart?

510
01:38:58,886 --> 01:39:00,717
lt's just that she looks
like Cinderella

511
01:39:02,256 --> 01:39:04,486
She's so like her,
they're identical

512
01:39:06,293 --> 01:39:10,457
That resemblance makes our
step-sister bad news for us

513
01:39:11,298 --> 01:39:16,759
Do you know what kind of storm will
break if anyone discovers ...

514
01:39:17,405 --> 01:39:19,168
... how l've wasted her inheritance?

515
01:39:20,374 --> 01:39:21,432
l've spent everything ...

516
01:39:21,976 --> 01:39:23,910
... to keep you in dresses

517
01:39:24,812 --> 01:39:27,372
l've reduced her to a bag of bones

518
01:39:28,449 --> 01:39:31,714
There would be trouble
if anyone found out

519
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:34,053
Why worry when we're around?

520
01:39:35,156 --> 01:39:37,852
- Are there any grounds for hope?
- There certainly are

521
01:39:40,428 --> 01:39:41,395
Well, l'm sure

522
01:39:42,063 --> 01:39:46,466
l'll soon be handing out honours

523
01:39:47,234 --> 01:39:49,532
ln secret he called me 'my love'

524
01:39:51,939 --> 01:39:54,669
He sighed deeply and left

525
01:39:55,976 --> 01:40:00,310
What's a sigh?
He laughs when he sees me

526
01:40:01,182 --> 01:40:03,150
A sigh here and a laugh there

527
01:40:03,784 --> 01:40:10,189
You're clever, papa,
tell us what you think

528
01:40:11,192 --> 01:40:14,650
l've played two cards
and the chosen one will win

529
01:40:18,365 --> 01:40:20,993
He won't escape you two.
l hope you understand

530
01:40:22,069 --> 01:40:25,527
l'm relying on you

531
01:40:35,382 --> 01:40:41,912
Whichever of my daughters
ascends the throne ...

532
01:40:43,057 --> 01:40:45,617
... don't abandon ...

533
01:40:51,565 --> 01:40:57,663
... don't abandon
your magnificent papa

534
01:41:20,027 --> 01:41:22,689
l can just see people drawing
me aside

535
01:41:23,764 --> 01:41:24,992
Raising their hats they'll say:

536
01:41:25,666 --> 01:41:30,365
'Baron, could you speak to
your royal daughter on my behalf?'

537
01:41:33,474 --> 01:41:41,813
'Here's something for yourself.'
And he slips me a coin

538
01:41:48,055 --> 01:41:50,649
l answer, 'We'll see'

539
01:41:54,295 --> 01:41:55,159
We'll discuss it

540
01:41:56,831 --> 01:42:03,498
Your request can go to the palace

541
01:42:23,858 --> 01:42:28,056
As l turn, a little bonnet
bows to me

542
01:42:29,096 --> 01:42:30,324
All sighs and courtesies

543
01:42:31,265 --> 01:42:37,295
'My dear Baron, you remember
that matter ...'

544
01:42:38,706 --> 01:42:42,039
She knows that without money
l turn a deaf ear

545
01:42:42,543 --> 01:42:43,703
She stretches out her hand ...

546
01:42:45,713 --> 01:42:50,946
... and slips me a coin

547
01:42:53,554 --> 01:42:56,045
Then l'm gallant:
'Such lovely eyes,' l say

548
01:42:57,524 --> 01:43:00,049
'What can l refuse you?'

549
01:43:01,996 --> 01:43:08,458
'l only wish to make you happy'

550
01:43:18,946 --> 01:43:20,538
l waken at midday

551
01:43:22,449 --> 01:43:24,110
At once l ring the bell

552
01:43:26,253 --> 01:43:30,849
And a crowd of supplicants
surrounds my bed

553
01:43:31,659 --> 01:43:33,024
They want protection, redress

554
01:43:33,494 --> 01:43:35,223
Some fool wants to be
a professor

555
01:43:47,341 --> 01:43:50,003
They want exclusive rights
to brooches or eel-fishing

556
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:57,149
l'm surrounded by petitions ...

557
01:43:58,018 --> 01:44:01,181
... and by bottles, brocades,
candles and foods of every kind

558
01:44:08,529 --> 01:44:14,798
Stop it! That's enough!
Will you leave now!

559
01:44:19,506 --> 01:44:22,771
l lock and chain the door

560
01:44:23,377 --> 01:44:26,744
lnfuriating opportunists,
away with you

561
01:45:14,028 --> 01:45:17,293
Are you still dreaming that
the Prince is thinking of you?

562
01:45:17,965 --> 01:45:18,795
You're asking me?

563
01:45:19,533 --> 01:45:20,830
Your highness's servant

564
01:45:21,935 --> 01:45:23,459
At your service

565
01:45:30,778 --> 01:45:39,777
This lovely stranger looks so like
the poor girl we met this morning

566
01:45:40,387 --> 01:45:44,187
She's filled my heart with
a new desire

567
01:45:45,225 --> 01:45:47,489
Dandini seems in love with her
as well

568
01:45:48,328 --> 01:45:49,022
They're coming

569
01:45:49,863 --> 01:45:52,093
l want to hear them unseen

570
01:45:59,706 --> 01:46:06,134
Don't run away. You've made me
walk round the terrace four times

571
01:46:07,114 --> 01:46:09,639
Either change your tone
or l'll go

572
01:46:11,618 --> 01:46:16,146
ls talk of love hurting you?

573
01:46:17,257 --> 01:46:20,784
But l love someone else

574
01:46:21,762 --> 01:46:23,059
Can you say that to my face?

575
01:46:23,931 --> 01:46:29,870
Don't be angry if l speak honestly

576
01:46:30,471 --> 01:46:32,029
- Who is it you love?
- Excuse me?

577
01:46:32,606 --> 01:46:33,732
Who is it you love?

578
01:46:35,175 --> 01:46:36,164
Your groom

579
01:46:38,545 --> 01:46:40,706
What joy, my love!

580
01:46:41,181 --> 01:46:42,341
lt's going perfectly

581
01:46:43,650 --> 01:46:48,349
Aren't you tempted by rank
and riches?

582
01:46:49,790 --> 01:46:54,557
Virtue and goodness are
the things l value

583
01:46:57,664 --> 01:46:59,097
Would you be mine then?

584
01:46:59,766 --> 01:47:05,102
First you must find me,
get to know me

585
01:47:06,707 --> 01:47:08,538
Witness my position

586
01:47:09,576 --> 01:47:11,203
l shall fly to you, my darling

587
01:47:11,979 --> 01:47:14,607
Do not follow me, l command you

588
01:47:17,184 --> 01:47:19,175
How shall l find you then?

589
01:47:22,289 --> 01:47:28,626
Take this, and look for me

590
01:47:29,663 --> 01:47:33,531
lf you find its companion on
my right arm ...

591
01:47:35,302 --> 01:47:43,539
... then, if l don't displease you,
l shall be yours

592
01:47:49,583 --> 01:47:50,811
What do you think, Dandini?

593
01:47:52,553 --> 01:47:56,353
l think l've changed from Prince
to witness

594
01:48:00,727 --> 01:48:07,633
Then, if l don't displease you,
l shall be yours

595
01:48:08,535 --> 01:48:10,230
What sort of words are these?

596
01:48:12,573 --> 01:48:15,542
My wise, venerable tutor

597
01:48:16,410 --> 01:48:23,179
Love has entered my heart.
What should l do?

598
01:48:23,984 --> 01:48:25,975
Follow your heart

599
01:48:31,091 --> 01:48:32,786
You are no longer the Prince

600
01:48:34,895 --> 01:48:38,854
Empty my palace of those
silly women

601
01:48:43,704 --> 01:48:48,300
Prepare my coach

602
01:48:51,411 --> 01:48:58,783
Let me fly on the wings of the wind

603
01:49:09,329 --> 01:49:15,063
l swear that l shall find her

604
01:49:19,072 --> 01:49:25,602
Love drives me on

605
01:49:35,489 --> 01:49:38,617
Even if she is
in Jupiter's arms ...

606
01:49:39,793 --> 01:49:41,886
... l shall find her

607
01:51:13,153 --> 01:51:23,085
l am charmed by this dear token

608
01:51:37,577 --> 01:51:42,981
How l shall press you to my heart

609
01:52:32,933 --> 01:52:34,400
We shall fly and enquire

610
01:52:36,736 --> 01:52:38,499
We shall search and find

611
01:52:53,787 --> 01:52:59,248
Sweet hope and cold fear
are battling in my heart

612
01:55:13,627 --> 01:55:21,727
So am l an ex-prince?
Cast down to nothing in an instant?

613
01:55:23,703 --> 01:55:26,831
l was really very good at it

614
01:55:29,209 --> 01:55:33,543
Pardon my haste,
but the two girls are in a frenzy

615
01:55:34,514 --> 01:55:37,108
Could l press you to choose?

616
01:55:41,154 --> 01:55:43,088
The choice has been made

617
01:55:43,990 --> 01:55:46,857
Then tell me, l beg you

618
01:55:47,994 --> 01:55:52,795
Will my offspring come and blossom
in these rooms?

619
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:58,633
They'll find out later.
For the moment it's a secret

620
01:55:59,339 --> 01:56:03,867
Which is it, Clorinda or Tisbe?

621
01:56:04,711 --> 01:56:05,735
Don't be in such a hurry

622
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:08,213
Tell their father

623
01:56:08,848 --> 01:56:09,974
But keep quiet

624
01:56:10,750 --> 01:56:12,217
Of course, but tell me quickly

625
01:56:19,893 --> 01:56:21,155
Can no one hear us?

626
01:56:23,897 --> 01:56:26,422
There's not a fly in the air

627
01:56:27,267 --> 01:56:30,031
There's a mystery
that will amaze you

628
01:56:30,937 --> 01:56:31,733
l'm in agony

629
01:56:36,409 --> 01:56:37,740
Let's sit down

630
01:56:38,978 --> 01:56:39,967
Quickly, please

631
01:56:49,289 --> 01:56:52,486
lt's a highly unusual situation

632
01:57:03,870 --> 01:57:05,235
Does he want to marry me?

633
01:57:07,173 --> 01:57:08,367
l beg you

634
01:57:09,409 --> 01:57:10,706
Your servant

635
01:57:11,311 --> 01:57:13,677
Keep your lips sealed ...

636
01:57:14,247 --> 01:57:15,771
... about what l'm going to say

637
01:57:16,282 --> 01:57:19,513
l've a safe deposit box inside me

638
01:57:29,129 --> 01:57:35,728
An important secret,
an intriguing mystery

639
01:57:39,405 --> 01:57:40,872
That's what l have to reveal

640
01:57:46,946 --> 01:57:48,607
lt's extraordinary

641
01:57:54,187 --> 01:57:55,449
You'll be astounded

642
01:58:12,338 --> 01:58:19,267
Not batting an eyelid,
not taking a breath ...

643
01:58:22,882 --> 01:58:24,372
... l'm listening

644
01:58:30,456 --> 01:58:31,480
l'll be like a statue

645
01:58:38,097 --> 01:58:39,587
l'll count every syllable

646
01:58:55,849 --> 01:59:00,149
A man of wisdom and maturity
always gives the best advice

647
01:59:01,087 --> 01:59:05,251
lf l married your daughter,
how should l treat her?

648
01:59:05,792 --> 01:59:07,054
l'm going to be a counsellor!

649
01:59:07,594 --> 01:59:11,257
You're too gracious, your excellency

650
01:59:12,065 --> 01:59:14,829
l mean, your highness, listen to me

651
01:59:22,575 --> 01:59:28,411
Always have thirty servants on call,
and one hundred and sixteen horses

652
01:59:29,582 --> 01:59:32,745
lnvite dozens of dukes and counts

653
01:59:33,219 --> 01:59:36,279
Have ice-cream with every dinner,
carriages and coaches

654
01:59:40,727 --> 01:59:44,663
There's a misunderstanding

655
01:59:46,332 --> 01:59:47,697
l don't have dinners

656
01:59:48,368 --> 01:59:51,496
l eat the left-overs,
and don't mix with gentlemen

657
01:59:52,205 --> 01:59:55,572
l stay with the servants
and l always go on foot

658
01:59:56,776 --> 01:59:57,765
You're joking

659
01:59:58,645 --> 01:59:59,669
l assure you

660
02:00:00,513 --> 02:00:01,480
Then what's this?

661
02:00:02,282 --> 02:00:03,249
lt's a fiction

662
02:00:09,389 --> 02:00:11,016
lt's a joke that l'm a prince

663
02:00:12,859 --> 02:00:14,383
l'm in disguise

664
02:00:15,295 --> 02:00:16,785
The real prince has come

665
02:00:17,563 --> 02:00:19,190
He's unmasked me

666
02:00:20,300 --> 02:00:22,268
l'm going back to my post

667
02:00:30,777 --> 02:00:34,611
l'm Dandini the valet

668
02:00:43,890 --> 02:00:46,450
l make beds and brush clothes

669
02:00:47,694 --> 02:00:50,788
l shave the prince
and dress his hair

670
02:01:00,974 --> 02:01:04,774
For this outrage the real prince ...

671
02:01:05,411 --> 02:01:06,378
... will have to pay

672
02:01:06,913 --> 02:01:09,575
Don't worry, he won't do a thing

673
02:01:11,484 --> 02:01:12,712
You'd better leave at once

674
02:01:13,686 --> 02:01:16,280
- l won't leave
- You will

675
02:01:16,789 --> 02:01:18,814
- l'm a baron
- There's a stick waiting

676
02:01:19,392 --> 02:01:20,256
We'll be seeing each other

677
02:01:20,827 --> 02:01:21,794
We'll be discussing this

678
02:02:43,409 --> 02:02:55,253
Once there was a king
who grew tired of being alone

679
02:02:58,858 --> 02:03:04,455
He searched and he found

680
02:03:06,432 --> 02:03:13,270
But there were three
who wanted to marry him

681
02:03:20,213 --> 02:03:31,454
What was he to do?
He despised show and beauty

682
02:03:34,393 --> 02:03:46,134
ln the end he chose innocence

683
02:03:58,017 --> 02:04:04,547
lnnocence and goodness

684
02:04:24,210 --> 02:04:26,269
How dear you are to me

685
02:04:27,747 --> 02:04:34,209
And the man l gave your companion
to is dearer still

686
02:04:37,290 --> 02:04:39,622
What did the Prince mean
by pulling such faces?

687
02:04:42,662 --> 02:04:50,228
l love only a handsome face
and an honest heart

688
02:04:51,871 --> 02:04:53,566
l prefer his groom

689
02:04:56,609 --> 02:05:02,639
As for my sisters!
They seemed to have gone mad

690
02:05:06,219 --> 02:05:07,151
What's that noise?

691
02:05:07,887 --> 02:05:09,252
Such awful expressions

692
02:05:11,224 --> 02:05:12,191
You're back

693
02:05:14,093 --> 02:05:16,891
l didn't think you'd be
back until dawn

694
02:05:17,863 --> 02:05:18,830
l told you so

695
02:05:19,765 --> 02:05:24,361
But they're absolutely identical

696
02:05:26,339 --> 02:05:28,739
She was the original,
this one's the portrait

697
02:05:32,378 --> 02:05:34,209
- Have you done everything?
- Everything

698
02:05:35,948 --> 02:05:39,213
Why are you looking at me like that?

699
02:05:40,019 --> 02:05:43,682
Because of a witch who
looks like you

700
02:05:44,423 --> 02:05:45,481
l could beat your shoulders

701
02:05:47,693 --> 02:05:51,322
What have my shoulders got to do
with it?

702
02:05:59,772 --> 02:06:03,105
There's a storm coming

703
02:06:03,409 --> 02:06:04,569
More than a storm!

704
02:06:05,177 --> 02:06:07,475
l'd like the valet
to be struck by lightning

705
02:06:08,147 --> 02:06:13,107
Tell me what's happened.
Have you some secret torment?

706
02:06:13,886 --> 02:06:15,786
ldiot, go and prepare supper

707
02:06:19,225 --> 02:06:25,789
What a terrible temper!
But l have the groom in my heart

708
02:09:20,639 --> 02:09:21,936
Excuse me, my friends

709
02:09:22,942 --> 02:09:25,308
The Prince's carriage
has overturned

710
02:09:28,447 --> 02:09:31,143
lt's you.
But where's the Prince?

711
02:09:33,185 --> 02:09:35,813
- You know him
- The groom!

712
02:09:39,692 --> 02:09:41,626
Excuse me if by chance ...

713
02:09:42,094 --> 02:09:43,220
Don't mention it, sir

714
02:09:45,664 --> 02:09:49,566
He's come here for a reason.
One of you will be his bride

715
02:09:51,604 --> 02:09:54,596
Cinderella, bring the best chair

716
02:09:55,407 --> 02:09:59,104
No, l have only a few minutes.
Another carriage is coming

717
02:10:01,614 --> 02:10:02,672
Hurry up, Cinderella

718
02:10:04,517 --> 02:10:06,178
Give it to the Prince

719
02:10:07,286 --> 02:10:08,275
Here he is

720
02:10:11,323 --> 02:10:15,817
This one.
What do l see!

721
02:10:18,364 --> 02:10:19,353
- The Prince
- Stop

722
02:10:20,533 --> 02:10:23,934
The bracelet.
lt's her

723
02:10:24,970 --> 02:10:27,097
What joy l feel

724
02:10:32,878 --> 02:10:34,368
ls it you?

725
02:10:37,383 --> 02:10:40,147
Are you the Prince?

726
02:10:43,556 --> 02:10:45,421
What a surprise

727
02:10:48,327 --> 02:10:49,919
Marvellous!

728
02:10:53,799 --> 02:10:54,697
Silence

729
02:10:57,836 --> 02:10:59,167
My brain has gone

730
02:11:08,213 --> 02:11:09,874
What will happen?

731
02:11:24,463 --> 02:11:32,302
This is a twisted knot,
a tangled web

732
02:11:33,339 --> 02:11:41,246
This is a twisted knot,
a tangled web

733
02:12:09,008 --> 02:12:17,040
The more you try to undo it,
the tighter it gets

734
02:12:18,050 --> 02:12:26,116
Meanwhile my head is spinning

735
02:12:27,226 --> 02:12:34,758
l'm feeling in the dark,
beginning to go mad

736
02:15:43,522 --> 02:15:45,990
Silly, slovenly girl

737
02:15:47,426 --> 02:15:50,088
Who do you think you are?

738
02:15:53,966 --> 02:15:59,461
lt's rude to sit with your betters

739
02:16:17,556 --> 02:16:20,024
Audacious servant

740
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:24,488
Who told you to stay with
the likes of us?

741
02:16:27,966 --> 02:16:33,370
Go to the kitchen
and don't come back

742
02:16:51,657 --> 02:16:52,817
You dreadful people

743
02:16:53,759 --> 02:17:00,062
ln vain you try to
insult the woman l adore

744
02:17:02,734 --> 02:17:08,366
Be warned, for my anger will fall
on you

745
02:17:22,120 --> 02:17:24,179
l knew this comedy ...

746
02:17:25,624 --> 02:17:27,888
... would change in the second act

747
02:17:28,527 --> 02:17:34,488
Now it's a tragedy
and l'm really enjoying it

748
02:17:44,543 --> 02:17:45,805
l've turned to ice

749
02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:49,047
l'm struck dumb

750
02:17:49,681 --> 02:17:52,650
He's turned into an idiot

751
02:17:53,986 --> 02:17:56,477
- But a servant ...
- Be silent

752
02:17:57,656 --> 02:18:03,720
l can't contain my anger any more

753
02:18:26,251 --> 02:18:33,384
Sir, if it's true that
in your heart ...

754
02:18:35,961 --> 02:18:43,265
... you have some love for me

755
02:18:47,439 --> 02:19:00,147
Then pardon them,
and let goodness triumph

756
02:19:18,937 --> 02:19:24,842
Look at those tears,
at her frankness and innocence

757
02:19:26,478 --> 02:19:28,207
Look at that hypocrite

758
02:20:37,282 --> 02:20:39,477
Your highness,
what is it you want?

759
02:20:42,854 --> 02:20:46,881
Don't speak another word

760
02:20:49,161 --> 02:20:55,259
She will be my bride

761
02:20:58,003 --> 02:20:59,061
He's just joking

762
02:21:04,209 --> 02:21:07,610
Don't you see it's a joke?

763
02:21:10,182 --> 02:21:12,377
l swear it

764
02:21:21,026 --> 02:21:22,459
She will be mine

765
02:21:23,128 --> 02:21:25,119
But l thought that
one of my daughters ...

766
02:21:25,730 --> 02:21:27,163
l am not for them

767
02:21:29,434 --> 02:21:33,461
l'm common, l'm ordinary

768
02:21:40,045 --> 02:21:45,745
The ball has come bouncing back

769
02:21:52,891 --> 02:22:01,128
And the champion has tossed it
back in the air

770
02:22:28,927 --> 02:22:31,919
Come and reign with me

771
02:22:36,167 --> 02:22:39,295
Kiss me first

772
02:22:42,207 --> 02:22:45,301
Embrace me

773
02:22:46,611 --> 02:22:48,511
Go away

774
02:22:52,651 --> 02:22:54,448
You heartless people

775
02:22:55,553 --> 02:22:57,248
You will tremble

776
02:23:14,005 --> 02:23:15,495
Grumbling, complaining ...

777
02:23:16,141 --> 02:23:17,005
This is an enchantment

778
02:23:17,609 --> 02:23:18,974
Shouting and raging ...

779
02:23:21,246 --> 02:23:22,645
Fuming and crying ...

780
02:23:23,214 --> 02:23:24,442
ls it a dream?

781
02:23:24,883 --> 02:23:26,180
Threatening and sighing ...

782
02:23:26,718 --> 02:23:27,844
Everything has changed

783
02:24:49,901 --> 02:24:56,568
- So we're a laughing stock
- l'm almost blind with rage

784
02:24:57,275 --> 02:25:00,711
lt feels like a dream.
Cinderella ...

785
02:25:01,279 --> 02:25:02,803
... will be a princess

786
02:25:04,983 --> 02:25:05,779
Who are you?

787
02:25:06,684 --> 02:25:11,246
l asked you for charity,
you sent me away

788
02:25:13,324 --> 02:25:18,489
But Angelina was not deaf
to another's misfortunes

789
02:25:19,397 --> 02:25:24,096
You kept her as a servant,
among the cinders, dressed in rags

790
02:25:24,602 --> 02:25:26,729
Now she will ascend the throne

791
02:25:27,539 --> 02:25:29,939
What will happen to us?

792
02:25:31,676 --> 02:25:37,239
You can choose whether to end
your days in poverty

793
02:25:41,619 --> 02:25:45,180
Or go to the throne
and beg for pardon

794
02:25:46,357 --> 02:25:51,761
l myself have prepared the
wedding party

795
02:25:53,398 --> 02:25:55,423
Now is your chance

796
02:25:56,901 --> 02:25:59,597
Abase myself to her?

797
02:26:00,205 --> 02:26:01,570
What despair!

798
02:26:11,282 --> 02:26:15,582
lt's hard,
but you must swallow the pill

799
02:26:18,356 --> 02:26:20,256
And what are your thoughts?

800
02:26:22,894 --> 02:26:26,625
l'll accept my fate. After all,
humiliation is not going to kill me

801
02:26:35,540 --> 02:26:43,072
Thank you, heaven.
All my hopes are fulfilled

802
02:26:44,616 --> 02:26:49,644
Pride has been vanquished.
My pupil will be happy

803
02:26:51,756 --> 02:26:58,628
Goodness has triumphed,
and l am content

804
02:27:43,408 --> 02:27:49,813
The wheel of fickle fortune ...

805
02:27:51,783 --> 02:27:57,847
... has reached the top
and halted for you

806
02:28:04,762 --> 02:28:07,663
Pride has crumbled into dust

807
02:28:13,504 --> 02:28:15,972
Goodness has triumphed

808
02:29:01,019 --> 02:29:02,179
My bride

809
02:29:03,955 --> 02:29:15,025
Forgive me if l'm still uncertain
and confused

810
02:29:18,336 --> 02:29:23,831
Not long ago l sat among the ashes

811
02:29:26,144 --> 02:29:35,485
Now l am on the throne

812
02:29:41,726 --> 02:29:44,160
Your highness, l bow before you

813
02:29:45,196 --> 02:29:50,156
Will you never call me
your daughter?

814
02:29:52,804 --> 02:29:54,294
Those proud women ...

815
02:29:55,039 --> 02:30:02,468
Prince, l fall at your feet.
l've forgotten the injustices of old

816
02:30:04,115 --> 02:30:14,081
l want to be more than equal
to the throne

817
02:30:16,761 --> 02:30:21,630
My vengeance ...

818
02:30:31,375 --> 02:30:35,209
... will be to forgive them

819
02:31:14,719 --> 02:31:24,492
l was born into pain and tears

820
02:31:28,132 --> 02:31:39,771
l suffered while my heart
kept silent

821
02:31:52,023 --> 02:32:04,367
But by magic
in the flower of my years ...

822
02:32:07,839 --> 02:32:16,213
... in a sudden flash ...

823
02:32:21,652 --> 02:32:28,421
... my fate has changed

824
02:33:13,838 --> 02:33:17,330
No, dry your eyes

825
02:33:18,142 --> 02:33:20,906
Why be afraid?

826
02:33:24,916 --> 02:33:27,817
Come to me

827
02:33:32,623 --> 02:33:37,754
A daughter, a sister, a friend

828
02:33:39,363 --> 02:33:47,463
l shall be all these to you

829
02:33:54,645 --> 02:34:00,242
She touches us like a goddess

830
02:34:01,919 --> 02:34:03,910
Father, husband

831
02:34:05,356 --> 02:34:07,085
Friend, oh what a moment!

832
02:34:07,892 --> 02:34:10,884
You are equal to the throne

833
02:34:14,332 --> 02:34:17,495
But a throne is a trifle to you

834
02:34:56,040 --> 02:35:04,277
l shan't sit alone by the fire
singing sadly any more

835
02:35:07,184 --> 02:35:17,424
My long days of suffering
were a dream, a game

836
02:35:18,305 --> 02:35:24,363
