If I had the nerve,

I'm gonna get him
into your choir.

you'll need to blacken up a bit.

Not so much that you become

00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,706
but you know,

429
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,648
you kind of act too white.

430
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,743
You're not black enough for me!

431
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,913
Put a little soul
in your stroll.

00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,726
he could have bathed
in her fire.

435
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,163
But he's still got to deal
with that dorky youth choir.

436
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,866
- Greetings, Christian comrade.

437
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,427
Mr. Franklin has requested

- What?

440
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,238
- It's a mandatory ritual
for new choir members.

441
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,402
- Oh, God.

442

- Exactly!

443

The man behind the wheel

was none other
than Franklin Jones.

451

- [coughing]
I'm just the vessel.

- Church pianist,
youth choir director,

but more significantly,
the Reverend Jones' son.

454
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,937
- That's right, Mom.

455
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,345
I'm smoking weed
with the reverend's son.

456
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:47,079
He works
in mysterious ways indeed.

457
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,485
- Our hero had found his tribe.

458
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,081
Now Sherry and Terry
were the bad kids at church.

459
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,958
Terry obsessively drew cartoons
of Jesus water skiing.

460
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,518
- Check it out.

461
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,224
- And Sherry always looked
at our hero

462
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,858
as if she knew his most
carefully guarded secret.

463
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,992
And as for Mr. Franklin,

464
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,230
well, he was a completely
different person

465
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,430
when it wasn't Sunday morning.

Yes, it's me, darlings,

00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:22,745
with my funny nose,
skinny legs, and all.

471
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,221
And I have nothing to hide.

472
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:29,785
If I were any more real, child,
I'd be fictional.

[laughs]

474
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,663
Children, if we were
in Amsterdam right now,

475
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,396
we'd be inhaling this-
this sacrament

476
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:41,133
in a comfy café
with a wicked cup of espresso.

- In flagrante delicto, kinder!

479
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:49,205
Nobody's hiding anything
over there.

480
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,715
Dig me?

481
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,616

482

§ And yes, there's a place
in this world... §

00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:50,997

497
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,032
- § For everyone... §

498
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,237
- Or whoever you are tonight.

499
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:54,711
I mean, baby,

500
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:57,340
we're all freaks depending
on the backdrop, you know?

501
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,371

502
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:02,285
Yeah, we're all freaks...

503
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,948
- Lookin' for a home.

504
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,186
And as for this
Philistine fishbowl

505
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,214
we're swimmin' around in?

506
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,386
Shoot!

507
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:11,794
If you want to deal
with le real,

508
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,994
I'm talking Stockholm,
baby, persona, you know?

509
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,399
I'm talking about Rome

510
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,405
and one of them La Dolce Vita
parties, you know?

511
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:23,135
I'm talking about
Godard's Paris, baby, I mean,

512
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,201
'cause we a Band of Outsiders
too, you know.

513
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:29,509
I mean, I'm talking
about brother Al Camus,

514
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,743
The Stranger.

515
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:32,875
Brother said, "Algeria?

516
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,044
"See ya!

517
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,485
Wouldn't want to be ya, okay? "

518
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,186
I mean talkin' about
little Jimmy Baldwin, baby.

519
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:45,095
You got to go to Another Country

520
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:50,659
if you want to get
to Giovanni's Room.

521
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,694
Ha!

522
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,173
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

523
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,197
[chuckles]

524
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,402
- Half the time he didn't know

525
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,377
what the fuck Mr. Franklin
was talking about.

526
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:01,674
But that was cool,

527
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,943
'cause Franklin's words
would just wash over him

528
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:07,076
Iike a Bach fugue creeping out
of a cheap car stereo

529
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,383
on the brother side of midnight.

530
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,821
You know how when the music
goes right over your head

531
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,724
and straight into that part
of you which is most beautiful?

532
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,888
I mean, when your mind can't
grasp the music's math,

533
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,420
§ And your heartbeat
has no clue §

534
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,957
§ Your pilgrim soul just
follows the melody's path §

535
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,095
§ Then it looks back §

536
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,230
§ It looks back and says §

537
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,933
§ I want to thank you, brother §

538
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,738
§ Hey, I want to
thank you brother §

539
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:35,213
§ Hey, I want to thank you
for this fugue §

540
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,681
§ And it just is and is
and is so much §

541
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,809
§ That whether you get it
or not it's got §

is beautiful §

544
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:56,195
§ And they are laughing
in the Sun §

545
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:59,761
§ Then they parachute
into church §

546
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:07,268
§ So they can sing
before practice is done §

547
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:10,247
§ When they raise one voice §

548
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,308
§ Stoned angels weep §

549
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:15,615
§ Then he feels the Holy Ghost §

550
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:19,283
§ And it's creeping up slowly §

551
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,315
- Where should I go in Europe?

552
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,986
- Anywhere.

553
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,017
- Where did you go?

554
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:27,327
- Nowhere.

555
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:31,529
Holy Father keeps me
on a short leash,

556
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:36,633
keeps me in check
by signing the checks.

557
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:40,611
You could say that he's
paying me to not be myself.

558
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,478
I could say that I'm chained
to the church piano.

559
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:47,713
But that would an insult
to actual slaves.

560
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,947
- These were the parameters
of the cage.

561
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,480
- Because you see, my boy,
slaves-

562
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,460
oh yeah, that's it.

563
00:24:56,495 --> 00:25:00,989
Slaves got options.

564
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,091
Options, you dig?

565
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:09,505
I'm talking escape, revolt,
death.

566
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:12,772
Options.

567
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:19,774
But cowards ain't got shit.

568
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:27,418
Cowards only have consequences.

569
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,983
Dig me?

570
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:33,191
Hmm?

571
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:38,635
Do you dig me?

572
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:43,164
- Hey, man, don't let him know
you're freaked out.

573
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,041
Say something clever.

574
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,102
- I don't believe in God.

575
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:50,137
- Does He know?

576
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:52,843
[chuckles]

577
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:57,116
Does He know?

578
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:58,952
I appreciate your feeling
compelled to share

579
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,685
one of your deep and dirty
secrets with me.

580
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,283
That was very sweet of you.

581
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:06,559
I apologize if I went overboard.

582
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:13,934
So in this corner,

583
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:20,138
the sensitive, artistic soul.

584
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:24,114
And in this corner,

585
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:27,812
moi, La Franklin,

586
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:31,049
the wicked Baptist rebel.

587
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,354
Yet, in the end,

588
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:40,126
we're just
two brothers passing.

589
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,759
Like your high yellow grandma
back in the day,

590
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:47,397
only we're passing
for black folks.

591
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,066
Ha.

Good lawn trimmin', tax payin',

narrow-minded Christian
black folk.

595
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:59,846
- Now ain't that a bitch?

596
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:02,819
- Black folks passing
for black folks.

597
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:03,843
That's a trip.

598

[laughter]

599
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:07,353

00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,825
- It'd be fiction.

601
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,091

602
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,758

01:41:37,223 --> 01:41:38,485
- What do you want
to talk about?

2201
01:41:38,525 --> 01:41:40,959
- Oh, you know,
lots of things.

2202
01:41:40,994 --> 01:41:43,861
- Like?

2203
01:41:43,897 --> 01:41:45,194
- Well, I mean, first of all,

2204
01:41:45,231 --> 01:41:46,960
you've been on this trip
of yours for so long.

2205
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,433
- Trip?

2206
01:41:48,468 --> 01:41:50,493
- And you're so hard to reach.
- Mom, this is not a trip.

2207
01:41:50,537 --> 01:41:52,437
- And there are so many things
we have to talk about.

2208
01:41:52,472 --> 01:41:53,496
- I live here now.

2209
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:54,871
- Important things.

2210
01:41:54,908 --> 01:41:56,535
We have important things
to talk about.

2211
01:41:56,576 --> 01:41:58,476
- Mom, I live here now.

2212
01:41:59,546 --> 01:42:01,343
Did you hear me?

2213
01:42:01,381 --> 01:42:04,714
- Now, one thing you need to
realize right here and now, son,

2214
01:42:04,751 --> 01:42:05,775
is that I am-

2215
01:42:05,819 --> 01:42:08,379
I mean, your family
is important.

2216
01:42:08,421 --> 01:42:10,218
You can't just sit over there
and act like I-

2217
01:42:10,256 --> 01:42:12,417
Iike we don't exist!

2218
01:42:12,459 --> 01:42:13,790
Family is not some-

2219
01:42:13,827 --> 01:42:16,660
some service you can take
advantage of for 20 years

2220
01:42:16,696 --> 01:42:18,527
and then cancel when it's
convenient for you.

2221
01:42:18,565 --> 01:42:19,862
It don't work like that.

2222
01:42:19,899 --> 01:42:22,060
- I couldn't come back
even if I wanted to.

2223
01:42:22,102 --> 01:42:23,330
- Why not?

2224
01:42:23,370 --> 01:42:25,133
- Why leave a place where
I can be myself

2225
01:42:25,171 --> 01:42:26,570
to come back to a place
where I can't?

2226
01:42:26,606 --> 01:42:28,767
- Why do you need a particular
place to be yourself?

2227
01:42:28,808 --> 01:42:29,968
Can't you be yourself at home?

2228
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:30,999
- No, Mom!

2229
01:42:31,044 --> 01:42:32,409
I'm already 22.

2230
01:42:32,445 --> 01:42:34,538
Life's passing me by.

2231
01:42:34,581 --> 01:42:37,106
Los Angeles is just death row
with palm trees.

2232
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:38,947
I'm scared of waking up one day
and being-

2233
01:42:38,985 --> 01:42:41,249
- Me?

2234
01:42:41,287 --> 01:42:45,519
- Well, and not having lived
the life I wanted to live.

2235
01:42:45,558 --> 01:42:51,326
- Your deep concern for yourself
is very moving.

2236
01:42:51,364 --> 01:42:52,797
It's touching, really.

2237
01:42:52,832 --> 01:42:54,060
- Mom, you need to start
focusing

2238
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:56,534
on other things besides me,
like your own life.

2239
01:42:56,569 --> 01:42:57,797
- We need to talk, son.

2240
01:42:57,837 --> 01:42:59,361
- God, if I could focus
on my art

2241
01:42:59,406 --> 01:43:00,600
Iike you focus on me,

2242
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:01,971
I'd be Picasso by now.

2243
01:43:02,008 --> 01:43:04,738
Besides, what's waiting
for me in L.A., Mom?

2244
01:43:12,385 --> 01:43:15,149
Okay, look, Mom, there's this
show I got to do in Kassel

2245
01:43:15,188 --> 01:43:17,884
in like, I don't know,
two months or so.

2246
01:43:17,924 --> 01:43:20,051
And it's big, okay;
it's really big.

2247
01:43:20,093 --> 01:43:22,118
But then maybe sometime
after that,

2248
01:43:22,162 --> 01:43:24,323
I can start thinking about
when I can visit.

2249
01:43:24,364 --> 01:43:25,490
Is that okay?

2250
01:43:27,801 --> 01:43:29,496
Is that all right?

2251
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:30,525
- I love you.

2252
01:43:30,570 --> 01:43:32,629
- But is that all right?

2253
01:43:32,672 --> 01:43:35,800
Mom, I said I'll try to visit
you as soon as I can.

2254
01:43:38,111 --> 01:43:42,878
Is that all right?

2255
01:43:42,916 --> 01:43:45,851
- You see, brothers and sisters,
our hero, the fiery pilgrim,

2256
01:43:45,885 --> 01:43:50,322
never saw the point of love
without understanding.

2257
01:43:50,356 --> 01:43:51,516
- How 'bout now?

- One last piece
of house business.

2264
01:44:06,773 --> 01:44:09,708
I'm pleased to announce
that my seven-hour composition

Shower Hum Song is finished.

2266

- Put the needle on the record.

2267
01:44:13,847 --> 01:44:15,075
- Not so fast.

2268
01:44:15,115 --> 01:44:16,776
I've decided to unveil it
on Christmas Day.

2269
01:44:16,816 --> 01:44:17,805
- Christmas Day?

2270
01:44:17,851 --> 01:44:18,875
- Are you completely crazy?

2271
01:44:18,918 --> 01:44:20,510
- I know, I know,
how embarrassingly

2272
01:44:20,553 --> 01:44:22,680
Judeo-Christian of me.

2273
01:44:22,722 --> 01:44:24,690
But it's not about
a stupid holiday.

2274
01:44:24,724 --> 01:44:26,851
It's about how I feel.

2275
01:44:26,893 --> 01:44:29,828
Just being here is like
Christmas to me.

2276
01:44:29,863 --> 01:44:31,057
And the song is just something

2277
01:44:31,097 --> 01:44:33,725
for us to listen to
while we party.

2278
01:44:33,766 --> 01:44:36,166
- No one is here for Christmas.

2279
01:44:36,202 --> 01:44:38,568
- We all go home
for ze holidays.

2280
01:44:42,942 --> 01:44:44,273
- Home?

2281
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:48,974
- To our families in their
sleepy West German villages.

2282
01:44:49,015 --> 01:44:51,415
- I am missing
my stupid old friends.

2283
01:44:51,451 --> 01:44:54,249
- I cannot wait to lay around
with my teddy bears.

2284
01:44:55,922 --> 01:44:57,856
- I love the look
on my father's face

2285
01:44:57,891 --> 01:45:00,382
when he serves
the blood sausages.

He remembers how I loved them
as a child

into a state of mind
which somehow transforms

what you once could not stand
about your family

2292

- So what, you're just
leaving me here all alone?

be caught dead

01:45:38,364 --> 01:45:39,592
in my backwards little village.

2298
01:45:39,632 --> 01:45:41,566
- With her backwards
little parents.

2299
01:45:41,601 --> 01:45:42,863
- It would be a nightmare
for you.

2300
01:45:42,902 --> 01:45:44,529
- It would be a nightmare
for your parents.

2301
01:45:44,571 --> 01:45:46,368
- Well, why isn't your backwards
little village

2302
01:45:46,406 --> 01:45:47,395
a nightmare for you?

2303
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:49,169
- Why do you think I left?
- I know why you left.

2304
01:45:49,209 --> 01:45:51,177
I'm just trying to figure out
why you're going back.

2305
01:45:51,211 --> 01:45:53,577
- One week out of the year
I see my family.

2306
01:45:53,613 --> 01:45:55,945
I'm sorry, but I don't want
to take you.

2307
01:45:55,982 --> 01:45:57,313
- What, you think I give a fuck

2308
01:45:57,350 --> 01:45:59,409
about your little
redneck village?

2309
01:45:59,452 --> 01:46:00,885
I just don't know why
you'd choose it

2310
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:02,182
over spending Christmas with me.

2311
01:46:02,222 --> 01:46:06,215

It's Christmas.

2313

- Well, hey, I guess it's
just me and you, home skillet.

We'll hold the fort down.

Come, Hugo.

2319
01:46:32,085 --> 01:46:34,383
Come view my new

- Why should I want
to see your-

01:46:35,722 --> 01:46:39,715
- Come see the goddamn
miniskirt!

after the revolution.

[bright piano riff]

2324

- So much for me understanding
the geography of your hell.

- When I visit my parents,
I barely speak.

There's an ocean between us.

2327
01:47:18,431 --> 01:47:22,128
They don't know who I am
or what I am doing.

2328
01:47:22,168 --> 01:47:25,660
And they will never,
ever understand me.

2329
01:47:25,705 --> 01:47:28,105
- So why be with people
that don't understand you?

2330
01:47:28,141 --> 01:47:29,438
- Because they love me.

2331
01:47:29,475 --> 01:47:32,876
- But that seven-hour piece
was written for you.

2332
01:47:32,912 --> 01:47:35,312
- I don't want to be a song.

2333
01:47:35,348 --> 01:47:36,645
I want to be loved.

2334
01:47:40,153 --> 01:47:42,348
And you don't know
the difference.

2335
01:47:52,665 --> 01:47:58,467
If you would like to learn
the difference, I'll stay.

2336
01:48:00,039 --> 01:48:03,406
- It's not love
if somebody has to change.

2337
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:16,111
- Okay.

2338
