00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,155
. .others,
their mouths watering,

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,191
pull off their veils and cry.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,196
They scratch their aching bodies
that shiver and shake,

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,756
crushing the flowers
and biting the grass.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,596
Then they laugh like lunatics,

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,756
up to the stars.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,956
At long last !

9
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,955
Come in !

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,473
Welcome !

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,115
Come on !

12
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,230
Can I help you
take off your cloak ?

13
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,678
Can I get you a drink ?

14
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,436
I got
your favourite champagne ready.

15
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,836
Drink it, Mistress.

16
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,513
Nice !

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,871
Did you hurt your hand ?
Did you get a boo-boo ?

18
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,116
Not that one !

19
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,995
Do it again, please !

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,830
Thank you, yes...
Again !

21
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,988
Wonderful, yes !

22
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,159
What are you doing ?

23
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,556
Open the door !

24
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,793
Why won't it open ?

25
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,116
Hello, inspector.

26
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,031
What did I do ?
I'm innocent !

27
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,869
..he got a hooker every night
and you've never seen him ?

28
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,036
- You haven't either ?
- I haven't.

29
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,549
- You didn't see anything ?
- I didn't see shit !

30
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,671
That's what I expected !

31
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,235
This is serious,
it isn't the usual roundup !

32
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,431
- Thanks !
- No problem, Bonbon.

33
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,838
Do you know this man ?
His name was Mattia Grandi.

34
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,631
I've never seen
a guy with eyes like that.

35
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,918
They're sticking out of the sockets
because he was strangled.

36
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,792
Imagine him
with a normal face.

37
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,478
- That's Lollipop !
- What does that mean ?

38
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,595
He liked
licking feet, legs...

39
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,794
Leave out the details,
did you ever have him ?

40
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,195
No, I'm in the lesbian department.

41
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,109
He hung out at
the S&M fetish area in Porta Volta.

42
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,828
- Where are the Porta Volta girls ?
- Over there !

43
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,033
And here are the specifics,
someone talk to the chauffeur.

44
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,915
Whatever, whatever !

45
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,396
Lo Menzo ! What are you doing ?
Get here on time !

46
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,878
Who's on
the bank kidnapping ?

47
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,548
Franconi and Scarpa
do kidnappings.

48
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,878
Just perfect ! And if I may ask...

49
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,674
what are you working on ?

50
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,836
To be specific,
two recent homicides.

51
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,989
Which ones ?
There've been seven in the last day.

52
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,389
Laura Falconieri and Mattia Grandi.

53
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,556
- I'm throwing this out.
- What's this ?

54
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,312
Kid's stuff.
A book of fables and illustrations.

55
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,676
Do I have time for illustrations ?

56
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,836
Well, our killer does.

57
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,112
It was found with
Falconieri's body.

58
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,753
There's another one.

59
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,030
This was with Grandi's body.

60
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,756
Fine, tell me what it's about.

61
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,793
The illustrations
are on pages 1 0 and 1 7.

62
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,673
He cut them out
from another book.

63
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,718
A 1 9th century children's classic:
''Shock-Headed Peter''.

64
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,958
You did some
very thorough research but...

65
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,752
tell me what it means.

66
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,033
How would I know ?
I haven't come to a conclusion.

67
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,515
But the two murders are related.

68
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,430
- The killer left...
- His business card !

69
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,359
He's trying to distinguish himself.

70
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,713
He steals nothing,
there's no apparent motive.

71
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,875
Why did he kill someone ?

72
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,438
- You're asking me ?
- Excuse me but I think...

73
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,438
..the two cases
can be included

74
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,596
in the category of sex crimes

75
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,668
which are a result
of our overly permissive society !

76
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,715
I think the killer is a lunatic

77
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,997
who has a strong
subconscious desire to be arrested.

78
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,668
As all criminals are,

79
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,199
according to Freudian theory.

80
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,397
- Who are you ?
- Mario Lombardozzi, convict.

81
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,230
- Bye, Lo Menzo.
- Bye.

82
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,792
- Have a good day.
- Good night, you mean.

83
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,512
I met a foxy chick
in the elevator.

84
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,075
- Foxier than me ?
- That's impossible.

85
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,559
What's for dinner ?

86
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,435
Curried rice,
soy and bean sprouts.

87
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,156
This macrobiotic cooking
is a drag.

88
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,828
It's better than
your spaghetti

89
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,474
with clams and cholera,
you Southern hick !

90
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,558
You jungle bunny !
If I'm a hick, what are you ?

91
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,716
A descendent from
a clan of kings.

92
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,270
You're the queen
so kiss your white slave.

93
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,188
Let's just go in the other room...

94
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,040
I've got some new tricks,
I get on the bottom and...

95
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,119
You animal !
You're worse than a black man !

96
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,596
Eat something and if I want to,
we can have sex.

97
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,636
Now teach me
the new tricks you learned.

98
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,320
A link between
the two victims exists.

99
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,557
They are members and
founders of this club:

100
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,796
The Fauna Lovers Club.

101
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,719
Four or five years ago,
if you remember.

102
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,876
No, I was in Rome.
What is it ?

103
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,150
An association
of animal lovers

104
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,715
that collected
endangered species.

105
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,791
They were also into
hash and other drugs.

106
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,956
So more flora than fauna.

107
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,869
Inspector Del Re from Como
filed a report on it.

108
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,160
It's in the archive, I'll get it.

109
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,236
Here it is.

110
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,515
Yes, Fauna Lovers Club.

111
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,156
Here.

112
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,716
It's empty.

113
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,436
- Donati !
- Here I am !

114
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,716
Here I am !

115
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,388
What's happened ?

116
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,591
This folder is empty !

117
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,713
- The papers must have fallen out.
- Someone did it on purpose !

118
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,150
Please don't do anything to me !

119
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,156
- It wasn't me !
- Well, it was someone !

120
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,430
And that person must pay !

121
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,598
Careless lazy bums !
Slackers !

122
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,592
Prick.

123
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,434
So my wife is cheating on me !

124
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,076
- The pictures prove it.
- How embarrassing.

125
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,396
How humiliating.

126
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,910
She's never done those things
with me, that slut !

127
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,475
But what a great body !

128
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,638
- What do you think ?
- I guess so.

129
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,754
And she's so photogenic.

130
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,591
How did you get
such good quality pictures ?

131
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,076
With little cameras
hidden in her lover's home.

132
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,671
Look at that ass !
And her tits, they're so slutty !

133
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,034
- Can I keep these ?
- Yes, it's included in the price.

134
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,236
Because this is important.

135
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,309
- Can I go now ?
- Of course.

136
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,799
- Pandolfi, can you come in here ?
- Straight away.

137
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,599
- Beautiful... and beastly !
- Beat it, shrimp.

138
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,071
Forget I said that.

139
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,950
Scanavini, let me introduce
my closest collaborator: Pandolfi.

140
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:45,556
Pandolfi, please record
Mr Scanavini's and my conversation.

141
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,274
Why ? I was hoping for
a private meeting.

142
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,234
We can trust Pandolfi.

143
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,319
I assure you
no one will hear this recording.

144
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,836
Here is the microphone.

145
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,391
- I've come to you...
- Just a moment.

146
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,436
- Now you can talk.
- I've come to you...

147
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,793
Speak louder.

148
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,591
I've come to you,
Mr Struwwel, because...

149
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,635
Two friends of mine,
Mattia Grandi and Laura Falconieri

150
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,236
were murdered recently.

151
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,516
And ?

152
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,512
- The cops are groping in the dark...
- As usual !

153
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,673
I suspect that...

154
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,550
their deaths
have something to do with...

155
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,955
Villa Hoffmann.

156
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,596
Villa Hoffmann ?

157
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,795
That doesn't ring a bell.

158
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,830
What happened ?

159
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,478
- You don't remember ?
- No.

160
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,315
Four years ago, in that villa...

161
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,399
We were all there and a girl...

162
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,199
..died.

163
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,432
''Fauna Club Investigation:
leads nowhere.''

164
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,155
Hello ?
So you're Giotto !

165
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,393
They know nothing in Rome,
no records at the Hall of Justice.

166
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,433
Tell me about this Inspector Del Re.

167
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,712
Stop screaming,
you're hurting my ear !

168
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,992
He resigned ?
He disappeared from Como ?

169
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,715
Keep an eye on the brothel owners,
follow the Porta Volta lead.

170
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,434
Get the pimps to talk.
The bus !

171
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,315
Why has Bucciarelli been gone
for an hour and not 1 0 minutes ?

172
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,670
Huh ?
All right, bye.

173
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,996
Well ? I'm interested
in what you're saying.

174
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,076
I've told you everything.

175
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,510
I can't say anymore.

176
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,476
Don't kid around,
tell me everything.

177
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,434
- Do we have a deal or not ?
- They're secrets, I can't tell you.

178
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,710
It would be unprofessional.

179
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,036
I'll get you closed down.

180
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,435
What you do is illegal,
you know that ?

181
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,111
I don't run
some third-rate casino.

182
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,550
Gambling's illegal but
casinos are tolerated, you know why ?

183
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,592
Because the state
gets a few cents out of it.

184
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,715
- You've given money to the state ?
- Not much, I admit.

185
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,390
But my work
helps you out, and quite a bit.

186
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,276
My equipment,
the information, the favours.

187
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,509
You've made use of my files,

188
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,712
my international acquaintances,

189
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,071
my electronic equipment...

190
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,636
Equipment
that would cost the state

191
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:05,118
as much as one year
of police and carabinieri budgets.

192
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,670
I don't like this equipment.

193
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,836
I'll confiscate it, it's illegal.

194
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,311
It's against the law
to simply follow someone !

195
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,039
Well, so is smoking
smuggled cigarettes.

196
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,509
That's not as serious.

197
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,550
You know what the most amazing
piece of equipment is here ?

198
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,709
The most safe and efficient ?

199
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,277
Here it is, the phone !

200
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,075
You have to know how to use it.

201
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,431
This gives someone power.
A telephone.

202
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,598
Just 2, 3 or 5 telephones

203
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,155
and you can control
an entire city.

204
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,556
- Sure... The country, the world !
- That's right, my friend.

205
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,070
If they work.
I always get an engaged tone.

206
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,958
I have a meeting soon, follow me.

207
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,876
Come back tomorrow
and I promise to give you

208
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,435
a nice amount of information.

209
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,358
Those illustrations
found by the victims...

210
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,199
Do you know
where they come from ?

211
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,359
That awful German book:
''Shock-Headed Peter''.

212
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,793
That's right...
What's the author's name ?

213
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,434
Hoffmann !

214
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,599
Villa Hoffmann, perhaps
the similarity is intentional.

215
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,552
Or perhaps not.

216
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,478
Whatever happened to Hoffmann ?

217
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,310
- The author or the villa ?
- The owner of the villa.

218
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,912
He died from a brain haemorrhage
in Amsterdam.

219
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,919
No one
in Milan has ever seen the body.

220
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,749
And all of his friends
have gone missing.

221
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,195
There we are.

222
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,075
Oh really ?

223
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,039
How is my mommy dearest ?

224
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,751
How do you think,
you little asshole ?

225
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,550
She'll sleep tonight.

226
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,072
Dear mother...

227
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,470
That's Picozzi !

228
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,078
If the judges
looked into all the dirty money,

229
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,158
arrest warrants would be sent
all over Italy !

230
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,268
- Angelo !
- Yes, mommy dearest ?

231
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,870
Mommy dearest !
Picozzi is on the TV !

232
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,197
- Ernesto ! Remember him ?
- That dickhead !

233
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,075
- Remove one of these pillows.
- Yes, mommy dearest.

234
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,792
Now mommy dearest
is taking a nap.

235
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,756
- Goodnight.
- Where's the maid ?

236
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,076
In the toilet, I think.

237
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,518
Two crimes are in the spotlight.

238
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,076
The killer leaves
illustrations by the bodies.

239
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,512
Two newspapers have already made
unusual hypotheses about you.

240
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,996
They say you're involved.
How and why ?

241
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,479
My implication
in this grotesque affair

242
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,671
is completely false.

243
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,270
But I'd like to summarize
the situation anyway.

244
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,995
It's getting
more and more frightening.

245
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,674
Miss ?

246
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,993
Miss ?

247
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,591
I'm leaving, goodbye.

248
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,268
Is someone picking you up ?

249
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,955
If I may, I'll...

250
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,435
Don't worry, it's just the alarm.

251
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,279
Nowadays...
a girl by herself at night.

252
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,512
- A pretty girl like you...
- Goodnight.

253
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,076
Look at that twit Picozzi !

254
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,589
. .any attempt to charge me. . .

255
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,192
Now the light's going out.

256
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,755
But I already have here
an apology letter.

257
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,838
One editor-in-chief
wants me to withdraw the charges. . .

258
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,877
- What happened ?
- He's been shot !

259
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,036
Okay, off the air !

260
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,795
Mommy dearest !

261
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,188
Can't you feel the beat ?

262
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,630
I don't feel like it anymore.

263
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,710
A whisky, please.

264
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,111
Come here,
stop being silly.

265
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,630
- I saw a blacker arm than yours.
- What do you mean ?

266
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,669
- Ever heard of Joan of Arc ?
- The queen who was burned alive.

267
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,958
She wasn't a queen,
but she was burned alive.

268
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,913
- Do you know that girl ?
- Yes. Do you like her ?

269
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,038
Who are you ?

270
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,789
This is one of
the top photographers around.

271
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,999
Evelyn Christie ?
It's you ! What a pretty lady !

272
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,272
Evelyn is a man's name !

273
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,997
- What floor ?
- Sorry ?

274
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,555
Don't you remember ?
In the elevator ?

275
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,435
- The girl who was following me !
- You were following me.

276
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,070
But I've never...
could I have this dance ?

277
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,716
- Aren't you with someone ?
- A girl but...

278
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,990
She's left me for Evelyn !

279
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,555
- Who's off beat ? Us or them ?
- Them, of course.

280
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,990
Music is such a romantic thing.

281
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,760
Then recite a poem
from Apollinaire for me.

282
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,995
- What an awful accent !
- I do my best.

283
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,273
- Who are you ?
- Jeanne. Want to know more ?

284
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,630
No, that's all.

285
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,037
- Why don't we leave ?
- I'm with friends.

286
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,470
If your friends even try to take you
away from me, I'll sock them one !

287
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,355
- I'm terrible when I'm angry !
- Shall we dance, Jeanne ?

288
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,073
A typical underworld crime.
We shouldn't stray too much.

289
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,672
The classic punishment
of a disobedient hooker.

290
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,118
Regarding Miss La Meniconi's case,

291
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,710
there's no connection
with the fairy tale murderer,

292
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:02,239
who by the way
just killed someone on TV.

293
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,792
I was thinking about La Meniconi.

294
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,072
She was suspected
of killing Mattia Grandi.

295
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,956
Suspected, to say the least.

296
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,948
The report shows that
the fingerprints on Grandi's neck

297
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,869
were compared to La Meniconi's
and they match.

298
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,918
So there's no doubt:
she's the killer.

299
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,429
The fairy tale killer !

300
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,232
- It's quite obvious !
- What if it were two people ?

301
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,038
- What are you talking about ?
- It could be.

302
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,238
One of them kills while
the other leaves the illustration.

303
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,957
Before we are swamped
with tons of hypotheses,

304
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,550
let's consider
the unbelievable murder of Picozzi.

305
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,911
He was killed on live TV
in front of millions of people.

306
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,751
The station staff were questioned

307
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,918
but nothing was found
against them.

308
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,755
- Who are they ?
- Gianna Bartegazzi.

309
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,679
Fiorenza Cartelli...

310
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,036
Ruth told me about you,
she said you're a policeman.

311
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,108
A cop, a pig, a bobby.

312
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,276
You could say that.

313
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,631
She also said you're
not like everyone else.

314
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,798
- Am I better or worse ?
- What do you think ?

315
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,553
The police is like all places,
there are honest people too.

316
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,990
I couldn't stand being
at the station on a Sunday.

317
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,316
This was nice of you.

318
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,751
- Ruth told me...
- Stop talking about Ruth !

319
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,669
- She cheated on me with a white guy.
- Aren't you white ?

320
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,871
I'm Neapolitan, that's different.

321
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,868
Who said Naples is the only African
city with no European quarter ?

322
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,036
A Neapolitan, of course.

323
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,915
- Did you see that ?
- What ?

324
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,875
Those two
performing obscene acts in public.

325
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,238
- Like two cats.
- Two rabbits.

326
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,910
- Why don't you arrest them ?
- I'm on their side.

327
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,995
Look, why did you
ask me to come with you ?

328
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,910
To eat fish by the lake.

329
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,638
- So this is Villa Hoffmann ?
- Yes.

330
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,917
- Forget it, it's locked.
- Let's climb over here.

331
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,915
Climb ? That's a serious crime !

332
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,236
Come on, Inspector. Jump.

333
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,116
Bloody hell !

334
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,750
What's so funny ?
Give me your hand.

335
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,238
- You're afraid, aren't you ?
- No !

336
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,676
Are you hurt ?

337
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,318
Hoffmann was a big traveller.
He got animals from everywhere.

338
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,479
Then he sold everything,
went to Amsterdam and died.

339
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,118
What did The Fauna Lovers do ?

340
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,074
Nothing with animals.
They'd meet here on Saturdays.

341
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,311
Look ! Poor thing.

342
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,318
I wonder who feeds him.

343
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,712
- How many times have you been here ?
- Just once.

344
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:51,431
I was invited and
and figured everything out too late.

345
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,477
What are you looking at ?

346
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,752
Now let's do something more serious.

347
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,878
All men follow me.
Come on, gentlemen.

348
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,880
The men sit over there.

349
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,432
Come on, Mattia !

350
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,676
Where do we go ?

351
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,872
The ladies sit on the couch.

352
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,311
This is a fun game
I learned in Hong Kong.

353
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,512
You, put some music on now !

354
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,795
Rosa, come here.
Now you...

355
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,072
Under the table,
like I told you...

356
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,592
Don't be silly,
this is why you're here.

357
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,834
Go on !

358
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,953
The girl's name was Rosa.
Rosa Capena.

359
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,153
A hooker
who spiced up the evenings.

360
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,670
Her pimp used to bring her
then pick her up later

361
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,030
along with his compensation.

362
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,951
It's Mattia, that stud !

363
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,872
He's moaning and groaning !

364
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,834
Of course it's him !

365
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,793
No, I'm the lucky one !

366
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,748
You're all wrong !
Mattia and I set it up.

367
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,432
- Good job.
- Let's do it again !

368
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,633
It's time for a break.

369
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,197
I'm no longer a young chap,
as you know.

370
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,231
But this time,
I'm going under the table !

371
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:11,392
Do you want me ? You do ?
Then here I go !

372
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,150
- Nice group of friends !
- Nothing special.

373
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,158
Things like that go on everywhere.

374
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,830
But then
the alcohol started to hit at dawn.

375
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,194
- And then...
- Then what ?

376
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,998
Why ?
Let me go ! Let me go !

377
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,596
Are you ready ?

378
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,990
She passed out !

379
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,474
She's dead.

380
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,556
Then Rosa's pimp, Agostino,
came to get her.

381
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,112
Hoffmann told him the story
they made up.

382
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,154
That Rosa died of a heart attack
in the lounge.

383
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,629
Agostino Farundi.
Born in Barletta, 4 July 1 940.

384
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,479
Elementary school.
Reformatory.

385
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,832
At 1 4 he ran away to Turin.
Motorcycle theft and drug dealing.

386
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,550
A 3-year sentence, two pardons.

387
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,838
In the drug and prostitution market.

388
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,270
Hospitalised for tuberculosis.

389
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,434
Corrupting a minor in Milan in 1 960.
Acquitted.

390
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,108
Indicted again for drug dealing.

391
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,313
- Do it, you pig !
- You're my little whore !

392
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,918
You weren't supposed to hear that...
Well, this Farundi !

393
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,076
A born criminal.

394
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,558
There's no such thing !
You're still hooked on Lombroso.

395
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,752
- Who's Lombroso ?
- Forget it.

396
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:38,033
How can someone
who lived through injustice

397
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,196
understand what justice is ?

398
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,312
- Are you a communist ?
- What does that matter ?

399
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,954
He didn't kill Grandi,

400
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,958
his new girl to protect did,
La Melinconi.

401
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,675
She was killed by Farundi
so she wouldn't confess.

402
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,359
This was her last place of residence.

403
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,677
- Does Agostino Farundi live here ?
- I don't know anything.

404
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,678
Nice place !
I bet they charge rent too.

405
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,954
Birdie, birdie,

406
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,673
be careful when the hunter's round.

407
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,031
He'll lock you up for good !

408
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,596
May I ?

409
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,272
- Was that you singing ?
- Do I look like Mina ?

410
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:59,310
Do you know Agostino Farundi ?
Does he live here ?

411
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,869
- I live here !
- I meant in the building.

412
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,913
It's a big place,
people come and go.

413
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,878
By the way, who are you ?
What are you doing in my house ?

414
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,673
I'm trying to do my make-up !

415
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,678
- Watch your mouth !
- Look, we...

416
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,111
We're friends of his, it's business.

417
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,757
Friends, are you ?

418
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:28,596
I'd like to help, you're so nice.
But how can I ?

419
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,635
This Agostino...

420
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,915
- Who was that ?
- I know no one here.

421
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,711
I keep to myself
and they keep to themselves.

422
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,956
I'm going to slap you one !

423
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,592
You can't touch civilians.
Go read the constitution !

424
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,279
Forget it, we just want
to talk to Agostino.

425
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,830
Get out, I have to get dressed.

426
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,079
- What if we don't ?
- I'll change anyway !

427
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,632
- Cover yourself ! Let's go !
- Why ?

428
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,359
- But wait...
- Get going !

429
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,476
- Come on !
- I'm coming !

430
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,956
I want to look around.

431
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,913
Look over there.

432
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,516
There's a book here.

433
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,918
This reveals all !
He even wrote his name on it !

434
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,472
''Farundi Agostino, San Vittore Prison,
Summer 1 967.'' He lives here.

435
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,638
- Call the station.
- We could wait for him.

436
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,196
And have him make us coffee ?
The girl's singing was a warning !

437
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,197
Then he left on his bike.

438
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,190
- Let's arrest her.
- For what ? Illegal singing ?

439
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,556
Wake up, dunce.

440
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,515
- Haircut and shave.
- Right away !

441
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,508
Check the fluids and oil,
there's no stopping before Munich.

442
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,837
Beloved Italy, go fuck yourself !

443
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,112
Holy shit !

444
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,309
- Wait !
- Screw you !

445
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:16,478
Wait, wait !

446
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:34,236
This killer is versatile.
He steals trucks, buses...

447
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,431
- Shoots on TV.
- He's everywhere, who is he ?

448
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,792
So much for macrobiotic food !

449
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,196
Tomato...

450
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,796
Disgusting...

451
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,476
Cheese.

452
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:22,190
- Hello, Inspector.
- Keep the change.

453
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,355
- You know we're closed tomorrow ?
- So what ?

454
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,516
Bye.

455
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,150
- Holy cow !
- Who, me ?

456
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:49,231
No, but that's not how
you walk in someone's house.

457
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,394
I didn't think
cops were so jumpy.

458
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,954
Now you know.

459
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,675
All that wine wasted !

460
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,432
Ruth left, she's in England.

461
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,399
- She left me this.
- She ran off with Evelyn.

462
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,791
- So ?
- That's all.

463
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,151
I'm upstairs and I couldn't sleep.
I was afraid.

464
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,038
- Afraid of...
- Yep.

465
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:21,028
- So you're seeking refuge...
- With a bigger scaredy-cat than me.

466
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,954
I'm not afraid !

467
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,196
I'm just a little nervous.

468
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,349
I don't sleep enough.

469
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,474
If you have to leave...

470
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,917
If you want to stay, stay.
Since you're...

471
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,914
That was my plan.

472
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,993
But before I go to sleep,
I usually have sex.

473
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,273
- So do I.
- So casual, I like that.

474
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,473
- But before we have sex...
- You mean...

475
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,272
I like it...

476
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,350
- This way ?
- Yes.

477
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,793
No !

478
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,836
- What's with you ?
- I have to make a phone call.

479
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,708
- Who to ?
- Sigrid.

480
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,437
- A girlfriend of mine.
- Right now ?

481
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,950
I've been kind of weird lately.

482
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,391
I need to have this friend
nearby in times like this.

483
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,356
You want her nearby ?

484
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,719
- We can call her later.
- As you wish.

485
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,879
But you have to be affectionate.
Kiss me hard.

486
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,993
- So when did it happen ?
- What ?

487
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,954
- Rosa's death.
- November 30.

488
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,274
Today's date.
Where is she buried ?

489
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,756
- Who ?
- Rosa Catena.

490
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,951
I don't know.

491
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,836
I'll find out.
Go back to sleep, I'm leaving.

492
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,468
Bye.

493
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,835
Agostino Farundi ! Don't move !

494
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,876
Who's moving ?

495
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,916
You pimps sure are soppy !

496
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,634
Visiting her grave
the day she died !

497
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,109
The first time you could
after all those years in jail.

498
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,630
What are you arresting me for ?
What did I do ?

499
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,796
They taught us this in catechism,
visit the dead.

500
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,318
They also say do not kill.
So stick with the rules.

501
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,190
- Are you setting me up ?
- You set yourself up.

502
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,391
4 murders !

503
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,991
Pasting their obituaries
in a notebook, that's evidence !

504
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,558
I was only glad they died !

505
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:22,078
They killed Rosa !
I'm innocent, let me go !

506
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,355
Now where are you going to go ?

507
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,796
Wait !

508
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,552
That's enough !
Will you stop being so stupid ?

509
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,956
Put that shovel down !

510
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,715
Come here...

511
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,595
These cutlets come from
the new machine.

512
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:32,275
I can almost taste
the artificial colouring.

513
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,237
Maybe the recipe isn't perfect yet.

514
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,908
We raised the temperature.
Tomorrow...

515
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,112
Whatever, just make sure
you check it out.

516
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,909
FAIRY TALE KILLER CAUGHT
NIGHTMARE OVER

517
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:58,269
- It washes out with water.
- I know !

518
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,789
That's good, okay.

519
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,269
That's good, okay.

520
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,038
Stand still, Sigrid !
Turn around, Sheila !

521
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,436
Smile !

522
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,510
Freeze !
Freeze Sheila !

523
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,754
Look over her, Jeanne.

524
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:33,394
Jeanne and Sigrid are done.
You stay on, Sheila.

525
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,549
Turn sideways.

526
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,111
Don't move !

527
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,912
- Wait !
- I didn't mean to interrupt.

528
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:08,309
- Wait, please.
- I'm no voyeur.

529
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:12,071
Just make love and be happy.

530
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,069
Stay here, slave boy !

531
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,954
- Wait !
- How dare she call me slave boy ?

532
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,594
- Why ?
- I wouldn't mind a threesome.

533
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,473
Of course I wouldn't !

534
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:34,639
But no one in love
likes to see that stuff.

535
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,798
- You're in love with me ?
- Yes.

536
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,116
But pretend I never told you.

537
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,117
You coming here so late
isn't really appropriate.

538
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,551
- But we won't tell anyone.
- No.

539
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,035
What's that ?

540
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:02,996
Slavery:
handcuffs and Cavour's glasses.

541
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,752
But these were considered modern
in Cavour's day.

542
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,997
Have a seat.

543
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:22,030
I'm going to show you something,
then we can leave.

544
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,359
I looked into the Villa Hoffmann case
you told me about.

545
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,072
I checked the list
of wild animals.

546
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,478
It goes on and on.
For example...

547
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,199
There was a tiger there.

548
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,150
Can you believe that ?

549
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,670
- Jeanne !
- I told you there was.

550
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,718
He had a lot of tigers.

551
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:55,198
- It says it's from Kenya.
- So ?

552
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,109
Tigers come from Asia, not Africa.

553
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,118
This one might have immigrated.

554
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:06,871
You can buy tigers in Africa
like you can in Hamburg.

555
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:11,471
I looked into it:
telegrams, phone calls...

556
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,798
Hoffmann caught
a lion in Kenya.

557
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:20,831
- But it died during the trip.
- Poor thing ! Big old cat !

558
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,232
Right, and I always pet them
on my lap !

559
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,592
I pet them all over
and kick them in the ass !

560
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,275
The lion died and he went to Tunis.

561
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,155
- Do you know anything about that ?
- No.

562
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:40,069
I wasn't with him that time.
We weren't really friends.

563
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,400
He came back to Italy

564
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,717
and there was
a live tiger in the cage.

565
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,030
There's nothing odd,
in Algiers...

566
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,312
- Tunis.
- Right... Tunis.

567
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,195
Maybe he just had
to buy an animal !

568
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:01,157
I know, I always feel so lost
without one !

569
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,190
I was hoping
you'd give me some explanation.

570
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,478
There's nothing weird about it.

571
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:13,276
Maybe he had a deal
with a zoo or a circus.

572
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:17,439
- He just had to get one.
- Let's go, I'm tired.

573
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,437
I don't feel so great.

574
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,438
- We caught the killer !
- Good job !

575
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,231
So let's celebrate.

576
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,116
Okay, the nightmare is over.

577
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:54,755
The monster's been caught.

578
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:02,797
But what monster ?
Not Agostino because...

579
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,756
it's someone else.

580
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,078
I have to get to the bottom of this.
There is a lead...

581
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,875
Inspector Del Re,
who was forced to resign

582
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,793
and he disappeared and was
maybe killed, remember ?

583
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,916
Yes, vaguely.

584
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,870
Did you find his reports ?

585
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,872
Not many of them.

586
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:36,232
The reports involving
high-level people are missing.

587
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:40,479
Someone interested got there first
and ripped them up like this !

588
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,117
- Hey !
- Sorry.

589
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,993
Get on it and
keep me informed.

590
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,510
- Don't worry, I will.
- Good.

591
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,158
It's an obsession,
I won't go out alone anymore.

592
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:00,399
- We need protection !
- I have just the people.

593
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,157
Stake out the homes
of these clients.

594
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,875
Monitor doors and windows
and follow them everywhere.

595
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:14,472
- Who are these men ?
- One is an ex-cop.

596
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,115
The other is an ex-killer.

597
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:24,239
Don't worry, I've redeemed them
of their past crimes.

598
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,110
Now tell me...

599
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:34,078
how did you meet Mr Hoffmann ?

600
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,839
I love animals.

601
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:41,677
He started Fauna Lovers.

602
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,635
I know, he organized
safaris in Africa.

603
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,476
I went a few times.

604
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:52,355
We hunted panthers,
lions and elephants.

605
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:59,195
- That's strange for an animal lover.
- Why ? We didn't kill them.

606
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:03,029
They'd tranquillise them
with special bullets.

607
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,837
They'd bring them here
to sell at circuses and zoos.

608
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,509
That's still strange
for animal lovers.

609
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,757
What does this have to do
with our problem ?

610
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:18,559
As the cop always says,
I ask the questions.

611
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,113
What else do you want to know ?

612
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,717
We'd better proceed with caution.

613
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,993
I can't get upset,
I have high blood pressure.

614
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,110
Drinking and eating chocolates
will be the end of you !

615
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,596
They're just little comforts,
little joys of life.

616
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,679
If you want to be rude,
I can play too.

617
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:46,673
You, for instance !
This is a valuable ring !

618
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:53,029
- Was it a gift ?
- Yes... no ! I bought it.

619
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,117
Very big and very pure.

620
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:02,196
Have you ever been
on a safari in South Africa ?

621
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,631
- What kind of question is that ?
- Have you ?

622
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:16,638
It's a nice place
if you're white.

623
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,236
Inspector Del Re !
He lived here.

624
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,994
- Can I see his room ?
- There's nothing in it.

625
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,317
Not even a notebook,
book or old clothes ?

626
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,110
There's a few books.

627
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:38,395
- Can I have a look ?
- It's over there.

628
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,235
Are you fainting ?

629
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,675
She's always wasted.

630
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,316
- At 9 in the morning ?
- All day !

631
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:25,839
I went to Villa Hoffmann
and I'm suspicious about the death. . .

632
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:31,711
It's your right to leave.
Don't let fear take over you.

633
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,912
I'm not afraid,
it's for work.

634
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:38,271
- I'm a model, remember ?
- I know, you all are.

635
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,870
- But you keep dumping me.
- I'm also afraid.

636
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:46,153
Okay, I'm very afraid.
I wouldn't leave you for work.

637
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:49,518
I can still find
another model to sleep with.

638
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,953
Asshole !
Screw you !

639
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,752
I didn't mean that,
I was kidding.

640
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:05,239
Here... it's for you.

641
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,195
I really cared about you.

642
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,108
You should say ''care'' not ''cared''.

643
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,672
- I'll be back and we'll be together.
- Sure.

644
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,756
You'll be back.

645
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:34,918
- I'm taking you.
- Where ?

646
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:38,078
- To the border.
- What about work ?

647
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,316
I'll take care of it.

648
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:44,274
- I don't want to be to blame.
- I am.

649
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:48,400
Come on.

650
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,191
Sorry about the detour,
I need to check on the cages.

651
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,476
What cages ?

652
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:01,077
I'm just curious,
I've got a hunch.

653
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:07,318
- But they're over there !
- I meant these cages here.

654
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,230
- Want a smoke ?
- No.

655
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,520
It's not solid iron,
they're hollow.

656
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:29,315
Solid iron is heavy,
this is easy to take apart.

657
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,432
Nice tube.
A lot of room inside.

658
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,671
- You could fit anything.
- Like what ?

659
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,712
Like diamonds, there are
a lot of them in South Africa.

660
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:46,595
There are animals
and diamonds too.

661
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:50,632
If you put diamonds
and animals together,

662
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:55,789
customs won't get too picky
about a panther in a cage.

663
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,919
And if you want
to hide diamonds in a tube,

664
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:05,272
stick a wild animal in the cage
and you're off scot-free.

665
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,152
What are you talking about ?

666
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:12,432
I just like
making up mystery stories.

667
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:17,350
But there's always
an ending to mysteries.

668
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:22,358
The bad guy always gets caught.

669
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,750
This is a nice place,
a nice isolated villa.

670
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:33,197
Perfect for
Fauna Lovers meetings

671
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,755
that sometimes go wrong.

672
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,076
You can't plan everything.

673
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:42,030
You're making
these crazy ideas up.

674
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:45,393
I told you, I like mysteries.

675
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:48,956
Like that notorious party,
I imagine it differently.

676
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:53,472
That little twist
that can really change things.

677
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,710
Everyone had left by dawn.

678
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,073
Only members of that strange
import-export club were still there.

679
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,111
But someone else
was there too.

680
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:23,278
Two million dollars !

681
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:28,349
They didn't realize
someone was lurking around.

682
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,359
- Rosa's here !
- Hadn't she left ?

683
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:40,879
- What are you doing ?
- Nothing, go back to the lounge.

684
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:01,439
- Let's go inside.
- I don't really care.

685
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,878
I don't care what you do.

686
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:09,119
I'm a friend, aren't I ?
I don't care what you do.

687
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,834
Let's go inside.

688
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:16,153
- What do you want from me ?
- Nothing.

689
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:19,193
Just relax.

690
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,356
You're with friends.

691
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:24,199
Why won't you let me leave ?

692
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,473
Stay here, I'll be right back.

693
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:31,672
What are you worried
might happen to you ?

694
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:38,874
You don't have
to explain to anyone.

695
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,116
I didn't see anything !

696
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:44,357
We believe you,
there was nothing to see.

697
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,672
- One last drink ?
- All right.

698
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:51,031
One for the road.
It will relax you.

699
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:02,159
Let's find
a more comfortable spot.

700
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,276
Have a seat.

701
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,749
Drink up.
Drink up !

702
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,231
- Help me.
- No !

703
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,917
Drink it !
Hold her down.

704
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,679
Here, drink up.

705
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,435
Open your mouth !

706
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,676
And lie still !

707
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:53,271
A little more... a little more.

708
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:59,799
- That's how it went.
- How would you know ?

709
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,037
The police investigate too.

710
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:07,518
The most interesting evidence
disappeared with Del Re.

711
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:11,759
- But I did find some notes...
- You're bluffing.

712
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:15,839
- Where do I fit in all this ?
- You were Hoffmann's lover.

713
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:20,397
- No, I wasn't !
- You helped him to avoid suspicion.

714
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:25,549
Remember when that one stop
was in Algiers and not Tunis ?

715
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:31,355
- What stop ?
- The lion died during the trip.

716
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,518
You got a tiger
to take its place.

717
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:38,030
Or the cage
would be empty at customs.

718
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,755
Then it would be easier
to find the diamonds.

719
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,951
You're insane !

720
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,988
Here I am, Dr Lo Menzo.

721
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,636
You even had the rifle ready.

722
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:56,433
- This was rather imprudent.
- Professional risks.

723
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,796
And I trust your intelligence.

724
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,912
Killing me might get you in trouble.

725
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:05,433
Who would ever know ?
I'm dead.

726
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,951
I left the evidence
in my office.

727
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:12,357
It says you're alive
and I saw you here.

728
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,509
You can't have recognized me.

729
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,913
That was a suspicious
homeless man in the cage.

730
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,953
It wasn't a real tramp.

731
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,151
How could you tell ?

732
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:27,276
His shoes.

733
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:30,392
They were Saxon's. 30,000 liras.

734
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,029
Homeless people don't wear those.

735
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:36,829
Well done, Sherlock.
But I still have no choice.

736
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,236
This wasn't planned.

737
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:44,230
I have to kill you
so I can continue living.

738
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,795
And so it shall be.

739
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,795
They'll know right away.

740
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,829
I know how
to get rid of bodies.

741
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:59,795
My father was in the SS,
he taught me a lot of secrets.

742
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,591
There.

743
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:25,118
You're safe here,
I'll get you an ambulance.

744
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:03,470
- Hi, Hoffmann.
- Who are you ?

745
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:08,151
Peter Struwwel, private detective.
We have friends in common.

746
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:12,797
You can all go to hell.

747
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,838
Don't you want to escape ?

748
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,714
It would be a snap

749
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,036
to break this lock open.

750
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:32,677
You could go back to Amsterdam.

751
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:38,189
But you're legally dead there,
aren't you ?

752
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,870
This makes me sick,
how much do you want ?

753
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:46,232
It was just an idea, that's all.

754
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,473
And plus, you can't leave.

755
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:55,038
All the police want
is to nab your friends' killer.

756
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,831
Leave me alone !

757
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:04,397
- Or kill me.
- That would be pointless.

758
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,797
It would be much more convincing
if you killed yourself.

759
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,151
They'd close the case
straight away.

760
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:15,394
What would I get
out of killing myself ?

761
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:18,390
Ever since you've been in here,

762
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,718
the only thing you've wanted
is to kill yourself.

763
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,674
- You just want to die.
- That's not true !

764
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:29,555
People like you
can't handle trials,

765
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:33,116
you can't stand
the police touching you.

766
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:36,949
You'd never want
to spend your last days in jail.

767
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,632
You'd lose your lucidity.

768
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:44,037
You couldn't stand
the humiliation.

769
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:48,028
Prove you're a better man.

770
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:53,272
- I didn't kill anyone !
- Maybe not your friends.

771
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,518
But Rosa Catena...

772
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:04,070
Yes, you killed her.

773
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,717
Do you want to spend
your life in prison ?

774
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,993
In a dark cell
like one of your animals ?

775
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:22,719
No !
I'm a free man, a hero !

776
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:26,398
Then act like a hero !

777
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,798
This is the key
to your freedom.

778
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,869
Make your wish come true,
fly away like a bird.

779
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,398
I'd kill you first.

780
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,918
That would be cowardly.

781
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,475
A vile, useless act.

782
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:51,073
You have to suffer
to be a hero.

783
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:54,272
But that one word
makes it worth it: Hero !

784
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:59,229
Hero !

785
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,871
Ruth is in England
and Jeanne's in jail.

786
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:49,790
You seem more upset this time.

787
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:53,875
- Are you in love ?
- I don't know.

788
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,036
I had to do my job.

789
01:15:56,240 --> 01:16:00,711
- She saved you, that counts in trial.
- I hope so.

790
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:05,197
- Do you like Rachmaninov ?
- Sort of.

791
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:08,757
- Schumann ?
- Well...

792
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:11,754
- Do you like classical music ?
- No.

793
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:14,110
Just fuck off.

794
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:18,108
We've got a good start:
we uncovered diamond smugglers

795
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,595
and how Rosa Catena died.

796
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,588
- We arrested Farundi.
- Who has nothing to do with it.

797
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,395
Don't forget
we don't know who the killer is.

798
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:31,228
I'm so confused.

799
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:35,433
It's not Agostino or Hoffmann.
The French girl...

800
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:38,313
It's not Jeanne !

801
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:41,512
- She's not involved in the murders !
- Okay !

802
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:44,951
- Then who is it ?
- I do have an idea...

803
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,316
Looking for me ?

804
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,717
''Great spirits always meet.''
Who said that ?

805
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:22,876
I don't remember.

806
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:26,038
- Let's talk about the murders.
- There's no motive.

807
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:29,789
The motive is important
in investigations.

808
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,833
That comes later.

809
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:36,955
Hoffmann faked his death
to keep up his smuggling.

810
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,833
I didn't know that !

811
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,996
Stop acting so dumb.

812
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,397
A diamond smuggler
wouldn't waste time

813
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:49,309
in killing the witnesses
to Rosa Catena's death.

814
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,511
I see no motive.

815
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,955
Do you think Hoffmann is innocent ?

816
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:59,517
- What if it's blackmail ?
- A club of blackmailers ?

817
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,917
Blackmailers Associated ?
That's ridiculous.

818
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,157
- How's your blood pressure ?
- 1 80 !

819
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:10,674
- Sweets and alcohol sure help.
- I know.

820
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,388
So what is your conclusion ?

821
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:17,959
I ignored the motive.

822
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:21,709
I started with
little clues, little facts.

823
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,434
Like what ?

824
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,991
I studied the illustrations.

825
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,915
Little pictures for kids.

826
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:34,635
One for every victim,
by Hoffmann the writer.

827
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:38,393
Criminals always want
to get caught.

828
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:42,878
It is a macabre invitation
to a treasure hunt.

829
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:47,599
A plot by Hoffmann
to challenge the police.

830
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:53,349
- Shall we have a look ?
- I'd love to.

831
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:58,116
Here are the characters
in ''Shock-Headed Peter''.

832
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,838
Paolina was burned alive,
then there's Scissorman,

833
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:04,076
the three who drowned in ink.

834
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:08,877
- Do you like these ?
- I've always liked dark humour.

835
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,514
I like them.

836
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,631
All the characters are here.

837
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:17,753
Except for the main one,
the most well-known.

838
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:20,155
What's your name ?

839
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:23,876
- Peter Struwwel.
- The original German title.

840
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:29,195
- ''Struwwelpeter''.
- This is great !

841
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:32,119
So I'm the main character,

842
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:35,517
the last victim of the series ?

843
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:38,792
Or the killer, you choose.

844
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:43,236
That's very original,
I hadn't thought of that.

845
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:47,797
Me, an old limping man,
going around killing people.

846
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:53,830
It's too complex,
it would be too big of a mistake.

847
01:19:56,720 --> 01:20:00,076
You don't need to run to kill.
Or even leave your office.

848
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:06,353
- Then how did I do it ?
- By phone.

849
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:15,391
- What ?
- By phone.

850
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:21,397
You said before
it's all you need to rule a city.

851
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,910
Especially if
you know all its secrets.

852
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:32,071
And you have them:
files, records, pictures.

853
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:40,432
That's very sharp,
I underestimated you.

854
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:44,871
My frontal lobes
are highly developed.

855
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:50,395
So, Shock-Headed Peter...
I mean Peter Struwwel...

856
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:54,200
Shall we end this fable ?

857
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:07,598
Francesco Gragnati,
alcoholic thief.

858
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:13,152
He killed Falconieri.
He was a bus driver.

859
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:19,509
Pasquale Di Cesare,
TV cameraman,

860
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:23,713
sex maniac, exhibitionist,
three-time offender.

861
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:27,670
He killed Picozzi
during the TV show.

862
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:33,470
Gervaso Fabbri, taxi driver.

863
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:36,831
Suspected of killing
two members of high-society.

864
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:39,508
He killed Scanavini.

865
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:44,919
Luciano Gasparri,
heroin addict and dealer.

866
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,111
5-time offender.

867
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:49,276
He killed Colaianni.

868
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,756
And finally,
Fiorenzo Mascherpa.

869
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:59,478
He killed La Meniconi.

870
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,672
To make sure
she didn't reveal the name

871
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,111
of the person
who killed Mattia Grandi.

872
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,680
Satisfied ?

873
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,472
And we were only looking for
one killer !

874
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,516
Right.

875
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:27,430
Then you thought
there might be more than one.

876
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:33,673
Criminals don't usually make me
nauseous but you make me puke !

877
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:40,439
- You realized...
- A very simple thing.

878
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:44,110
How easy it is to be a killer.

879
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:48,757
Just have someone to order it
and money to pay for it.

880
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,758
Killing is child's play.

881
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:56,957
There's a thin line between
being honest and a killer.

882
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:01,516
We're all corruptible,
all of us can kill.

883
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:06,159
You knew all about
the people you paid !

884
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,112
Exactly !

885
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:13,632
Compromising pictures,
letters, recordings...

886
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,152
I'd grab the phone and say:

887
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,068
Go kill so-and-so.

888
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:22,999
And to save themselves,
they'd do it.

889
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,391
Blackmail and murder.

890
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:31,273
A refined technique,
easy to put into play.

891
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,193
Will I be able to leave ?
Preferably alive ?

892
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:45,710
Of course.

893
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,350
And take you to the station ?

894
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:54,519
If that's necessary,
but there's something else.

895
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:02,428
It would be sad
to have to leave all this.

896
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:06,519
Prison will be
a new experience.

897
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:09,996
But no one
will send me gifts.

898
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:13,158
I'll send you oranges and cigarettes.

899
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:16,352
And some chocolates too.

900
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:22,115
So I'm Shock-Headed Peter ?

901
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:25,312
And I challenged the police !

902
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,990
- You admitted it.
- You're right.

903
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:32,710
A macabre treasure hunt,
is what I said.

904
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:37,118
- I said something else too.
- What ?

905
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,310
The motive, remember ?

906
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,670
What's my motive ?

907
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:48,032
Why would I have killed
the Fauna Lovers ?

908
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:52,679
My clients were all
very rich people.

909
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:56,111
Just like the ones
who were killed.

910
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:59,676
Why would I kill my clients ?

911
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,474
My sources, my contacts !

912
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:06,639
No, businessmen
don't make moves like that.

913
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:10,598
Why did you show me
those slides ?

914
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:14,918
- To collaborate with the police.
- Against yourself ?

915
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:18,112
No, but you've figured that out.

916
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,912
Either you or
one of your men is the killer.

917
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:27,877
You could say,
one of my men.

918
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,038
You could also say,
one of yours.

919
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:36,030
When did you find out
Del Re was using your systems ?

920
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,231
2 or 3 days ago,
but it was too late.

921
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:45,230
I had to cover up the scandal
I would have been dragged into.

922
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,112
That was my only crime.

923
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,192
Is that all ?

924
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:54,680
Don't forget
I regularly collaborated with the law.

925
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,713
So, where is he ?

926
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:08,229
Here is the man
who put my theory into practice.

927
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:12,353
Anyone can kill if necessary.

928
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,630
A man with a motive.

929
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:17,832
His career was ruined
so he left the police.

930
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:23,189
He got revenge against
the people who ruined him through me.

931
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:27,075
Meet Inspector Del Re.

932
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,355
I'm pleased to meet you.

933
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,869
But you are under arrest.

934
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:44,119
No, I didn't do anything.

935
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:47,278
Struwwel, you're crazy.

936
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,556
You have no evidence against me.

937
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:56,111
I have all the evidence
I need.

938
01:26:56,320 --> 01:27:00,438
I defended you,
I made them suspect Hoffmann.

939
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:04,599
But Lo Menzo
figured it all out.

940
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:10,395
You're the victim now,
the game is over.

941
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,030
My poor friend.

942
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:16,835
I can only feel sorry for you.

943
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:20,629
Be rational and follow me.

944
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:24,118
I understand your anger,
your mistrust in the law

945
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,396
But our law is better

946
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:31,032
than doing it yourself,
despite its imperfections.

947
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:35,389
Don't you think ?
Let's go.

948
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,397
Stop !

949
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:44,675
There's no law,
we are the law !

950
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:49,071
Italy must be saved !

951
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,791
We need order !

952
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:57,032
We will save Italy !

953
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:03,759
Pandolfi is trying to escape !
He's armed !

954
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:07,555
- Shoot on sight !
- No, don't shoot you idiot !

955
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,991
No ! No !

956
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,073
