00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,823
Olor a cheerleading camp in
the morning, I love it.

3
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:37,688
# 1 cheerleading camp

4
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,744
... Five, six, seven, eight.

5
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:52,646
One, two, three, four,

6
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:54,479
five, six, seven and eight.

7
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,616
One, two, three, four, five ...

8
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:25,178
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven and eight.

9
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:27,145
One, two, three, four ...

10
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,015
No! Felice is the position
in "V", you have to ...

11
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:37,186
Britt, Felice can show
how is it done?

12
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:44,898
Señoritas, this is not
a camp pillow fights

13
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,299
for sexually frustrated women.

14
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:51,430
Are here to work!
Are here to cheer!

15
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,541
- Vamos!
- We are here to win!

16
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:02,949
Sorry.

17
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,388
One, two, three ...

18
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,263
Hello.
Sorry, can you tell me ...?

19
00:03:16,298 --> 00:03:18,060
... Five, six, seven and eight.

20
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,064
- Can you tell me Where to ...?
- No. Wait.

21
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,507
In truth I like the
cheerleaders, right?

22
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,338
Please. Wait.

23
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:32,912
That's right.

24
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,448
My God,

25
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,749
she 's ...

26
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:39,413
It's a professional.

27
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,248
Well, Let me see.

28
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,193
Michael. Maintenance?

29
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,660
I too.

30
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,162
You show your hut.

31
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,274
But why this girl does
not tena ...?

32
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:03,408
It's a good question.

33
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,479
In the immortal words of Mr.
Justin Timberlake

34
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:08,677
"A disfuncin wardrobe."

35
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:10,840
- I could see his butt.
- Really?

36
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,717
-Ya
- Okay.

37
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,854
And that is what they expect
the judges to see.

38
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:16,288
- You see, Mikey ...
- Michael.

39
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:20,727
Giles those girls, young,
smooth, perfect, sexy,

40
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:22,561
Bright, vibrant colors.

41
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,995
Now I just say adjectives.

42
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,697
This is a cheerleading camp,

43
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,366
an encampment for women
to learn their skills,

44
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:32,639
the polish, and participate in the
end, in the national competitions,

45
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:35,809
a scenario for the world to see.

46
00:04:35,844 --> 00:04:37,309
But she was naked ...

47
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,335
Who judges these skills?

48
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,446
Judges?

49
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,716
Hot old judges who prefer
to masturbate

50
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:50,417
these cheerleaders in person
free Internet download.

51
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:53,559
Okay.

52
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:58,689
But why now naked est?
Here there are no judges.

53
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,305
- It is very good.
-Ya is Trey.

54
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,673
He is the head of the entire
maintenance department.

55
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,916
Seriously, this is the place
to spend the summer.

56
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:18,617
It is as central to women.

57
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:22,305
Only young and hot girls away
from their boyfriends,

58
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,959
sexy clothes, and all the
others guys are gay.

59
00:05:25,994 --> 00:05:27,827
What? All men are gay?

60
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:29,947
All except me.

61
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:31,997
- Y. ..
- What?

62
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:35,535
- My God, you're gay.
- What?

63
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,136
- You're a fag.
- What?

64
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,808
Marica, maricn, homosexual,
how you want me to say?

65
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:44,578
- A What do you mean?
- A as it is known among gays.

66
00:05:44,613 --> 00:05:47,279
I do not care, I tena curiosity
when she was 13.

67
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:50,550
I wanted to see how you see a penis, I saw some magazines.
All right.

68
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:52,786
I do not say OF ANY
way, I'm not gay.

69
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:53,753
Well!

70
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,382
My God! I am very sorry.

71
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,526
- All right.
- New User?

72
00:05:59,561 --> 00:06:01,357
You're a cheerleader, cute?

73
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:05,231
- No, I'm keeping.
- So you're good with the stick.

74
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,664
- My God.
- Hey, big guy.

75
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,596
- Hi, Shawn.
- My God!

76
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,336
My God! S quin are.

77
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,642
- I do not know.
- I love youYa

78
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:21,047
They met at a bar?
In a sanitary installations
in a hotel room?

79
00:06:21,082 --> 00:06:22,207
On Youtube.

80
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,550
I have to go.

81
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:25,784
You're freezing!

82
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,769
- Freeze!
- Frozen?

83
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:30,920
Language is gay.
What does it mean?

84
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,426
In the last two years
weighed heavily,

85
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:37,364
but now I follow a diet
and lose some weight.

86
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:40,600
- I think this one be my year.
- Good for you.

87
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:41,567
Thanks.

88
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:47,200
Be careful what you touch, sometimes
there are more sticky.

89
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,732
Well, This is our room.

90
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,372
his is our litter.

91
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,142
You can have plug.

92
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,614
I sleep upstairs.

93
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,889
Thank God.

94
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,791
My diet aid arrived.

95
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,707
I have been waiting all week.

96
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:12,589
Seriously?
It is special meal or
something like that?

97
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,061
S. Something as.

98
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,303
I think your lamp fell.

99
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,478
- What is it?
- Not a lamp of truth,

100
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:27,112
is a "vaginalmpara."

101
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:30,207
It is very helpful with my
diet of masturbation.

102
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,251
It's the best.

103
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,154
This is the first diet I've
been able to maintain.

104
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:40,960
And I've tried everything.
Try the Atkins and
Zone, but sta ...

105
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:43,428
They say that one diet
does not work

106
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,227
unless you stick to it
throughout your life.

107
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,367
And with this diet,
I think I can.

108
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:52,496
You're kidding, right?
Diet of masturbation?

109
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,606
That can not exist.

110
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,709
Dselo Dr.
Sakamura, he invented it.

111
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:01,347
It is a success in Japan, but
still no hits in the U.S.

112
00:08:01,382 --> 00:08:03,645
But har. And I'm the first.

113
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,156
See?
Every time you ejaculate, you
burn a hundred calories,

114
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:13,260
as you should keep the
number of ejaculations

115
00:08:13,295 --> 00:08:16,329
above the number of calories
you consume.

116
00:08:16,364 --> 00:08:18,364
Then I can eat whatever I want.

117
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,662
I've lost about 2 kilos.

118
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,068
Well, noYa maybe one.

119
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,639
I think maybe it s not my bed.

120
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:27,605
What?

121
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,632
I'll get another.

122
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:34,647
- It does not matter.
- You can stay.

123
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:37,750
Read some magazines. Undress.

124
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:48,683
Ests right?

125
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,593
Sorry.

126
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,834
- My God, ESTs right?
- Me? No, t.

127
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:56,859
I crashed into you.

128
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,729
No, no, not really.

129
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,305
- Hot Ests.
- What?

130
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,175
Ests sweating.

131
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:08,775
I mean, ah must be very
hot in your thing.

132
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:13,186
Is, heat in that costume

133
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:16,087
in that costume.

134
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,424
Well. Let me get you some water.

135
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:22,292
- No, I'm fine. Seriously.
- You are very good.

136
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,693
- To fall?
- No.

137
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:28,334
For the jumps ago.
I saw a while ago.

138
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:30,234
- Are you a cheerleader?
- No.

139
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,164
You make me ... known.

140
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:39,608
Well, first practiced
gymnastics.

141
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,744
I gave you permission
to take off the mask?

142
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,352
Come, come!

143
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,556
You owe me a jump to ATRS ...

144
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:51,456
- Michael.
-Ya

145
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,729
his is an exciting year
for cheerleading camp.

146
00:09:56,764 --> 00:10:01,051
Not only our program passing
finally on TV

147
00:10:01,086 --> 00:10:05,314
and not just the winners
ganarn half-scholarships

148
00:10:05,349 --> 00:10:09,542
we also have in the camp
to the first judge

149
00:10:09,577 --> 00:10:12,978
which is a celebrity:
Charlene Tilton.

150
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:19,852
For many years, Charlene and
I share a common path.

151
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:21,986
Both went to the same secondary

152
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,191
Charlene notif although
some years before me,

153
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:27,386
his legacy continues.

154
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:32,026
No matter what I did, I never compare
myself with her pruning.

155
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:36,499
No one was compared with the
queen Charlene Tilton.

156
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,071
Although I did not have the
same advantages it had.

157
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:43,676
Dad's bank account, the operation
of breasts, nose,

158
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:46,201
stores ... What was I saying?

159
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:51,946
Charlene form the group of
cheerleaders at school

160
00:10:51,981 --> 00:10:56,445
and due to its high persistence,
and his thirst for success,

161
00:10:56,856 --> 00:11:01,976
so to speak, this led to
the glamor of Hollywood

162
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:07,096
and played a leading role in "Dallas",
and I ended up here.

163
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,969
Being in my hut with a drink.

164
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:12,836
Ms. Charlene Tilton!

165
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,578
- I was upset.
- I throw it down.

166
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:26,886
Charlene is obviously a big celebrity
and needs to rest.

167
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:29,821
Always have to wear
costumes for pets?

168
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,790
It's like the pet law.

169
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,095
And how to eat with the mask on?

170
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:41,032
S not, but that girl
flirting est you.

171
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,500
How can you tell?

172
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:46,465
It can be seen. Just look.

173
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,072
See that?

174
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:50,809
Just ah.

175
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,047
- What?
- Not a direct flirting.

176
00:11:54,082 --> 00:11:56,743
Watch the body language.

177
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,653
My God.
You should go talk to her.

178
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:02,420
- Really?
- I'm serious.

179
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,657
- My God, I est smiling.
- Really?

180
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:06,859
You have to go.
T If you do not,
it will make me.

181
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,912
- Basta. Go
- I go.

182
00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:11,622
- Go
- Then go.

183
00:12:11,657 --> 00:12:14,297
- Lo har. Basta.
- Come on.

184
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,106
Hello.

185
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,098
What to see you.

186
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,141
Remember me?

187
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,415
I hope you feel better now.

188
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:34,620
And that you've cooled
it had every heat.

189
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:36,952
A while ago, because
they are running.

190
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,356
Thanks.

191
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,825
Good to see you here.

192
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,354
Obviously we can not be somewhere else because we are here y.
..

193
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,245
So ...

194
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,877
why we are here

195
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:08,181
You can take off the mask now?

196
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,316
No. I do not want.

197
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,118
It is very ...

198
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,329
S.

199
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,070
Okay.

200
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,375
Sure.

201
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,174
They're great.

202
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,383
So soft.

203
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:40,719
Michael?

204
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,920
Oh, no! Wait, wait!

205
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,788
- Wait.
- Hey, handsome.

206
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,629
What the hell ...?

207
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,988
Cre you were a girl.

208
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,535
- No saba!
- How dare you?

209
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,405
Divirtindote here with this fag?

210
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,705
- I'm not gay!
- Claro.

211
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,807
Maybe you want to
impress this guy,

212
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,345
but do not let him disrespect
to the image of the squirrel.

213
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,142
Qutatela now!

214
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,376
Est naked.

215
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,583
Qudatelo post!

216
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:17,688
I swear.

217
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:21,460
I did not know that was a man.
Cre that ...

218
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:22,984
I'm not gay!

219
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:28,234
All right.
Do not avergences, here
we accept gays.

220
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:30,102
Wait, wait a minute!

221
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:31,899
Detnganse!

222
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,138
I've been there.

223
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,817
Well ...

224
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:48,009
This will cost about
eight sessions.

225
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,389
Hi, how did it go?

226
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:57,257
He was a man.
She was not.
It was a squirrel and a man.

227
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,797
Sure.

228
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,732
I wondered why.

229
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,192
Those breasts do not
look very ...

230
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,137
- Female.
- The Sabas?

231
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:09,942
And do not tell me before to
get my hands on your butt?

232
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:12,410
Beaver, squirrel, is the same.

233
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,881
And beans I left
when I realized.

234
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,815
Wait, you played?

235
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,652
You move? Not a bit?

236
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:20,618
Basta.

237
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:24,657
I imagine in the real world
are not a magnet for girls.

238
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:26,724
What? Look, be well

239
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,029
if you had done all
think I'm gay.

240
00:15:30,064 --> 00:15:32,430
Yourself, you take care
of promoting yourself.

241
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:35,701
You know what?
Do not think you can
get two pretty girls

242
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:37,902
and sleep with them
at the same time.

243
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,574
- What? How we get there?
- That's my goal for the summer.

244
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:43,641
Two chicks at the same time.

245
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:47,112
It's a 369.
Indeed burning calories.

246
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,881
You're kidding, right?

247
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,147
Are you serious?

248
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:53,485
You did not have children?
It is the fantasy of every boy.

249
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,789
It's like the difference between
doing it with a sock,

250
00:15:56,824 --> 00:15:59,189
This y. .. s fine

251
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:04,797
pick a watermelon, which
is incredible.

252
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:06,898
Wait. Pick a watermelon?

253
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,669
You never got your dick
in a watermelon?

254
00:16:09,704 --> 00:16:12,331
Let me think. No.

255
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,990
It's the best.
I only do it all the time

256
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:17,141
before the arrival
of my diet aid.

257
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:21,510
The HACA in the same kitchen.
In fact ah is a, and ma.

258
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,117
Dude, anyone can eat that.

259
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,155
You know?
Germs The penis is less
than the hands.

260
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,821
There is not any danger.

261
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,924
Very well, sire, let's bet.

262
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,463
Whoever gets the first bed with
two women at the same time

263
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:38,725
wins.

264
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:42,166
I never said I was a stallion.

265
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,404
And I am content with. Agree?

266
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:48,965
- I want more.
-Ya Why not?

267
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,267
Anyway, a s fine.

268
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,947
Hi, guys.
They talked about a bet?

269
00:16:54,982 --> 00:16:56,247
No bet.

270
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:59,151
S, is a bet.
Who can get Hablbamos on

271
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,384
first make a TRO.

272
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,286
Just to clarify, with two girls.

273
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:05,222
I want to participate.
Cul is the prize?

274
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,827
In addition to having
sex with two girls?

275
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:10,261
Glory, glory!

276
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:13,099
To m 's fine.
Come on, guys, let's clean.

277
00:17:13,134 --> 00:17:15,465
- Come on.
- Okay. Mr Sanda.

278
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:26,979
No!

279
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,146
Wait, do not eat that!

280
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,779
Why? What happens?

281
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,318
It is my butt, right?
Is very large.

282
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,523
Holly always says I can not
eat anything with sugar.

283
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,776
No, no, not your back.

284
00:17:39,811 --> 00:17:41,983
Your ass is perfect.

285
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:44,155
- I mean ...
- Really?

286
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,789
Sure you say that to all pets.

287
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,936
It was not my intention.

288
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:52,903
No. Listen.

289
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:56,242
About that, s what
it seems, but ...

290
00:17:56,277 --> 00:17:59,302
Again, I need to take
out the trash.

291
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,885
- Trey is so cute, right?
- What?

292
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,755
Listen to Beaver!

293
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:53,859
This year is much improved.

294
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,302
May actually win.

295
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,829
Winning second place.

296
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,868
Well, this is the s basic method
to change a light bulb.

297
00:19:28,903 --> 00:19:30,401
It really is a science.

298
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:33,604
You step on the beams
and change the focus.

299
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:36,307
When you're ah, you stay
as long as possible

300
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:40,079
for girls to forget you, and
then is like a porno.

301
00:19:40,114 --> 00:19:42,581
- They start touching each other.
- Claro.

302
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:44,181
I'm serious, it's great.

303
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:48,187
It is very useful for those Deposit
Policy in the sperm bank.

304
00:19:48,222 --> 00:19:51,856
And there s t, but my account
is a little low.

305
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:55,594
With 10 retreats to give,
if you know what I mean.

306
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:57,061
Masturbation.

307
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,497
Sure.

308
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,262
Should not touch first?

309
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,367
Ray!

310
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:04,533
Est empty.

311
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,641
- Come on.
- Okay.

312
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,883
- Thanks.
- Okay.

313
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,647
This is where the magic happens.

314
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:27,148
Here 's the new.

315
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,920
Okay, Let 's go.

316
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,998
My God.

317
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,602
- Come to Baars.
- What?

318
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,546
- Will Baars!
- Let 's go!

319
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,348
- I think I hurt.
- Be better not.

320
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:55,218
You should go with Ms.
Simmons and ask her ...

321
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:59,054
- Vibrator.
- I do not want your vibrator.
What sucks.

322
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,528
No, not a vibrator, is a ...
heater

323
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:05,529
is one thing for thighs.

324
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:09,468
You mean the device
for strong muscles?

325
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,629
S, that is.

326
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:14,738
Girl, learn the language.

327
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,907
AFTER you talk to them
from the practice?

328
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,879
S, everything is fine.
We reached a settlement
with the school.

329
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:23,006
- All right.
- Cool.

330
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,917
I get papers for registration.

331
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,548
My God.

332
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,209
Girl, I can talk to you?

333
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:07,426
I worry that estn up
a little weight.

334
00:22:07,461 --> 00:22:10,580
No, Britt, I swear.
I'm just a little swollen.

335
00:22:10,615 --> 00:22:14,009
S, I also are premenstrual
symptoms.

336
00:22:14,044 --> 00:22:17,403
Well, looks like your
breasts large estnms.

337
00:22:17,438 --> 00:22:18,665
Djenme see.

338
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,765
S, estnms large.

339
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,439
Are enormous.

340
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,575
Size D should be now.

341
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,781
What are making?

342
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,808
We're comparing breast sizes.

343
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:37,679
Mosquitoes are larger
than yours.

344
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:40,851
Sure, Felice, much bigger.

345
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,019
S how I have to know
who the great ms.

346
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:49,833
- Look at what he does.
- I'm not a lesbian!

347
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,069
- She does not understand.
- Le est touching her breasts.

348
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:55,369
Maybe your breasts are larger,
but let's see your ass.

349
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:06,676
No!

350
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:09,553
Damn!

351
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,989
What are you doing
here, you pervert?

352
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:14,626
U.S. damn perverts!

353
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:15,593
Long!

354
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:18,519
Get out of here, sick!

355
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,299
Seriously.

356
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:24,268
That was great.

357
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:27,039
Deb have burned about 400
calories with that.

358
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:28,672
I love those girls.

359
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:31,369
I'm going to the hut
for round two.

360
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,221
I did not order this.

361
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,957
Curse.

362
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,126
My parents sent him.

363
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,260
It is a pommel horse.

364
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,755
Your parents want you to be gay?

365
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,717
No, it's gymnastics.

366
00:23:56,752 --> 00:23:59,136
They believe that ...

367
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:01,305
No matter.

368
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,439
What we have here?

369
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:07,275
There is space for something ah.
May put a couple of vibrators.

370
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,546
Something that vibrates, you know,
for when you mountains.

371
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,244
You cross a little.

372
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,918
That will be very good.

373
00:24:16,953 --> 00:24:18,916
I bet you liked it.

374
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:22,594
Maybe put another vibrator here.

375
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:24,291
And another ac ago.

376
00:24:24,326 --> 00:24:25,953
It will be very good.

377
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,900
You sweat a lot on this thing?
I bet youYa

378
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:34,206
I slipped.
NoYa after a few
turns, you slip.

379
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:36,708
Thing will be mounted as.

380
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:40,542
And do not let go.

381
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:45,978
Time to wake up! Get out of bed!

382
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,909
It's time to cheer!

383
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:15,836
The trick is to turn it as.

384
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:23,418
Turn off the sprinklers!

385
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,122
All you is a beer commercial?

386
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:33,298
S.

387
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,367
Vamos!

388
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:43,665
Will lift. Here it comes.

389
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,392
Turn off the sprinklers!

390
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:11,069
Sorry!

391
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,708
- Is the new kid.
- No, no.

392
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:21,346
A big applause for squirrels!

393
00:26:21,381 --> 00:26:23,013
Thanks, squirrels.

394
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:26,618
And for below the beavers!

395
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:28,711
Come on, beavers!

396
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,421
Where is it Natalie?

397
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:38,662
Ms. Simmons, you can not start.

398
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:41,723
Ms. Simmons, our captain
is not here.

399
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:46,568
Start anyway!

400
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,754
Stop, stop! Stop the music.

401
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:08,553
Natalia, you have to be here.

402
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,827
Sorry, Miss Simmons.

403
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:13,888
I forgot to tell you
who joined my team.

404
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:18,670
- Señoritas!
- Aleja your costume beaver m.

405
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:21,230
High or suspend them both.
What happens?

406
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:26,745
Natalie and the kids want to be on
the winning team, that's all.

407
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,348
No rule prevents you
to join our team.

408
00:27:29,383 --> 00:27:31,715
But they can not do that, right?

409
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,120
- Well, will check ...
- If estn in this camp

410
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:36,787
can join the team they want.

411
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:40,781
The attorney for my dad and magazines.
Validate perfectly.

412
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:44,187
But, what shall we do?

413
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,865
If they can gather more
members in your group,

414
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,499
sorry but podrn not compete.

415
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:52,731
Can stay to improve their
skills, but ...

416
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,441
But then we will not be eligible
for scholarships.

417
00:27:57,643 --> 00:28:00,840
The poor little beaver
to go to college?

418
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:07,479
Friend, is very bad for them.

419
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:11,419
These girls are very
vulnerable now.

420
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,088
I bet you can convince
us to have a TRO.

421
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,594
I do not want to have sex
with him and a girl.

422
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:21,733
Want to stop being such a sissy?
I do not want to have
sex with you.

423
00:28:21,768 --> 00:28:23,600
I want to have sex with them.

424
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:27,469
T may be ah, just as support.

425
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:29,674
Wait.

426
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:31,109
Hey.

427
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:34,546
Hey, you never told me
your name before.

428
00:28:34,581 --> 00:28:36,605
Never mind, I'm going.

429
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:39,811
My name is Sophie.

430
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:41,619
Sophie.

431
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:45,457
Ms. Simmons just wants
more cheerleaders

432
00:28:45,492 --> 00:28:47,059
- Why not get them?
- I can not.

433
00:28:47,094 --> 00:28:48,625
I can not do what they do.

434
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,830
You can do a double jump with
a beaver costume post.

435
00:28:51,865 --> 00:28:53,422
It does not weigh much.

436
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:57,093
In addition, no good
cheerleader.

437
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,996
It would have been
great, but ...

438
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,009
I'm better off inside than outside l.
costume

439
00:29:04,044 --> 00:29:05,772
If you know what I mean.

440
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,411
Not really.

441
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,846
Want this scholarship?

442
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:12,082
Olvdalo.
Half of the girls irn today

443
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:15,644
- And the rest in the morning.
- You want that 
cholarship or not?

444
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,614
Mike, come on, we need
to fix the window.

445
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,724
Also brings that crap.

446
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:35,139
Friend ...

447
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,309
olvdalo alone, okay?

448
00:29:37,344 --> 00:29:38,575
A girl,

449
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,781
a girl who never let
you sleep with her

450
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:44,681
while another girl.

451
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,917
That is the situation.

452
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,385
But his is the best part.

453
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:52,120
There are millions of girls here
that s will do that for you.

454
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:54,718
If she had her own group,

455
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:59,097
you will notice how good it is.

456
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:00,063
S, of course.

457
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,199
What we must do now
is find a place

458
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:07,105
full of athletic girls that look
good with very little clothing,

459
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,563
and who want to dance in front
of a bunch of people.

460
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:14,375
If there is a place as, ah
will be all the time.

461
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,347
Wait.

462
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,515
NUDE GIRLS

463
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,075
PARACABALLEROS PLATINUM CLUB

464
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:26,918
- Don 's, do not think this ...
- Tranquilzate be great.

465
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,463
This is incredible.

466
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,991
If a guy wants to pay
you to go private

467
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:11,586
you should go with him, right?

468
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:13,637
is not the problem, Marco,

469
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:17,342
the problem is they want
to do when they're ah.

470
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:18,775
it is the problem.

471
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:22,312
If you do not want customer
satisfaction, is fine,

472
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:26,113
but you deduct the money
that you already byYa

473
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:29,452
And I say to all who work here!

474
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,357
If you want to keep your job.
Now do me a favor.

475
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:33,824
SBET the stage!

476
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,363
Must pay 10 dollars.

477
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,404
- Largo.
- Wait, we are old.

478
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:47,706
We already have 18.

479
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:48,939
See that sign?

480
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:50,507
FOR OVER 21 YEARS

481
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:53,011
- PROMOTION Tuesday?
- No, the other sign.

482
00:31:53,046 --> 00:31:54,344
Must be 21.

483
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:57,871
What do you think if you
look the other way?

484
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:00,483
Okay.

485
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:04,454
We go, we go.

486
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:14,394
We were so close, it was
like the promised land.

487
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:22,741
What? No, I do not.
That guy was serious.

488
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:25,210
Not a good idea. Qu ESTs doing?

Okay.

- The private?
- No, silly, is the clubhouse.

493
00:32:56,676 --> 00:32:57,903
Sorry

494
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,379
I think that should not be here.

495
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:04,981
My God. Is P412657.

496
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:07,953
This still does not
come on the market.

497
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:08,920
What?

498
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,412
No, you're right.

499
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,586
Wanted a dance before.

500
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:20,832
I have a child, but if you
want to do other things,

501
00:33:20,867 --> 00:33:22,527
I go from here.

502
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:28,840
This is for you.

503
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:29,966
Thanks.

504
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:40,285
You'll use the red covered today?
I want to use me.

505
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,054
Sure.
I'll try this. Want to see?

506
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:44,021
S.

507
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:46,122
- Look.
- It's very nice.

508
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:48,182
- I just got.
- Really?

509
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,331
Hi, girls, have problems
with the lamp?

510
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:55,196
S. Decomposed.

511
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,734
- Now works.
- Thanks, Tom.

512
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,837
- Help me?
-Ya

513
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,791
Start the spectacle,
brings to the girls.

514
00:34:19,826 --> 00:34:20,924
S, of course.

515
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:23,325
Girls, your turn. To make money.

516
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:25,119
Come on.

517
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,177
Sentmonos.

518
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:08,640
- Want to dance?
-Ya of course!

519
00:35:08,675 --> 00:35:11,641
You know? We just want to talk.

520
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:14,406
Very funny, we can not
talk without dance.

521
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,856
The real reason we came here for

522
00:35:24,891 --> 00:35:28,223
was because the estbamos seeing y.
..

523
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,857
noticed they are very athletic.

524
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:34,497
Thanks.

525
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:37,669
Many people think it's a game,
but it takes talent

526
00:35:37,704 --> 00:35:39,830
- To do what we do.
- Right.

527
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,838
True, true.

528
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:45,570
Speaking of which, we
preguntbamos if ...

529
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:50,538
you two be interested
in cheerleading.

530
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,578
Cheerleaders?

531
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:57,087
Hey, Bliss, this guy wants
us to be cheerleaders.

532
00:35:57,122 --> 00:36:00,825
Look, do not go to private
to have sex with you ...

533
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:04,112
No, not that.
Cheerleader of truth.

534
00:36:04,147 --> 00:36:07,330
It's a cheerleading competition.

535
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:10,630
And there will be college scholarships
for the winners.

536
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:14,439
- The university?
- The university is great.

537
00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:16,464
That will serve much here.

538
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:19,110
Ray!

539
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:25,950
Hey!

540
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,484
- Hear, hear.
- Michael.

541
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:31,723
Michael.
You mentioned something
about a scholarship?

542
00:36:31,758 --> 00:36:32,690
S.

543
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:37,559
It's a ... half scholarship.

544
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:49,474
I can not believe that
we have been stripped.

545
00:36:49,509 --> 00:36:53,042
S behaved like a creep.

546
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:56,103
I never want to know about
the promotion on Tuesday.

547
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:58,415
You know?

548
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:02,512
I will not go as it is shameful.

549
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:07,050
I get to the pool
and take a towel.

550
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:10,120
I go to the kitchen
for a watermelon.

551
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:11,928
Swim with caution.

552
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:14,765
Well.

553
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,433
Hey, here!

554
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:22,873

555
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:25,372
- In here.

556
00:37:25,407 --> 00:37:27,436
- In here.

557
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,909
- Silence.

558
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:38,323
Sure, and you were naked in El Paseo de los gays.

559
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:40,425

- Agchate.

560
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,392

Here?

565
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:52,302
Now?

566
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:54,405
Sure, it's the perfect
time of night.

567
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,202
Want to accompany?

568
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:58,108
Well ...

570
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:08,853

00:38:08,888 --> 00:38:10,514

Basta!

574
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,296
I'm getting nervous?

575
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,638
No, no, not really.

576
00:38:26,673 --> 00:38:28,128
Okay.

577
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:34,944
Enough, enough!

578
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,413
Michael, what happens?

579
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:40,843
I will tell you what

580
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:44,222
- No, I'm not.
-Ya s as ESTs.

581
00:38:44,257 --> 00:38:45,485
It is not what it seems.

582
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,713
See this? Mira.

583
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:50,695
- And I'm not with you?
- Sorry.

584
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,895
I'm going tomorrow ...

585
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:57,424
- You two make nice couple.
- No, do not make a nice couple.

586
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:00,036
Wait, do not go!

587
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,936
What is your fucking problem?

588
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,907
Damn!

589
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,589
Miss Tilton?

590
00:39:18,624 --> 00:39:19,556
S.

591
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:23,352
It's great to do this.
I admire her.

592
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,329
How old are you? 12?

593
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,167
- Who do not even know me.
- Is wrong.

594
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:31,795
You are an inspiration
to these girls.

595
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,537
Seriously?

596
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:38,509
Probably you've seen in
reruns of "Happy Days"

597
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:40,009
"Married with Children",

598
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,046
or maybe in my role
in "Nio problem 2."

599
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:47,318
They are classics.
And most importantly, is
a leader cheerleading

600
00:39:47,353 --> 00:39:49,115
made something of her life.

601
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:50,745
Thanks.

602
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,660
I regret what happened with
your team yesterday.

603
00:39:55,695 --> 00:39:58,288
Britt is a miserable, right?

604
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:03,329
But listen, You'll have
to get more rough.

605
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:07,565
That sort of thing the encontrars
you forever.

606
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:10,474
So ...

607
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,467
going to give up?

608
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,501
- I have another option?
- No.

609
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,813
You must surrender.

610
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:22,209
Hey, Britt is king here.

611
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:25,956
- Thanks.
- Claro.

612
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,821

615
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:51,749
Michael?

616
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:54,980
Will not you say goodbye?

617
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,255
Look ...

618
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,147
About last night ...

619
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,028
No, not that.

620
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,663
No, I ...

621
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:13,571

622
00:41:13,606 --> 00:41:15,004
No!

623
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:17,908
You know what?

624

I give up.

625
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:22,570
Have a good summer.

626
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:26,079
Truly you are great.

627
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:28,218
Thanks.

628
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:31,513
And sorry again about
last night.

629
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:33,814
I'm so ashamed.

630
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:43,668

631

They want out very well
on television.

646
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,681
Y t can be trained to do so.

647
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,277
But do not go to school.

648
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:45,161
In fact, think about it.

649

00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,613
I'm just a pet.

656
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,719
See the new Beavers.

657
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:15,259
Someone should tell them it's
a cheerleading competition,

658
00:43:15,294 --> 00:43:17,022
not a show of phenomena.

659
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:22,066
What sad.
They think they can win with
all these phenomena

660
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:23,465
and prostitutes.

661
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:29,134
Look, the pet est
on the computer.

662
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,232
I'm not the pet!

663
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,374
I am a cheerleader.

664
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:36,280
Seriously?

665
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:38,314
We'll see.

666
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,317
S, we are in competition.

667
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:49,994
Heard what I said?
It was as if in a trance.

668
00:43:50,029 --> 00:43:51,086
It was like ...

669
00:43:53,698 --> 00:43:55,416
You're a cheerleader!

670
00:43:55,451 --> 00:43:57,134
We're all cheerleaders.

671
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:58,968
Come on, beavers!

672
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:13,484
Hey, it's time to fight.
All scream green and white.

673
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:15,952
Hey, it's time to fight ...

674
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:19,555
Cinnamon, you can throw the gum?

675
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:23,219
No, I need to keep pace.

676
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:31,463
Hey, it's time to fight.
All scream green and white.

677
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,769
I hope they can succeed.

678
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:37,758
S, they seem to take
the whole summer.

679
00:44:37,793 --> 00:44:42,067
Better, and you can take
off your heels?

680
00:44:42,102 --> 00:44:46,342
And your blouse, you
can subrtela a bit?

681
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:50,021
Much better.
Asegrense to make a "V" great.

682
00:44:50,056 --> 00:44:51,020
And use your mouth.

683
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:52,989
All scream green and white.

684
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:58,129
Hey, it's time to fight.
All scream green and white.

685
00:44:58,164 --> 00:44:59,118
What do they do?

686
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:01,131
sa is my "V".

687
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:02,431
Nice and tight.

688
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,457
Is your vagina, and I like it.

689
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:08,704
What are you doing
with your face?

690
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:11,173
You said usramos mouth, no?

691
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:18,272
NoYa

692
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:20,683
It is not working.

693
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,983
Ie, they have some skills

694
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:26,789
but I can not be perfected.

695
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:31,284
We have no discipline.
I can not pass.

696
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:33,756
T practiced gymnastics.

697
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:36,762
Why do not you join us?

698
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:39,166
We could use your muscles.

699
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:43,434
I can not. It's just that ...

700
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,568
Sorry.

701
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:49,480
What is doing?

702
00:45:49,515 --> 00:45:51,277
That's ...

703
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:53,947
some Eastern meditation.

704
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:55,741
See that?

705
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:59,945
I think that's what we
need for the team.

706
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:03,292
That? No, it's kickboxing.

707
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:05,996
It's very different to what
they do cheerleading.

708
00:46:06,031 --> 00:46:07,088
I think not.

709
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,465
I think based on the same ideas.

710
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,871
- I think ... I'll talk to l.
- Okay.

711
00:46:13,906 --> 00:46:15,099
See you after.

712
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:22,910
It was good exercise.

713
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:26,181
Deb burn 120 calories.

714
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:35,392
Hello.

715
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:40,631
Trey ask him to join the team.

716
00:46:40,666 --> 00:46:41,689
Rays.

717
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:43,860
Come on.

718
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:47,196
We have to clean the kitchen.

719
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:53,474
Maybe not reached an
agreement with l.

720
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:58,215
Maybe I just talk about
things cheerleading.

721
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,910
S, of course.

722
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:19,433
Tastes so rich.

723
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:22,432
Maybe I'm ready to give me.

724
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:24,340
Your part?

725
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:27,042
Our captain never
let us eat this.

726
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:31,309
Seriously?
If you want, I have the
keys to the kingdom ...

727
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:34,683
I can get you anything you want.

728
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:38,789
Felice, come on, we gotta go.
Practices we have today.
Come on.

729
00:47:38,824 --> 00:47:42,660
Wait, maybe we can
meet afterwards.

730
00:47:42,695 --> 00:47:44,992
No, I have plans to Ronda.

731
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:49,299
Although pudira come to us ...

732
00:47:49,334 --> 00:47:53,135
if you give me that which
I love so much.

733
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:58,107
- What is it that you like so much?
- Chocolate with man.

734
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:00,203
Seriously?

735
00:48:00,578 --> 00:48:03,179
S, chocolates with man.

736
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:06,513
Just to clarify, you
want a penis?

737
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:10,186
A chocolate covered penis?

738
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:15,625
S, these chocolates
are great man.

739
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:19,363
Okay, I can consegurtelos.

740
00:48:19,398 --> 00:48:21,024
What could be better?

741
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:24,299
Nothing can be better than that.

742
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:28,836
Well, see you in the night.

743
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,044
Come on, you can come.

744
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,178
Being a hot night.

745
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:39,811
Of course not.

746
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:41,283
Not interested.

747
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:43,821
Quedars you here while
I have fun in bed?

748
00:48:43,856 --> 00:48:47,491
- No bed IRSA.
-Ya it will do, and I will win

749
00:48:47,526 --> 00:48:50,688
t because you are afraid to act.

750
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:58,568
Great.

751
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:18,054
Now, in the pommel horse,
Michael Coker.

752
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:26,453
What is doing?

753
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:32,592
Seems like a frightened deer.

754
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,907
Do not worry, son,
could you be well.

755
00:49:36,942 --> 00:49:38,742
Just remember to get up to 9.

756
00:49:38,777 --> 00:49:40,442
Remember to be above 9.

757
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,776
Remember, do not accept anyone
who does not get above 9.

758
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:51,922
I do not accept anyone who
does not get above 9.

759
00:49:51,957 --> 00:49:55,292
- ... above 9.
- Do not accept anyone.

760
00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:57,528
Remember to be above 9.

761
00:49:57,563 --> 00:49:59,695
Never had seen anything
like this.

762
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:02,927
I do not accept anyone who
does not get above 9.

763
00:50:30,728 --> 00:50:33,390
Time for a little
chocolate penis.

764
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:44,265
It feels good.

765
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,838
Rays.

766
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:54,050
S, that is.Ya

767
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,124
Is this a joke?

768
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:05,195
I want to make fun of her
because she is black?

769
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,598
No, no, she said ... t said ...

770
00:51:07,633 --> 00:51:09,932
- You liked.
- Like it What?

771
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:12,834
Watching a fat guy
with a black face?

772
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:17,133
- Why I liked it?
- A chocolate-covered penis.

773
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:24,681
- I said a chocolate man.
- So a chocolate penis.

774
00:51:24,716 --> 00:51:30,551
No, I said "man." MAN.

775
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:33,557
- Man?
-Ya of course.

776
00:51:33,592 --> 00:51:36,286
Man

777
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:42,160
This is funny. I mean ...

778
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,027
I believe the TRO is dismissed.

779
00:51:47,738 --> 00:51:48,705
Let 's go.

780
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:52,173
No? Well, okay ..

781
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:54,909
Since I'm here.

782
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:11,024
Look at that.

783
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,890
It seems to be the leader
of the team.

784
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:17,027
It seems that all are his fans.

785
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,009
You know what?
There's a party tonight.

786
00:52:26,044 --> 00:52:28,596
You should talk to
her and explain.

787
00:52:28,631 --> 00:52:31,113
Too late for that. Not work.

788
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:34,885
Too late?
HACA is what Garfield
when wanted lasa?

789
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,955
Only the HACA, went after
her, and obtained.

790
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:40,322
Do not let anything
you traverse.

791
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:43,460
Eats all of the LASA.
And then to What?

792
00:52:43,495 --> 00:52:46,528
I was on ms Lasa, because
it is a great guy.

793
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:49,896
And that is what you should be t.
You must be very good at it.

794
00:52:58,442 --> 00:53:00,043
That was very bad.

795
00:53:00,078 --> 00:53:01,623
I'm not very strong.

796
00:53:01,658 --> 00:53:03,169
Probably perders.

797
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:06,642
- That does not give me mous!
- Demndame.

798
00:53:42,486 --> 00:53:43,453
Curse!

799
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:46,188
Beavers estn improving.

800
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:49,590
- Only Trey.
- And the girl stripper.

801
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:54,598
Is good.
How is that you have
time to practice?

802
00:53:54,633 --> 00:53:57,761
There has to be working?

803
00:53:58,135 --> 00:54:01,229
Da does not work.

804
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:05,102
S, s work.

805
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:07,274
Definitely.

806
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,213
Sorry.

807
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:13,983
- Where is it entertainment?
- Just ah.

808
00:54:14,018 --> 00:54:16,451
- Or you can go to the darkroom.
-YaYa

809
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:19,649
We need something more personal,
but not so personal.

810
00:54:20,057 --> 00:54:23,618
Sorry, will have to
return AFTER five.

811
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:26,960
I would like to speak with the
owner of this establishment.

812
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:29,197
Wait here.

813
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:36,472
What I can do for you?

814
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,165
Everything.

815
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:46,850
Look, we have dancers now, but you can come back a.
..

816
00:54:46,885 --> 00:54:48,617
No, not what we want.

817
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:50,987
I work for an ent
rtainment company.

818
00:54:51,022 --> 00:54:53,288
And many executives vendrn
the following week

819
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,726
for cheerleading competition.
Maybe you know something
about it.

820
00:54:55,761 --> 00:54:57,025
-Ya I'm aware.
- Okay.

821
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,830
These executives are
nothing gustarams

822
00:54:59,865 --> 00:55:03,098
to see strippers at noon.

823
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,936
But if you do not have spectacles
in the morning, we will ...

824
00:55:05,971 --> 00:55:07,872
No, no, wait.

825
00:55:07,907 --> 00:55:09,738
I have girls.

826
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:12,576
I have to rearrange.
The sooner I can take.

827
00:55:12,611 --> 00:55:15,443
- Sure you can.
- Come on, please.

828
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,112
They work for m.

829
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:20,584
I will have the girls here,
t brings executives want.

830
00:55:20,619 --> 00:55:22,484
The har.

831
00:55:28,025 --> 00:55:29,754
Where to hell est Felice?

832
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:41,804
Felice!

833
00:55:42,973 --> 00:55:43,940
Sorry.

834
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:46,508
It was only for research.

835
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:50,206
Trying to get into my character.

836
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:54,210
It's called Candy Cane.
It is erotic, no?

837
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:57,185
Come on, we have a party
to which to go.

838
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:01,817
Sure you do not want to come?
Be an incredible party.

839
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:07,091
Podrs explain to her.
Convince her that
you are not gay.

840
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,401
What is this?
You can warn for the upcoming.

841
00:56:12,436 --> 00:56:17,407
Beware this is new.
It is very expensive.
It is part of a set.

842
00:56:17,442 --> 00:56:21,812
That was a mouth, and
this is a vagina.

843
00:56:21,847 --> 00:56:24,975
And here ... This is one year.

844
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:29,277
You know what is best?
Who can talk.

845
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:32,455
CGEM drive.

846
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:36,724
CGEM by ATRS, stallion.

847
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,391
CGEM drive.

848
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:41,323
You can also program
it to read this.

849
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:45,128
Michael, I want to take it.

850
00:56:46,036 --> 00:56:51,007
I want to fuck me
in my hole round.

851
00:56:51,042 --> 00:56:53,669
Come on, big guy!

852
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:58,844
Michael, I want to take it.

853
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:04,721
I want to fuck me
in my hole round.

854
00:57:04,756 --> 00:57:06,957
Come on, big guy!

855
00:57:06,992 --> 00:57:08,049
Cool, huh?

856
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:12,062
You can use the one I
want when he is not.

857
00:57:12,097 --> 00:57:14,096
When you're at the party,

858
00:57:14,131 --> 00:57:16,832
or go for a few strippers
and win the bet.

859
00:57:16,867 --> 00:57:21,271
- There is no bet.
- Of course there's a bet.

860
00:57:21,306 --> 00:57:24,140
You can deny it all you
want, but remember,

861
00:57:24,175 --> 00:57:26,974
if you are afraid to compete,
then you missed out.

862
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:33,739
Afraid to compete.

863
00:57:34,518 --> 00:57:36,885
Remember to get up to 9.

864
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,946
I do not go with anyone
who take less than 9.

865
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:52,135
- I want to study forensic science.
- What is it?

866
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:53,762
It's like CSI.

867
00:57:54,371 --> 00:57:56,940
- New York or Miami?
- Las Vegas.

868
00:57:56,975 --> 00:57:59,033
Well. Qu original.

869
00:58:07,918 --> 00:58:09,317
According to the American
tradition,

870
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:12,289
The beaver is a force
to be considered

871
00:58:12,324 --> 00:58:14,324
business issues and struggles,

872
00:58:14,359 --> 00:58:15,985
things and not vaginas.

873
00:58:18,562 --> 00:58:20,530
- Go for another beer.
- Okay.

874
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:21,989
Hello, Andy.

875
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:25,457
Rolling all the girls
in the class?

876
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:30,736
- Michael EST on here?
- Michael? No.

877
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:33,510
Est very upset with you two.

878
00:58:33,545 --> 00:58:35,143
- Trey and I?
-Ya

879
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:38,014
Est sitting in the hut,
drinking beer.

880
00:58:38,049 --> 00:58:40,851
And you know what?
Not even drink beer.

881
00:58:40,886 --> 00:58:43,037
- Really?
-Ya You know what?

882
00:58:43,072 --> 00:58:45,188
You should go talk to l.

883
00:58:45,223 --> 00:58:46,621
Okay, I har.

884
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:49,759
- Go to talk to l.
- Okay.

885
00:58:49,794 --> 00:58:51,989
- Go talk to l.
- Cool.

886
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:15,016
- Michael?
- Hello.

887
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:17,417
I can get a moment?

888
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:22,124
Andy was talking to y. ..

889
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:26,558
- I said ...
- What?

890
00:59:28,265 --> 00:59:30,433
I said you were jealous
of m and Trey.

891
00:59:30,468 --> 00:59:31,422
He said that?

892
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:34,700
- It is not true?
- No.

893
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,908
S is true. I mean ...

894
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:41,843
Something as.

895
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:44,642
Michael, what happens is ...

896
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,084
- What happens is ...
- But ...

897
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,553
- But what?
- I think that can have a bug.

898
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:54,448
The save.

899
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:59,618
- What DECAS?
- You're a cool guy,

900
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:03,033
- But what happens is that Trey ...
- S?

901
01:00:03,068 --> 01:00:04,625
He is not gay.

902
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:07,960
I speak from experience.

903
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:09,805
Seriously?

904
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,073
Something as.

905
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,609
Wait.

906
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:18,847
T think am I like Trey?

907
01:00:18,882 --> 01:00:24,081
S, ESTs so jealous, because
ESTs in love with Trey.

908
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:27,055
No, no! For nothing!

909
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:29,960
My God.
Trey just wants to make a TRO

910
01:00:29,995 --> 01:00:32,594
not me, but two women.

911
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,864
I can not explain all
the crazy things ...

912
01:00:35,899 --> 01:00:40,203
and what they seem, everything
is a malinterpretacin.

913
01:00:40,238 --> 01:00:41,170
Everything.

914
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:44,302
- Wait!
- What?

915
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:47,143
I think I had enough for today.

916
01:00:47,178 --> 01:00:48,906
I have not taken any.

917
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:01,557
Wow.

918
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:04,049
I'm from the Midwest.

919
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:06,752
ESTs Why bother?

920
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:11,967
- Michael, I want to take it.
- What?

921
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:17,167
- I want to fuck me in my ass ...
- It ...

922
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,831
Big!

923
01:01:20,577 --> 01:01:22,712
- My God!
- Wait.

924
01:01:22,747 --> 01:01:24,512
Wait, stop!

925
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:28,151
- It is not what it seems.
- Sorry, I'm from the Midwest y.
..

926
01:01:28,186 --> 01:01:30,745
No, no, wait. Ven.

927
01:01:40,764 --> 01:01:41,958
- Hello.
- Hello.

928
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,133
All is well?

929
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:49,936
- Why do not we go from here?
-Ya

930
01:02:14,431 --> 01:02:15,898
You should go.

931
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,534
Or not.

932
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:23,169
Maybe we should do
this as a team.

933
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:27,977
Hi, there is enough space
here for a beaver ms.

934
01:02:28,012 --> 01:02:30,070
Hey, no!

935
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,445
Michael tena reason.

936
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:42,221
Would not have accepted anyway.

937
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,020
- Hey, Britt.
- Trey.

938
01:02:47,831 --> 01:02:49,355
We need to talk.

939
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:54,037
Did not like going to a
kickboxing competition

940
01:02:54,072 --> 01:02:57,370
in Las Vegas, tomorrow
in the morning?

941
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,049
Good night, Andy.

942
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:11,381
As you know, there are only two
days for the final competition.

943
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:13,406
Beavers, see what they have.

944
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:17,744
Trey Where is it?

945
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:22,826
Ests looking for cleaning
your man?

946
01:04:22,861 --> 01:04:25,021
Decrtelo sorry, but I abandon.

947
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,327
Forever.

948
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:29,331
Trey went to a kickboxing
competition.

949
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:33,001
What evil that can not
be kept together.

950
01:04:34,838 --> 01:04:38,842
- Well, do this without Trey.
- What? How we do it?

951
01:04:38,877 --> 01:04:40,677
We can do it. I need ...

952
01:04:40,712 --> 01:04:43,478
Desire, not make the leap.

953
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:45,915
Cinnamon and Sweetie, you
have to make that leap.

954
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:47,617
Are the techniques
that they can.

955
01:04:47,652 --> 01:04:49,141
Curse, is Marco.

956
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:51,587
He did not answer.

957
01:04:51,622 --> 01:04:52,954
- Hello.
- Bliss,

958
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:57,358
I need to come to the club.
Right now.
I do not want excuses.

959
01:04:58,127 --> 01:05:02,432
- We can not have a trial.
- S? But they have a job.

960
01:05:02,467 --> 01:05:05,492
If you want to keep, must
return to the club now.

961
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:11,708
Listen, you owe me a lot of money,
and I've stopped working.

962
01:05:11,743 --> 01:05:15,166
As you bring your asses now.

963
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:22,719
Sophie, sorry, we gotta go.

964
01:05:22,754 --> 01:05:23,685
Bliss ...

965
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:27,690
- Girls, we are sorry.
- Bliss, please ...

966
01:05:27,725 --> 01:05:31,091
- We work, sorry.
- Please!

967
01:05:39,736 --> 01:05:41,769
- Sophie, wait.
- What?

968
01:05:41,804 --> 01:05:44,329
It's over.
Debi completed long ago.

969
01:05:45,208 --> 01:05:46,507
Do not say that.

970
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:48,509
You did a good job
with the team.

971
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:50,780
You can not give up now.
You have to do it.

972
01:05:50,815 --> 01:05:52,647
It is what the beaver?

973
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:54,883
You take charge, you
adapt, you overcome.

974
01:05:54,918 --> 01:05:59,378
That serams creble if someone said
that he had not surrendered.

975
01:05:59,756 --> 01:06:02,953
You would not join the team
for a failure in your past.

976
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:05,591
Saw the video.

977
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:08,765
S. Paralyzes you. It happens.

978
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,366
It is a little worse than that.

979
01:06:11,401 --> 01:06:13,961
Not only do I froze, I froze.

980
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,836
I saw all those judges.

981
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:21,607
With black numbers,
hoping to qualify,

982
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:26,304
waiting to determine my life

983
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:30,419
my scholarship, and everything.

984
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:37,182
I did not want to
disappoint anyone.

985
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:43,163
Sure.
And you're going to use that
as an excuse to hate?

986
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:48,729
I bet that what you said
means nothing, right?

987
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:52,306
Anyway, it's too late.
Addis, Michael.

988
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:44,227
Sorry it did not work,
you worked really.

989
01:07:44,262 --> 01:07:46,286
You can be proud of it.

990
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:56,872
Bliss, Desire, Marco the need
in the darkroom now.

991
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:00,803
The devil.

992
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:11,948
Want a ride?

993
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:20,929
A cigarette?

994
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:25,026
Ms. Tilton, no s if I'm
doing the right thing.

995
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:32,008
Look, do not expect ningn advice
because I'm taking myself.

996
01:08:32,043 --> 01:08:32,975
Sure.

997
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:37,844
- Ests right?
-Ya

998
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:39,747
My God.

999
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:43,685
I want you to go ashore to walk?

1000
01:08:44,654 --> 01:08:48,021
Cario, life is a lemonade

1001
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:51,761
and sometimes you have to count
your chickens to continue.

1002
01:08:51,796 --> 01:08:54,855
- His advice is very bad.
- Thanks.

1003
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:57,399
Mira.

1004
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:02,866
I've always been beautiful, as
I can not understand you.

1005
01:09:03,673 --> 01:09:06,039
Sorry. I can not help.

1006
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:11,146
- My God, and understand.
- What?

1007
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:14,050
You are Miss Britt Simmons.

1008
01:09:14,085 --> 01:09:15,016
What?

1009
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:16,984
Had surgery on their
breasts, nose.

1010
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:19,783
Gan him to her best friends
to get ahead.

1011
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:23,182
I breast surgery and nose.

1012
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:27,223
Both tried on the computer, but
she was not good enough.

1013
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:31,067
- I'm not your Britt.
- S is.

1014
01:09:31,102 --> 01:09:32,600
And he came back
here because ...

1015
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:36,731
Because I will pay good money.

1016
01:09:37,073 --> 01:09:40,772
Or because you felt bad
all these years.

1017
01:09:40,807 --> 01:09:44,471
Well, Dr.
Freud, sometimes a
penis is a penis.

1018
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:47,674
No s qu means.

1019
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:51,080
Come on, I return to camp.

1020
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:56,156
Maybe I can go a little
more slowly.

1021
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:34,362
Ready? Vamos!

1022
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:37,298

1023

No surrender.

1026
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:47,043
What gay thing.
Go to the hut of Ms. Simmons

1027
01:10:47,078 --> 01:10:48,442

Michael? Oh, no.

1034
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:28,411
No, not what you think.

1035
01:11:28,446 --> 01:11:31,042
It is not what it
seems, I swear.

1036
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,114
Look, I want to join the team.

1037
01:11:34,991 --> 01:11:38,694
But what about your
fear paralyze you?

1038
01:11:38,729 --> 01:11:40,889
I can not promise
anything, but ...

1039
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:42,925
I want to.

1040
01:11:44,734 --> 01:11:45,723
Thanks, Michael.

1041
01:11:55,745 --> 01:11:58,646
Go to show my record at the
university to Miss Simmons!

1042
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:06,154
Thanks.

1043
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:12,022
- Hello.
- Go to hell.

1044
01:12:17,033 --> 01:12:20,662
Miss Simmons?
I come to fix your faucet.

1045
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:42,615
Cherry.

1046
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:54,668
Miss Simmons?

1047
01:12:57,273 --> 01:13:01,539
- I brought my record.

1048
01:13:02,345 --> 01:13:04,438
You dejrsela on your computer.

1049
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:08,049
Again, you pretend
to be in college?

1050
01:13:08,818 --> 01:13:11,933
Wait, I'll soon be over here,

1051
01:13:11,968 --> 01:13:15,049
AFTER maybe we can do something.

1052
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:18,359
- Something?
-Ya You know.

1053
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:22,732
Talking about college, make
a TRO, or anal sex.

1054
01:13:22,767 --> 01:13:27,233
The fact that t does
not say disgusting.

1055
01:13:27,268 --> 01:13:31,699
And you seem a nice guy,
funny, intelligent.

1056
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:35,811
- What pain you're an idiot.
- Only one oral sex.

1057
01:13:35,846 --> 01:13:37,078
That's nothing.

1058
01:13:37,113 --> 01:13:40,347
- What? Nothing?
-Ya you're a stripper.

1059
01:13:40,382 --> 01:13:43,582

1060
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:46,280

- Come on.

1061
01:14:02,338 --> 01:14:03,896
I love strippers.

1062
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,346
Do not play with me.

1063
01:14:24,894 --> 01:14:27,590
I'm not sure I like this.

1064
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:31,133
Not going to use
that with me, I?

1065
01:14:31,168 --> 01:14:33,294

1071
01:14:59,730 --> 01:15:02,960
- And Andy is waiting for you inside.
- Okay.

1072
01:15:02,995 --> 01:15:06,191
It's supposed to fix my sink.

1073
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:10,238
Bliss ...

1074
01:15:14,143 --> 01:15:15,235
Andy.

1075
01:15:15,778 --> 01:15:17,713
Ms. Simmons, I can explain.

1076
01:15:17,748 --> 01:15:19,079
This is not what it seems.

1077
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:21,878
I think that is exactly
what it seems.

1078
01:15:25,955 --> 01:15:28,150
I love those breasts.

1079
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:42,436
Gwen, ESTs ah?

1080
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:47,465
- She is not Bliss, I?
- No, Andy, is not.

1081
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:49,072
It's my mom.

1082
01:15:49,445 --> 01:15:50,503
Your mom?

1083
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:56,614
Your mam impossibly much
younger than t?

1084
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:02,850
Hi, Mom.

1085
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:06,926
Glad to see you.

1086
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:11,693
Well, est a bit chubby

1088
01:16:14,203 --> 01:16:15,568
My God.

1089
01:16:36,225 --> 01:16:38,455
S not how we do this.

1090
01:17:00,883 --> 01:17:03,078
That is, we are making good.

1091
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:29,305
- That is, go!
- Continue as.

1092
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:40,351
One moment, won the bet.

1093
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:44,917
Addis, Andy.

1094
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:50,863
We must succeed.

1095
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:55,225
Rays.

1096
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:01,239
Do not worry, I ...

1097
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:35,140
Hello, Joshua.

1098

You know? Actually I sleep.
I'll get up early.

1100
01:18:46,622 --> 01:18:50,456
Of course, for the competition tomorrow.
WhatYa

1101
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,362
Tambins should you
care that much,

1102
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:57,164
because you are an athlete.
A true athlete.

1103
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:00,802
Good night.

1104
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:04,206
S that I was wrong in your
last event of gymnastics.

1105
01:19:04,241 --> 01:19:05,730
And you lost your scholarship.

1106
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:09,773
You let your parents,
in fact everyone.

1107
01:19:11,213 --> 01:19:14,181
But it seems that you have
passed the spell.

1108
01:19:14,216 --> 01:19:17,486
And now that you have, your
coach wants you back.

1109
01:19:17,521 --> 01:19:20,819
- You have your scholarship back.
- What?

1110
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:23,783
How can you tell?

1111
01:19:27,096 --> 01:19:31,032
Are plane tickets for tonight.
How did you do this?

1112
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:35,904
As sabrs, my dad works
in the sports news.

1113
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:37,735
He has many contacts.

1114
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:43,102
That scholarship is yours,
if you go today.

1115
01:19:43,746 --> 01:19:45,577
In about ...

1116
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:47,782
an hour.

1117
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:04,131

01:20:08,372 --> 01:20:09,737

1121
01:20:09,772 --> 01:20:13,299
And we have the Beavers, a group
of very beautiful girls.

1122
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:27,816
Has anyone seen Michael?

1123
01:20:28,357 --> 01:20:32,054
Revis behind the scenes, he is not ah.
Where is it s not.

1124
01:20:32,694 --> 01:20:36,061
Receive the squirrels!

1125
01:21:01,723 --> 01:21:03,953
- They are very good.
- They are good.

1126
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,814
S will come, I Vern.

1127
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:05,343
And now there will be a break.
Back with more action.

1128
01:22:05,888 --> 01:22:09,016
You talk about Michael?
Your maintenance man?

1129
01:22:10,092 --> 01:22:12,083
No, will not come.

1130
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:14,558
Are planning to return to school

1131
01:22:14,593 --> 01:22:16,689
to get a scholarship
for gymnastics.

1132
01:22:17,733 --> 01:22:20,802
At least that's what she told me
yesterday when I was in bed.

1133
01:22:20,837 --> 01:22:25,138
Indeed we expect that, loser?

1134
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:30,577
Well, if not, how will know
you have a mole here?

1135
01:22:35,751 --> 01:22:38,584
Sorry, girls, the cheetah won.

1136
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:46,487
We will have to retire.

1137
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:50,130
I can not believe I did this.

1138
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:54,898
- As men are, honey.
- We now present the cheetahs.

1139
01:22:59,408 --> 01:23:01,467
They are the cheetahs.

1140
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:38,645

A round of applause

01:24:43,645 --> 01:24:44,612
Handkerchief?

1144

I was very exhausted and fell

Cre beans you went to your
school, your scholarship.

1155
01:25:31,394 --> 01:25:33,361
Can never do that to the team.

01:25:33,396 --> 01:25:35,295

Supralan, Britt.

1178

Besides, your dad now has another
child to worry about.
