<i>"My dear friend Foti Lianaka</i>

7
00:00:41,388 --> 00:00:44,947
<i>May I be well and the same I wish for you.</i>

8
00:00:45,465 --> 00:00:50,111
<i>And I thank you heartly for asking
me to come and work with you</i>

9
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:54,180
<i>despite your work not going well</i>

10
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:59,391
<i>I just want to be a wonderer
for a piece of bread,</i>

11
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:02,128
<i>as I've already written</i>

12
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:08,629
<i>I gave away everything I owned to a con-man</i>

13
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:13,208
<i>and I made my papers
to leave for Australia</i>

14
00:01:13,243 --> 00:01:16,971
<i>and I will be leaving by
the time Autumn comes,</i>

15
00:01:17,252 --> 00:01:20,137
<i>by a boat named "Patris".</i>

16
00:01:20,172 --> 00:01:21,610
<i>You've always been a good friend</i>

17
00:01:21,783 --> 00:01:24,069
<i>when we where both in the army</i>

18
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:28,750
<i>and when the Germans were
chasing us in our own mountains.</i>

19
00:01:30,622 --> 00:01:34,863
<i>I'm leaving my friend Foti Lianaka</i>

20
00:01:35,383 --> 00:01:40,062
<i>because bread is scarce and
it's been years since had a decent meal.</i>

21
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:45,195
<i>Work is tiresome and the times are changing.</i>

22
00:01:46,157 --> 00:01:48,859
<i>For the 4 months that I'll be with you,</i>

23
00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:53,291
<i>God be, although He knows
what a sinner I am</i>

24
00:01:53,723 --> 00:01:56,400
<i>I wish to earn some money for the voyage</i>

25
00:01:57,494 --> 00:02:02,385
<i>which they say lasts about a month.</i>

26
00:02:02,632 --> 00:02:08,510
<i>I will not visit my village because
I have no relatives left there,</i>

27
00:02:09,058 --> 00:02:14,240
<i>as you must have know
my old mom died in January.</i>

28
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,498
<i>Well, I might go the upper village</i>

29
00:02:19,728 --> 00:02:22,835
<i>to visit the grave.</i>

30
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:28,593
<i>Goodbye my friend Foti Lianaka
and I'll be joining you as soon as possible.</i>

31
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:34,555
<i>We all tumble and migrate
like rolling stones</i>

32
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:41,356
<i>and once displaced roll down the slope.</i>

33
00:02:46,061 --> 00:02:47,349
<i>I salute you,</i>

34
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:48,603
<i>Your friend</i>

35
00:02:48,638 --> 00:02:50,804
<i>Antones Niakas. "</i>

36
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:44,376
Hey you blacksmith!

37
00:04:49,024 --> 00:04:50,756
Antone Niaka?

38
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,049
Yes!

39
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:00,258
damn you.

40
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,239
Come in.

41
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,749
Here we are then,

42
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:17,149
how's work going?

43
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,844
Well there's always something to do.

44
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,505
some petals, some trackter repairing,

45
00:05:22,076 --> 00:05:25,108
I start from other villages and go on.
No one has complaints about me.

46
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,905
Is theren't a shop in the village
to drink some raki?

47
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,317
Oh no, it's an hour by foot

48
00:05:35,142 --> 00:05:37,274
No raki then, nothing.

49
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:39,622
I have some wine to offer you.

50
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,646
You seem to miss it.

51
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:51,383
We are all sinners,

52
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,411
this damned thing is craved for
when I don't have it.

53
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:56,568
It puts out something that burns me.

54
00:05:58,513 --> 00:06:00,510
It's good to be here.

55
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,999
Let's get to work then.

56
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:08,124
Don't you want to rest for a while?

57
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,491
What? Me to rest?

58
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:13,531
Grab the bellows then.

59
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:27,034
"Rich ones got poor... and got hungry,
while the ones seeking God... "

60
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:29,060
You still chant?

61
00:06:41,594 --> 00:06:56,513
"Rich ones got poor and got hungry,
while the ones seeking God... "

62
00:06:58,603 --> 00:07:00,488
Why did you leave your place?

63
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:02,384
I was in trouble, nevermind.

64
00:07:04,614 --> 00:07:07,175
In the village we have a cottage left,
you can settle there.

65
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,255
Bye. -.Bye

66
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:37,651
Antone Niaka!

67
00:07:38,912 --> 00:07:41,186
we learned that you where here,

68
00:07:41,221 --> 00:07:44,514
but you didn't come to visit your
mom's grave by the village

69
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:47,398
but I got into trouble to give you
her inheritance,

70
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:51,349
the maid of your mother,
I can't afford to feed her.

71
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:54,755
She's yours now!

72
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,945
For me? What should I do with her?

73
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,202
That's your business.

74
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:01,756
I can't even feed myself.

75
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,851
Don't worry,she'll earn her bread.

76
00:08:03,886 --> 00:08:06,241
And anyway what she does
is none of my concern.

77
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:11,527
I just took her in so she wouldn't starve to death.
Have to go now,have work to do.

78
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:21,575
Don't talk much and just accept it.

79
00:08:21,957 --> 00:08:24,527
Let's see how I should share
a piece of bread!

80
00:08:36,846 --> 00:08:38,996
You have been sitting here all day?

81
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,708
Come in then.

82
00:08:49,144 --> 00:08:51,331
Thank you sir.

83
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,832
Eat.

84
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:14,774
I see you've stopped drinking Niaka

85
00:11:15,915 --> 00:11:18,337
I'm thinking of not drinking
another sip of it.

86
00:11:19,294 --> 00:11:22,979
If only I could settle down here
and screw Australia and all that.

87
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:27,730
And if God gives us his guidance
maybe everything will turn out ok.

88
00:11:29,126 --> 00:11:31,684
So as to stop the immigration
my brother Lianaka.

89
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:35,355
My first cousin went to Germany
and he curses the day he made the decision.

90
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:42,112
Look.

91
00:11:44,142 --> 00:11:50,061
I bought her a dress, a neckerchief
and a soap. I know what a girl wants.

92
00:11:50,952 --> 00:11:52,501
Here I am sir!

93
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,226
Come, swift your hands.

94
00:14:53,011 --> 00:14:55,173
Helen will come tonight

95
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:19,156
Niaka?

96
00:15:30,694 --> 00:15:32,661
Can't you hear when you're spoken to?

97
00:15:33,994 --> 00:15:36,396
You said something?

98
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:41,318
The church will start for its summers services.
Are you going to the evening service?

99
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:45,153
Where will you go?

100
00:15:45,371 --> 00:15:47,753
Well I think I'll stay here.

101
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,723
You'll stay?

102
00:15:49,793 --> 00:15:51,006
Maybe someone will come.

103
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:52,560
On a Saturday evening who will come?

104
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,308
An order maybe.

105
00:15:56,512 --> 00:16:02,434
Well I don't know,
I'm not in the best of moods.

106
00:16:02,635 --> 00:16:05,435
I think I better dooze off in the cottage.

107
00:16:07,265 --> 00:16:09,054
So you will stay here?

108
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,298
I'd told you so, yes!

109
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:15,041
I shall go then.

110
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:26,024
Maybe you want some small money?

111
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:27,329
No need.

112
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,555
Only a penny for some raki.

113
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,952
I better go for a sleep.

114
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:50,849
Get well soon then...

115
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:25,195
Are you here?

116
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,812
Yes we're here.

117
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,669
Where's sir?

118
00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:37,472
He's around. He'll be back.

119
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:39,017
I should go then.

120
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:44,129
Stay! He'll be back soon.
We'll go to the evening service.

121
00:19:00,587 --> 00:19:02,742
Isn't the fire burning?

122
00:19:05,296 --> 00:19:07,705
It's half burning.

123
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,728
Should I fix the bellows?

124
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:12,682
Blow it if you want

125
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:37,497
Ha? The anvil is still warm.

126
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:43,488
Yes it is.

127
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,974
Lianaka, I know we are all sinners.

128
00:25:56,353 --> 00:25:58,219
You're drunk and it's only morning!

129
00:25:58,254 --> 00:26:00,086
I do no harm to anyone If I drink

130
00:26:00,818 --> 00:26:03,004
ts my money I'm drinking my earnings.

131
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:06,020
You're getting drunk that's what this,
and if you don't care of yourself...

132
00:26:06,055 --> 00:26:07,609
Oh what do you care Lianaka?

133
00:26:07,644 --> 00:26:09,129
What are you trying to say?

134
00:26:09,164 --> 00:26:10,799
I'm trying to say what you already know.

135
00:26:11,997 --> 00:26:14,599
And you know why I drink,
because I let off steam. Otherwise..

136
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,397
From what are you lettting off steam?
You've lost your mind over love?

137
00:26:18,432 --> 00:26:20,394
Lianaka!

138
00:26:41,171 --> 00:26:46,906
She's an orphan, she is alone,
she has noone except from me.

139
00:26:46,941 --> 00:26:48,577
Who's talking about orphans?

140
00:26:49,886 --> 00:26:54,677
Don't you play with me Lianaka. Don't play
with me. I'm human and have a soul.

141
00:26:54,712 --> 00:26:56,931
You're drunk like hell that's what you are!

142
00:26:56,966 --> 00:27:03,995
You're cursing me. You have no God within you.
10 years I've known you but now I'm leaving...

143
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,813
To hell!

144
00:27:05,848 --> 00:27:07,083
Pay me my workdays.

145
00:27:07,118 --> 00:27:08,948
I don't owe you any wages.

146
00:27:08,983 --> 00:27:10,025
Holy Mary!

147
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,641
There's not a dime, you get it?

148
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:11,562
Whore!

149
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,584
You didn't tell me nothing.

150
00:28:55,183 --> 00:28:57,250
You didn't say it to me clearly.

151
00:28:57,285 --> 00:28:59,302
Think of me as dead rather than alive, sir.

152
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,092
Bollocks, noone does justice to another.

153
00:29:14,223 --> 00:29:16,316
He spits you.

154
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,127
He kicks you in the throat.

155
00:29:19,931 --> 00:29:22,788
Swallow the grief and don't say a word.

156
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,843
That's it then, my brother.

157
00:30:13,547 --> 00:30:19,299
Helen, let me tell you. I'm thinking of...

158
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:30,178
You'll come too. In the evening.

159
00:30:34,108 --> 00:30:40,084
I'm thinking of going again
to the flea market. What do you think?

160
00:30:41,353 --> 00:30:42,980
Do as you please. What do you mean?

161
00:30:44,182 --> 00:30:45,696
In the evening, you come too,

162
00:30:47,754 --> 00:30:49,531
What are you trying to say?

163
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:51,309
You'll come too,right?

164
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:56,065
Careless, like you don't know anything

165
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,348
you blow the bellows

166
00:30:59,866 --> 00:31:01,877
laughing as always

167
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:04,684
you undestand?

168
00:31:07,853 --> 00:31:09,667
and I lift the hammer

169
00:31:10,058 --> 00:31:11,836
In the anvil.

170
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,847
I lift...

171
00:31:14,882 --> 00:31:17,296
so as to hit.

172
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:25,675
Don't drink any more sir,
you've drunk enough.

173
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:31,623
Death to you, dog!My friend
for 10 years, my brother.

174
00:31:37,832 --> 00:31:46,648
We are all sinners, the priest too
and so are you.

175
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:56,754
The Satan will take us all, and then we go to Australia
and I'll take you with me forever.

176
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:08,984
And you, you little poor...
Why am I waiting? I'm coming Lianaka!

177
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,459
Somebody is at the door.

178
00:32:15,129 --> 00:32:17,078
Open up it's me.

179
00:32:24,662 --> 00:32:27,770
Go and open the door.

180
00:32:37,821 --> 00:32:39,621
I'm here Niaka.

181
00:32:48,379 --> 00:32:52,886
I know about the hour but... Good evening.

182
00:32:55,905 --> 00:32:57,759
I came here to tell you.

183
00:33:00,752 --> 00:33:02,593
Just listen

184
00:33:08,768 --> 00:33:10,595
You're not talking?

185
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,881
Maybe you don't want me to come in?

186
00:33:17,597 --> 00:33:21,485
Lianaka is that you?

187
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:26,209
Come in then

188
00:33:35,943 --> 00:33:39,530
I apologize Niaka I've done you wrong.

189
00:33:39,565 --> 00:33:41,058
Yes I know.

190
00:33:41,945 --> 00:33:46,049
You nearly hit me with a hammer on the head.

191
00:33:52,304 --> 00:33:55,832
Come in then, noone is killing you.

192
00:33:57,358 --> 00:34:03,593
Im not saying you're killing me,
sometime ago you loved me. Well things happen.

193
00:34:13,896 --> 00:34:16,002
I came to talk Niaka.

194
00:34:49,913 --> 00:34:51,896
Here, take.

195
00:34:53,942 --> 00:34:56,120
Goodnight.

196
00:34:58,866 --> 00:35:00,832
Goodnight Helen.

197
00:35:10,298 --> 00:35:11,902
Helen!

198
00:35:13,426 --> 00:35:14,908
An engagement!

199
00:35:29,262 --> 00:35:31,640
And I was thinking of settling down...

200
00:35:42,012 --> 00:35:44,243
I'll prepare for you all that I have

201
00:35:46,525 --> 00:35:49,699
and then I'll head off to prepare
for my ship that'll take me to Australia.

202
00:35:52,362 --> 00:35:54,487
I wanted him sir.

203
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:36,045
Hey Nanota! Where are you? Nanota.

204
00:39:23,931 --> 00:39:29,112
Where has the dirty female gone to?

205
00:39:29,497 --> 00:39:32,542
Watch out George,
so we don't have a great misfortune.

206
00:39:32,577 --> 00:39:34,395
Nanota is in heat.

207
00:39:36,045 --> 00:39:38,525
Don't you see how she is drooling
when she sees a man?

208
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,011
Be it an old, young or middle-aged man.

209
00:39:42,976 --> 00:39:45,049
She needs someone to guard her all the time.

210
00:39:57,069 --> 00:39:59,026
Hey sir?

211
00:39:59,613 --> 00:40:01,759
What you'll know!
He's just like Saint Vlasios

212
00:40:05,085 --> 00:40:07,721
They are callng you.

213
00:40:08,366 --> 00:40:10,239
Why don't you respond?

214
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:12,284
They never leave me alone.
Im fed up with them.

215
00:40:17,602 --> 00:40:21,713
They either watch their goats
or their female.

216
00:40:21,748 --> 00:40:24,028
Hello.

217
00:40:24,063 --> 00:40:26,663
Where are you heading to?

218
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:27,640
Australia.

219
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:28,882
There goes another. We've been ruined.

220
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,950
Where are you from?

221
00:40:30,985 --> 00:40:31,995
From the hills up.

222
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,700
I need a helping hand for 20 days
and can't find one.

223
00:40:38,354 --> 00:40:40,423
Is there a shop around here
so to drink some raki?

224
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:43,533
I have some raki my friend, second to none.

225
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,667
Why don't you stay so
to finish that small barrel together?

226
00:40:53,354 --> 00:40:55,319
You'll also have a wage on top of that.

227
00:40:57,522 --> 00:41:03,299
Well do some gardening, some pests
to get rid of, just plain choirs.

228
00:41:05,747 --> 00:41:07,762
I'll stay, for a while.

229
00:41:29,914 --> 00:41:31,592
Hello Nanota.

230
00:41:31,627 --> 00:41:33,271
Hello to you too.

231
00:41:34,347 --> 00:41:36,223
Do you want to go for a ride in the city?

232
00:41:36,258 --> 00:41:38,099
Go to hell bastard. I'm fine as I am.

233
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,515
Has anyone kissed you?

234
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:47,270
Nanota! What do we have here again?

235
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:49,860
Didn't we tell you
we don't want talking and laughing?

236
00:41:50,814 --> 00:41:52,662
Why do you keep roaming around?

237
00:41:52,697 --> 00:41:56,139
So as these low-life will find you
alone and get you in trouble?

238
00:41:56,174 --> 00:41:59,582
And what will they do to me?
They'll eat me? What do you care?

239
00:42:00,173 --> 00:42:02,358
You look after for the goats
and leave me alone.

240
00:42:03,561 --> 00:42:05,860
Let's go now.

241
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:07,945
I'm not going anywhere.

242
00:42:36,455 --> 00:42:41,216
Father! Nanota will get knocked up.
She's out and about again.

243
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:57,890
And it's high, really high, rocks.

244
00:43:05,567 --> 00:43:07,656
And it's different,
how should I describe it?

245
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:12,617
Has a nice view. It's different there.

246
00:43:38,903 --> 00:43:40,855
Where were you?

247
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:43,806
Can't you see? Are you blind?

248
00:43:43,841 --> 00:43:45,482
I'm not buything these!

249
00:44:48,935 --> 00:44:52,823
Nanota, Nanota! Where are you?

250
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:18,209
Hey Nanota.

251
00:45:55,232 --> 00:45:59,029
Drink, drink. I'll tell you. There's one
over there. Come. Can't you listen?

252
00:46:26,649 --> 00:46:27,894
I'm listening

253
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:32,208
My heart is going to explode.

254
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,666
Here too.

255
00:46:49,956 --> 00:46:51,626
Here too.

256
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,044
Here too.

257
00:46:57,912 --> 00:46:59,960
Here too.

258
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:09,882
What are you doing?

259
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:13,451
Let her get knocked up. I don't give a dime.

260
00:47:26,101 --> 00:47:28,335
Hey you, what did he did to you?

261
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:30,676
Nothing what could he do?

262
00:47:30,711 --> 00:47:32,977
And why did he run when he show me?

263
00:47:33,012 --> 00:47:35,244
How would I know? Go and ask him.

264
00:47:35,279 --> 00:47:37,632
And why are you lying down?

265
00:47:39,227 --> 00:47:44,351
I was sleeping. I was sleeping for some time.
I laid down to rest and I fall asleep.

266
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:49,279
And then why were you yelling? I heard you.
He did something to you.

267
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:53,488
He threw me a pebble and I got scared.
What are you thinking of?

268
00:47:57,639 --> 00:47:59,821
OK, let's go home.

269
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:22,397
By pure luck we avoided getting into trouble.
It's a good thing I arrived at time.

270
00:49:33,899 --> 00:49:36,394
Damned you girl, are you in a daze?

271
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:40,580
Are you sick?

272
00:49:43,186 --> 00:49:46,127
What are you doing still there?
It's almost midday.

273
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:58,269
There's no bread, George ate it.

274
00:49:59,144 --> 00:50:00,563
He's gone to get some back. Wait.

275
00:50:00,782 --> 00:50:02,096
Don't grope!

276
00:50:02,131 --> 00:50:03,471
I'm hungry what do you want me to do?

277
00:50:03,506 --> 00:50:07,497
Go to hell! Go to hell!

278
00:51:18,327 --> 00:51:20,399
Can I have a sip?

279
00:51:20,434 --> 00:51:21,999
It's midday it will give you a headache.

280
00:51:27,206 --> 00:51:29,337
I made a promise no to come here again.

281
00:51:29,372 --> 00:51:31,468
The best thing you could do is that.

282
00:51:31,981 --> 00:51:34,632
I'll stay one more time.
Only today and never again.

283
00:51:38,959 --> 00:51:40,662
Only today.

284
00:52:37,677 --> 00:52:41,870
Nanota, where are you? Nanota.

285
00:53:14,129 --> 00:53:16,429
Well, well, well.

286
00:53:22,051 --> 00:53:23,927
Come here nice girl.

287
00:53:25,036 --> 00:53:26,266
Come!.

288
00:55:38,506 --> 00:55:49,407
Hey Nanota. Where are you?
Hey Nanota. Nanota.

289
00:56:06,419 --> 00:56:08,326
She is an orphan

290
00:56:09,293 --> 00:56:11,112
she has noone except me

291
00:56:14,439 --> 00:56:16,218
we are all sinners.

292
00:56:17,446 --> 00:56:19,211
even the priest.

293
00:56:23,469 --> 00:56:26,232
This damned thing is craved for
when I don't have it.

294
00:56:26,267 --> 00:56:28,977
It puts out something that burns me.

295
00:56:32,531 --> 00:56:33,895
Houses,

296
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:38,685
manors.

297
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:41,939
palaces.

298
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:45,322
And there I will tell them:

299
00:56:45,613 --> 00:56:46,856
Me...

300
00:56:48,269 --> 00:56:49,932
...kut my got

301
00:56:53,328 --> 00:56:56,074
And that will mean in Australian:

302
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:59,382
My heart has hurt

303
00:57:02,064 --> 00:57:03,659
a lot.

304
00:58:19,363 --> 00:58:21,745
When is the ship leaving, compatriot?

305
00:58:24,137 --> 00:58:25,652
In 4 days.

306
00:58:25,687 --> 00:58:27,793
Know of a cheap hotel here?

307
00:58:32,158 --> 00:58:35,414
Why don't you come home for 50 drachmas?
I have a small kitchen.

308
00:58:36,087 --> 00:58:37,338
Thank you.

309
00:59:37,588 --> 00:59:38,897
Here.

310
01:00:05,695 --> 01:00:07,816
My wife isn't home yet, but don't worry.

311
01:00:57,489 --> 01:00:59,443
What did they want you?

312
01:01:01,495 --> 01:01:03,444
After 2 years at last
they remembered about it.

313
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:09,350
My papers are ready,
I can leave for Australia.

314
01:01:09,451 --> 01:01:11,451
<i>song playing:"I'm leaving with sorrow for foreign lands"</i>

315
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:14,133
And why don't you leave?

316
01:01:14,158 --> 01:01:16,128
And the house? Where will you go?

317
01:01:26,662 --> 01:01:28,175
We've talked about it.

318
01:01:33,904 --> 01:01:35,511
Go to sleep now.

319
01:01:43,406 --> 01:01:45,099
Let me prepare you a cup of coffee.

320
01:01:45,756 --> 01:01:49,538
No, no need. I'll go to the shop
nearby to drink some raki.

321
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:55,126
But because the ship
leaves early in the morning.

322
01:01:56,393 --> 01:01:58,341
I'll come by midday to lie down for a while.

323
01:01:59,699 --> 01:02:01,994
I'm a stranger you see, I know nobody here.

324
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:16,957
It's you?

325
01:04:16,992 --> 01:04:19,302
Yes, I brought you a watermelon.

326
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:23,043
Shut up god damn it!

327
01:04:23,078 --> 01:04:24,599
I'm melting.

328
01:04:24,955 --> 01:04:26,619
I brought it so you could cool down.

329
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:27,970
Will you shut up?

330
01:05:30,535 --> 01:05:33,432
For fuck's sake, in the heat of the midday!

331
01:06:19,664 --> 01:06:21,865
Aren't you sleeping?

332
01:06:24,168 --> 01:06:25,468
No

333
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:31,323
I hadn't believed it.
I see you packed everything.

334
01:10:56,139 --> 01:10:57,993
What time is it?

335
01:11:02,728 --> 01:11:06,055
What do you need it? Where are you going?

336
01:11:09,466 --> 01:11:11,244
Where am I going?

337
01:11:12,782 --> 01:11:14,365
Like I know where I'll go.

338
01:11:16,532 --> 01:11:18,358
Like I have somewhere to go.

339
01:11:18,629 --> 01:11:20,398
To hell! That's where I'm going.

340
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:22,692
At least you're aware of it.

341
01:11:22,727 --> 01:11:24,560
And what do you want me to do?

342
01:11:24,595 --> 01:11:26,650
To have you over my head all my life?

343
01:11:26,685 --> 01:11:29,403
-.Like it was bad for you.
-.Yes I know I know, go to hell.

344
01:11:29,427 --> 01:11:30,875
Why do you keep bringing it up all the time?

345
01:11:30,930 --> 01:11:33,097
And for a matter of fact
that's why I'm leaving.

346
01:11:34,563 --> 01:11:36,805
I don't want to keep hearing that
I sit around so as to spend your money.

347
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,440
Which money?

348
01:11:38,475 --> 01:11:40,107
The ones that've been left, it's the same.

349
01:11:40,142 --> 01:11:42,868
Don't start again.

350
01:11:42,903 --> 01:11:46,579
Ok ok you've been a good housekeeper
and all these.

351
01:11:47,205 --> 01:11:50,562
I'm tired,
please let me leave with some decency.

352
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:53,117
It would have been better
if we were together.

353
01:11:53,152 --> 01:11:54,999
I've heard that a thousand times.

354
01:11:55,034 --> 01:11:56,932
Shut up I'm not in the mood.

355
01:11:56,967 --> 01:12:00,929
And when are you in the mood for listening?
All you do is talk and only when it's about you.

356
01:12:00,947 --> 01:12:02,995
You see, that's how you are.

357
01:12:03,576 --> 01:12:05,500
There's nothing you don't answer.

358
01:12:06,002 --> 01:12:08,463
Always have something to say last

359
01:12:08,498 --> 01:12:10,229
Like a stab.

360
01:12:10,264 --> 01:12:12,521
Even today that...

361
01:12:12,959 --> 01:12:14,753
At least today I thought you would shut up.

362
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,535
When were you right so I would shut up?

363
01:12:16,536 --> 01:12:17,847
Will you shut up?!

364
01:12:17,882 --> 01:12:21,052
I'm not afraid of you
so don't you shout at me.

365
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:23,145
You'll make me hit my head on the wall.

366
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:25,216
You are going to,either way.

367
01:12:25,604 --> 01:12:27,476
For your looks?

368
01:12:28,664 --> 01:12:30,585
Have you seen your face in the mirror?

369
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:34,412
A cock-roach like you
should wash my feet with your tongue.

370
01:12:34,779 --> 01:12:37,175
And if you want the truth,
that's why I'm leaving.

371
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:39,320
I'm fed up of been told I have you
just for your money.

372
01:12:39,639 --> 01:12:42,554
That's what they say you know that?
And I'm embarassed.

373
01:12:42,589 --> 01:12:45,469
You are embarassed?
Well it sure doesn't seem like it.

374
01:13:08,629 --> 01:13:11,811
See what you've done?
You've broken my balls.

375
01:13:34,651 --> 01:13:36,787
The hillbilly is sleeping?

376
01:13:40,557 --> 01:13:42,655
Won't you close the door?

377
01:13:43,048 --> 01:13:44,554
There's no wind anyway.

378
01:14:44,601 --> 01:14:46,513
Won't you take off the robe?

379
01:16:16,523 --> 01:16:17,831
Don't leave.

380
01:18:12,377 --> 01:18:13,927
Bye

381
01:18:17,334 --> 01:18:19,575
Don't think that I don't care about you.

382
01:20:03,436 --> 01:20:05,539
Do you know anyone in Australia?

383
01:20:06,921 --> 01:20:10,860
Me? No, I know nobody there.

384
01:20:10,895 --> 01:20:14,324
Me neither. But what can you do?

385
01:20:18,356 --> 01:20:20,682
Your papers?

386
01:20:22,641 --> 01:20:25,157
It's all ready.

387
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:28,350
Except something that's left to pay.

388
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:44,718
I have to pay it on board the ship.

389
01:20:50,396 --> 01:20:52,143
I see.

390
01:22:32,964 --> 01:22:35,005
Don't drink anymore, you've drunk enough.

391
01:22:35,405 --> 01:22:37,609
So what?

392
01:22:49,782 --> 01:22:51,030
Let's go.

393
01:22:52,305 --> 01:22:58,325
