2
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,166
Cat!

3
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:01,236
- Hold on a minute.
- Hey, you already owe me forty.

4
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,339
Don't worry, new business just arrived.

5
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:09,745
- Be smart, they're watching her.
- It's going to be a very delicate job.

6
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,184
If I were you, I wouldn't get involved.
They've got their eye on her constantly.

7
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,156
Each professión has its own risks.

8
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,118
GOD IS LOVE

9
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:11,534
- Come on. Move to the back.
- What? Are both of them coming?

10
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,804
Are you saying "no"?

11
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,279
- I'll be in the back with the oranges?
- Well, of course.

12
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,348
You prick.

13
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,015
People around here are the coolest, huh?

14
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,848
Throw me a bone, brother!

15
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,515
Come on. You don't want to, huh?

16
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,070
If you want to go up top.
It's OK by me.

17
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,370
I'll go there too,
so they're not alone.

18
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:27,441
Hey, I'm your buddy.
Move, get in.

19
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,707
- You are such a prick.
- Get in there!

20
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,068
Pay for as many as you want.

21
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,582
These fuckin' chow hounds.

22
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,982
They chew more than you do.

23
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:11,224
But to pull a fast one on me.
That's tough.

24
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:03,130
It's OK. We're going to do it.

25
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,610
I'm gonna take off my pants.

26
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:34,031
Little sister, you don't have to worry
anymore.

27
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,694
- I'm out of danger and I'll be good.
- Seriously?

28
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:40,261
Seriously. I promise.

29
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:44,377
I really wanted to hear you say that.
You are so crazy.

30
00:10:44,412 --> 00:10:45,935
You make me so happy.

31
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:50,608
Yes, I will follow the doctor's
instructions. Rest for a month.

32
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:55,037
Three months. You'll go to
the Randall's yacht and rest.

33
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:59,392
They'll be away from Mexico
and they want you to use it.

34
00:10:59,427 --> 00:11:02,225
- And where is it?
- In Isla Mujeres.

35
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:51,444
See, Francisco? If you were a shark,
you'd be surrounded by gringas.

36
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:53,002
- Go to school!
- OK.

37
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,070
OK, OK. You never make it.

38
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,945
Oh, my goodness.

39
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,946
Be careful, gorgeous,
because it'll eat your foot.

40
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:23,131
- Hey, Redhead.
- What's going on?

41
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,803
They called. Some people will
come to the boat.

42
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,481
Shit. We have such a great time
when nobody comes.

43
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:30,813
- When do they arrive?
- Today. By plane.

44
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,477
Shit! We barely have any time
to go price the sharks.

45
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:38,952
Let me fix the boat. You go sell them.
Then go pick them up.

46
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,392
In Mexico they sell it
like Norwegian cod.

47
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:53,131
- Like bacalao?
- Like bacalao?

48
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,439
The one that bit you, Blondie.
Tintorera.

49
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,943
- What do you say the name was?
- Tintorera.

50
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,404
Americans like you call it
"tiger shark".

51
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,750
Bye!

52
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:11,282
Stupid Americans, they should
speak in English.

53
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,358
TINTORERA

54
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:24,352
- Somebody will come to fix the boat.
- No, I want to be alone.

55
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:32,401
- Wow, it's bigger than I expected.
- And she's quite a seafarer too.

56
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:39,010
- Which cabin would you like to use?
- The main one, of course. He's alone.

57
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:42,377
- Would you like me to hang your things?
- Please.

58
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,513
The main, OK?

59
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:50,623
- Would you like a drink?
- Good idea. Pour me a whisky.

60
00:14:50,658 --> 00:14:52,147
There's no whisky.

61
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,317
- Vodka?
- There isn't any, either.

62
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:58,022
- Rum?
- Not even. There is none.

63
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,892
- So, what is there?
- Good will. There isn't even coffee.

64
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:05,630
But if you'd like a drink,
all you have to do is buy it.

65
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:25,317
With all this food we can sail around
the worid, Blondie.

66
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,522
If you want to go sail,
you need to let Julian know.

67
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:34,225
- So he hires a skipper and a seaman.
- I'm not planning to sail.

68
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,426
I came to rest and to be alone.

69
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,495
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Yes, sir.

70
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:44,167
- Some ice.
- Ice?

71
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,677
Some ice.

72
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:52,617
You know what?
I also want to ask you a favor.

73
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:56,485
- What about?
- I go shark fishing to make some cash.

74
00:15:56,555 --> 00:16:00,693
At night I go to the trap, and in the
morning I get those that got caught.

75
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:04,686
I need to take the engine
from the rubber boat.

76
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,134
- You'll take the engine and a passenger.
- A passenger?

77
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,579
We made it. This is my shark trap.

78
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:29,384
- A lot of people catch shark here?
- No. Just my brothers and I.

79
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,423
But they only do it in the season.

80
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,618
They prefer another kind of fishing,
which gives more.

81
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:38,118
You mean there's a season with more
sharks?

82
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:42,133
That's right. When the dogfish arrives,
they come behind them.

83
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,034
- Would you help me?
- What do I have to do?

84
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,164
Lift them up. The ones that got caught
are on their way.

85
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,246
It's a lemon shark.

86
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,759
It looks dead. But just in case I'm
gonna beat it in the head. Hold it.

87
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,667
Hold it tight, Blondie!

88
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,533
This one is gone.
Help me with the other one.

89
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,745
- Pull it out!
- I'm trying!

90
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:10,186
- That one is pretty much alive.
- It's the other one. Pull!

91
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,190
Pull it out, Blondie! Quick.
He's eating it.

92
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,692
The tiger shark screwed us.

93
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,795
He took more than half in one bite.

94
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,823
But tonight he'll get caught and we'll
get the son of a bitch in the morning.

95
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,807
I told you he chewed half of it.
Just look a that!

96
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:48,487
Killing these animals makes me sad,
even if they're sharks.

97
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,824
That's because you don't know them.

98
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:55,725
I'd rather sit in the sun and
look at the sharks in bikinis.

99
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,218
- Here's what you ordered.
- Bring it over there.

100
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:33,689
Share them with the guys. Don't drink it
all yourself or you'll lose your job.

101
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:51,258
But don't just stand there, old man.
Sit down.

102
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,352
Hey, why don't you forget
the invitation and get lost?

103
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,486
- I'm not speaking to you.
- But I am speaking to you.

104
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,460
Vanish, get lost, disappear.

105
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:26,862
As we say in Mexico,
you're the third wheel, asshole.

106
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:34,001
Yeah, I know you're a mean guy.
But get lost before I kick your ass.

107
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,932
Get up if you're a man.

108
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:11,339
I'll see you around, old man.
Give my best to the family!

109
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,954
Redhead!

110
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:43,871
- Pack my stuff. Get my bill from Julian.
- OK.

111
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,512
Happy homecoming.

112
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,520
- Stupid.
- It started to rain on me, Blondie.

113
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,529
He always gets pissed off at the beach.

114
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,532
- Do you think I can get a ride out?
- Maybe yes, maybe no.

115
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:17,566
Asshole! Happy homecoming.

116
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:23,070
"Old man"? Idiot!
But he's my same age.

117
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,615
This one is going insane.

118
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,528
Tell me one thing, Redhead.

119
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,360
Do you think I'm stupid?

120
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,168
I'm really bad at pegging people.

121
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:49,640
Well, I am. I'm so stupid,
I lost an amazing woman.

122
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:54,043
I'm so stupid, I almost did
what that guy wants.

123
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,982
Unpack and hang everything up again.

124
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:09,423
Shit. This would even piss off
a hermit crab.

125
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,532
I get 3.25 for two pounds of meat.

126
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,732
I get 3.40 for each feet of skin.

127
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:06,335
And the fins, Blondie,
they give me 7 pesos for two pounds.

128
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,683
- Would you like to be a farmer?
- No way.

129
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,754
- Why?
- Because it's a tough and difficult job.

130
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:20,986
Plus, they always have problems.
It doesn't rain, or it rains too much.

131
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,357
I'd rather be a fisherman.

132
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:26,454
The sea may give you just enough
to eat. But it always gives.

133
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,056
- Have you ever been to Mexico city?
- Never.

134
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:33,160
- Would you like to?
- What am I gonna do among such crowds?

135
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:38,470
You're here because you need to rest.
Like everyone else visiting the island.

136
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:41,011
Looking for the sea, the air, the sun.

137
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,673
I've got all that since I was born.

138
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,280
What's going on, old man?
You don't want to fight?

139
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,944
Let's go to the beach so you're
in your element.

140
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,251
Now, if you want to have a seat,
take a chair. You're invited.

141
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:15,917
Do you always show off
by being a clown?

142
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:19,360
You scared me, man.
What did you want me to do?

143
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:27,596
- Would you stop with that crap?
- Then stop asking.

144
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:32,041
Look, we're not going to fight every
time we see each other.

145
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:34,870
You owe me and you're going to pay.

146
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:40,042
But all in time. Now let's be friends,
OK?

147
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,053
- What's your name?
- Steve.

148
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,352
I hate it when people use me
for their jokes.

149
00:39:02,387 --> 00:39:04,667
Come on, man. Are we gonna go at it
again?

150
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:08,075
Catch the vibe.

151
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:15,946
Have a look at them. I'll give you
the one you like the most.

152
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,089
This one has a sensational butt.

153
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,089
But this one's got a pair of boobs,
that are from another worid.

154
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:35,106
- And what's your name?
- Miguel.

155
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:36,971
- ¿Cierto?
- Cierto.

156
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,116
- Would you like anything else?
- No, thanks.

157
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:03,491
- See you later.
- See you later, Missy.

158
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:20,812
- Pedrito.
- One beer.

159
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:25,954
Would you like something?

160
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:30,357
A snail ceviche, a grouper sandwich
and a cold beer.

161
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:34,558
- Do you want to eat anything?
- No, thanks. But I'll hang out.

162
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:36,929
Get another beer.

163
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:41,638
Patricia left yesterday. She disappeared
without a word.

164
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:45,108
She got tired of the vacation,
went back to her nest.

165
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,076
I don't care.

166
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:55,179
Do you know she is in love with you?

167
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,756
I already told you that I don't care.

168
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:08,192
Don't be stubborn, old man.

169
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,193
I don't like to be called "old."

170
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:18,608
Don't think I'm arrogant, old man.

171
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:22,942
But I'm one those fortunate men
that women like.

172
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:38,221
I know you don't like me much.
But let me finish.

173
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,977
I didn't make an impressión on Pat.

174
00:41:42,012 --> 00:41:44,724
When she told me she had come alone

175
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:47,203
but that she had found somebody here,

176
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:51,072
I expected it a gringo, Finnish
or somebody from the Check Republic.

177
00:41:54,745 --> 00:42:00,706
I thought you were a millionaire.
Bold, old, ugly.

178
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:05,244
But then I saw you and I knew
there was nothing for me to do.

179
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:09,051
You struck me as an experienced man,

180
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:13,654
used to the best restaurants,
the best wine,

181
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:17,167
used to the best females in bed.

182
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:20,260
But as soon as you opened your mouth,

183
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:24,032
I said to myself, "I'm taking this
asshole's old lady."

184
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:28,603
I pushed your buttons on purpose,
and you fell for it.

185
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,842
I knew I could make you hit the ceiling.

186
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:35,784
But I wasn't going to screw up
like that. I know.

187
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,879
I know you practice karate,
that you beat Kun Fu,

188
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,652
and Joe Louis and Mohammed, together.

189
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,250
I was going to fall at your first blow.

190
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:49,588
This is like "Little Red Riding Hood"
and her basket of stories.

191
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,727
Then came the big bad wolf and, boom!

192
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:55,033
He ate her.

193
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:58,836
What did surprise me was
that handful of sand in my eyes.

194
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,811
But that was what brought you down,
and me up.

195
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:09,576
That is to say, it took you out
of her bed, to get me in it.

196
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:16,687
You know, she didn't make love
with me. She did it with you.

197
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,696
I mean, thinking about you.

198
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,789
Why are telling me all this?

199
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:27,097
Because I know it hurts you.
It's revenge.

200
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:30,766
Just as that handful of sand
in my eyes hurt me.

201
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:32,968
Now we're even on that.

202
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:36,240
I only need to get back at you for
that left hook you threw at my face.

203
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:37,974
It was a right hook.

204
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:08,432
Hey, Professor. Where's your deal?

205
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:05,893
Come here, man!

206
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:29,190
What's up with them
naked over there?

207
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:33,199
They went to look for their clothes.

208
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,568
They'll be back with all their stuff.

209
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,937
And probably with the hotel bill, too.

210
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:47,548
- Miguel, what do you do for a living?
- I live.

211
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,722
- Right. What do you live off?
- Off my body.

212
00:49:51,757 --> 00:49:54,122
Are you saying you exploit women?

213
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:59,186
Well, exploit them,
truly exploit them...

214
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:02,390
...sometimes, yes.
And sometimes, no.

215
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:06,698
Sometimes I get into some bad deals and
I have to support them, brother.

216
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:10,298
Look, I am on vacation here.

217
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:13,709
I usually operate in Acapulco, Vallarta,
Zihuatanejo.

218
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:17,111
The Pacific Coast, where
the money is. I come here to rest.

219
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:21,344
- May I ask you something?
- Of course! I'm a walking encyclopedia.

220
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:23,545
Do you know what you're gonna do
in the future?

221
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,220
Of course.

222
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,952
First, I'm gonna get my clothes
from the beach.

223
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,728
And you also have to get yours...

224
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:37,291
...which you left on the beach to go
swimming naked with strangers.

225
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,632
Come on, now. Let's go.

226
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,748
Hey, should we take
the small sail boat?

227
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:55,752
- Or do we just swim over there?
- It's up to you.

228
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:10,994
I'll make a bet with you.

229
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,559
I bet I'll make it first to the beach.

230
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:33,822
We dive at the count of three.

231
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:02,175
- It's not fair. You brought your fins.
- What fins, asshole?

232
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:06,154
Well, with such big feet, you seem
Cro-Magnon.

233
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:09,124
It was a draw.

234
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:12,525
No, no. You won. What's fair is fair.

235
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:18,066
Plus, I was getting too deep in the
ocean, on your boat.

236
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:22,094
I need to be on solid ground. I'll go
into business administration.

237
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:24,868
With a gringa I already have my eye on.

238
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:31,229
What do you say, Redhead?
Should we?

239
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:17,180
Redhead!

240
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:35,395
Redhead!

241
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:42,433
- What the hell is going on here?
- The giris brought some friends.

242
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:29,950
Hey, Captain! How's the good life?

243
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:34,115
- Resting and getting some sun.
- Cool!

244
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:44,327
Luxurious like the ones
at the Hammacka Hilton.

245
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:48,394
But all of them are sensational.
Oh, mamma.

246
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:51,599
Are these the hippies of the hotel
by the cemetery?

247
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:52,800
Yes, my man.

248
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:59,074
They are all very beautiful.

249
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:01,674
Beautiful and hungry.

250
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:04,743
But today I don't have the strength
to even look at them.

251
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,755
What do you say we eat and leave?

252
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:10,020
Pablito! Conquí!

253
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:15,130
I have a surprise for you, man.

254
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:17,998
- Another?
- It's not what you think.

255
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:22,060
I'll take you scuba-diving
to a new spot. Nice and difficult.

256
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:25,039
People call it "the big caves."

257
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,941
- Have you already been there?
- No. Are we going?

258
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:32,539
I want to see you walk your talk
over there, Professor.

259
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,545
This is lethal.

260
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:14,948
- What's this rod for?
- That's the surprise I've got for you.

261
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:16,992
You'll see down below.

262
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,221
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

263
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:30,963
Let's rock 'n' roll.

264
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:31,212
Beautiful animal.

265
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:32,982
It's a good size.

266
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:36,424
Now we're even.

267
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,422
The contest is three shots.

268
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:23,226
I'm going down to get it.
Give me that hook.

269
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:26,063
Pull when I give you the signal.

270
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:41,442
Not that way!

271
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:43,542
It's over on this side!

272
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:17,151
- How did you know it wouldn't get us?
- We had a wounded barracuda.

273
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:18,777
If not, you gotta watch out.

274
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,050
Sharks always attack wounded victims.

275
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:24,115
The wounded animal's vibrations
attract the shark.

276
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,252
Why did you swim over there to catch it?

277
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:28,388
The currents in the bottom are strong.

278
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:30,591
If dive in, they take me far
from the animal.

279
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:34,826
It's good to have everything clear.
Tomorrow is my turn.

280
01:05:25,054 --> 01:05:27,022
She's alone and looking for action.

281
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:30,987
How can you be so sure?

282
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:37,956
No man makes a woman wait for more
than ten or fifteen minutes,

283
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:41,333
which means she is alone.
She's not waiting for anybody.

284
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:48,667
I bet you I'll go to bed with her
before you do.

285
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:54,013
That's a bet I wouldn't want to lose.

286
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,641
Let's go?

287
01:05:56,686 --> 01:06:00,383
- Where?
- What do you mean? To get her.

288
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,151
Come on.

289
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:29,313
Sit down. Sit down.

290
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:45,059
Yes, one tequila.

291
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:50,705
- Two tequilas.
- Three tequilas.

292
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:21,066
You're looking good, old man.
You're looking good.

293
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,643
- Please...
- Good evening.

294
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:38,313
It's too bad she didn't want to come.

295
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:45,153
She can't decide with whom to go
to bed. This girl's a professional.

296
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:50,183
- Do you think she's a whore?
- No, man. Don't get mixed up.

297
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:52,750
This girl doesn't open her legs
for money.

298
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:54,762
She does it for fun or interest.

299
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,661
A calculated interest, of course.

300
01:08:56,732 --> 01:09:00,099
She's interested in me and likes me
more. But you throw her off.

301
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:03,605
I'm sure she wants to know
more about us.

302
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:08,200
What's more, I could say she thinks
we're gay.

303
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:28,983
Grab this.

304
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:56,669
It's a tiger shark.
Let's go to the boat.

305
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:13,846
What do you think?

306
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:16,441
I bet she's already made a decisión.

307
01:14:16,518 --> 01:14:18,418
Stop with the bets.

308
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:22,180
We'd better wait and see.

309
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,904
The vibe is getting folkloric.

310
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:03,718
My head.

311
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:42,121
This squid stew will be delicious.

312
01:22:59,174 --> 01:23:04,043
- Are you married?
- In one way, almost. In another, a bit.

313
01:23:04,112 --> 01:23:05,477
I don't understand.

314
01:23:11,353 --> 01:23:14,254
Very complicated, isn't it?

315
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:18,692
I think we've gone too far.

316
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:21,924
Sometimes when we're in bed
with Gabriella,

317
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:25,023
I get scared and I wonder how far
we've gone.

318
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:28,565
I think we're going beyond
all limits.

319
01:23:28,636 --> 01:23:31,196
Your limits; life doesn't have any.

320
01:23:31,272 --> 01:23:34,298
We make the boundaries.

321
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:37,174
You're falling in love with Gabriella.

322
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:41,439
If that's true, then I'll vanish
and she is yours.

323
01:23:46,755 --> 01:23:50,054
No. It's not that.

324
01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:55,061
I can't deny I'm madly attracted
to her special view of life.

325
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:57,963
She's a wild animal
that can't adapt to a cage.

326
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:02,493
She's trying to indoctrinate us
on her habits of sexual freedom.

327
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:04,037
That's all.

328
01:24:10,745 --> 01:24:13,373
The thing is, I'm not even jealous
when she's with you.

329
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:18,313
On the contrary, I like what she does.

330
01:24:19,654 --> 01:24:22,020
And that's precisely what frightens me.

331
01:24:49,517 --> 01:24:53,317
They're coming! Prepare the champagne!

332
01:24:55,523 --> 01:24:58,492
OK. Do you want anything else?
I'm leaving to set my traps.

333
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,028
No, thanks. No.

334
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:16,768
You know what?

335
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:20,508
I think we're creating something new
in this country.

336
01:25:20,582 --> 01:25:22,311
Are we? What it is?

337
01:25:22,383 --> 01:25:28,481
In Mexico, it is customary for a man
to have a number of women,

338
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:30,183
but never together.

339
01:25:30,258 --> 01:25:32,556
The famous "big house"
and "small house"?

340
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:35,494
That's right. However,

341
01:25:35,563 --> 01:25:38,191
you and I
do it the other way around.

342
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:42,259
We live together in this floating cave.

343
01:25:42,337 --> 01:25:45,170
And we have only one woman.

344
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:50,709
What you're saying is not funny,
but it is true.

345
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:56,875
Two men having sex with one woman
is a cause for tragedy in our country.

346
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:01,489
How many idiots have ended up in jail,

347
01:26:01,556 --> 01:26:03,888
for killing a rival?

348
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,328
We are not rivals,

349
01:26:07,395 --> 01:26:10,558
we're friends who enjoy the same things.

350
01:26:10,632 --> 01:26:13,897
- You taught me to think that way.
- And you learned fast.

351
01:26:22,777 --> 01:26:24,745
You look so pretty.

352
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:55,858
First, I thought you didn't know
what you were doing.

353
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:58,398
The second day, I thought you were
a bit crazy.

354
01:38:58,465 --> 01:39:02,196
The third day, I had no doubt about it:
You're completely insane.

355
01:39:02,269 --> 01:39:05,932
Only you would dive into a spot
brimming with sharks.

356
01:39:06,006 --> 01:39:08,474
I'm only looking for one.

357
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:11,909
It's worse than trying to find a needle
in a haystack.

358
01:39:11,979 --> 01:39:16,075
Watch out, Blondie. Remember
the tiger shark won't spare you.

359
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:17,913
Suit yourself.

360
01:40:05,733 --> 01:40:07,166
What happened?

361
01:40:07,234 --> 01:40:09,134
- There are five of them.
- Five?

362
01:40:09,203 --> 01:40:11,967
There's a tiger shark. It's not
the one I'm looking for.

363
01:40:12,039 --> 01:40:15,372
But it is definitely alive.
Let's pull it out.

364
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:40,155
Stop it, Blondie! You'll destroy
the skin.

365
01:40:40,234 --> 01:40:42,202
Cut it out, Blondie.

366
01:41:41,261 --> 01:41:44,059
- Bring me a double vodka, on the rocks.
- Yes, sir.

367
01:42:01,648 --> 01:42:04,515
Disculpe, ¿hay alguna mesa libre?

368
01:43:07,915 --> 01:43:09,848
Two shrimp cocktails.

369
01:43:14,588 --> 01:43:16,920
Two cold beers, please.

370
01:43:40,647 --> 01:43:42,547
What about Kelly and Cynthia?

371
01:43:44,685 --> 01:43:47,176
If you're interested,

372
01:43:47,254 --> 01:43:50,781
I'll give them back to you tonight.
I'll trade them for these two.

373
01:49:51,318 --> 01:49:54,151
Get out! Get out of the water!

374
01:51:30,116 --> 01:51:32,414
It was horrible, Redhead.

375
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,015
Horrible.

376
01:51:36,089 --> 01:51:38,182
I can imagine.

377
01:51:39,225 --> 01:51:42,023
You can't imagine it.

378
01:51:42,095 --> 01:51:44,655
This goes beyond anything.

379
01:51:45,665 --> 01:51:48,429
And you tell me? I've battled
those beasts for years.

380
01:51:48,668 --> 01:51:51,438
And it's not just me.
It's the whole island.

381
01:51:51,473 --> 01:51:53,269
Here's the doctor.

382
01:51:54,274 --> 01:51:57,141
How do you feel? Did you sleep well?

383
01:51:57,210 --> 01:51:58,973
How's Kelly?

384
01:51:59,045 --> 01:52:02,742
She's still going through a nervous
breakdown. But she's better.

385
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:04,443
Can I see her?

386
01:52:07,187 --> 01:52:10,054
Now is not a good time.
She's still unconscious.

387
01:52:10,123 --> 01:52:13,752
Why don't you go and make your
statement at the port authority?

388
01:52:13,827 --> 01:52:16,796
You may come back in the afternoon
to see her.

389
01:52:18,298 --> 01:52:20,926
I can't come this afternoon, doctor.

390
01:52:23,136 --> 01:52:24,694
I have to go kill that animal.

391
01:52:29,342 --> 01:52:34,041
Why run the risk? If that tiger shark
is here, he'll get caught in the trap.

392
01:53:08,915 --> 01:53:11,349
She needs to react.

393
01:53:11,417 --> 01:53:16,116
It's important to let her know
that you've talked to her relatives.

394
01:53:16,189 --> 01:53:19,181
Her full and quick recovery
depends on that.

395
01:54:31,931 --> 01:54:35,264
Hello, Blondie.
I've got news for you.

396
01:54:42,542 --> 01:54:46,613
- What's this?
- A hook from my trap. He's a real beast.

397
01:54:46,648 --> 01:54:49,514
He's twenty feet long and he weighs
about one ton.

398
01:54:49,582 --> 01:54:53,109
I know that. But I never imagined
he was so strong.

399
01:54:53,186 --> 01:54:57,520
If that animal can bend my hooks,
how the hell will we kill him?

400
01:55:00,226 --> 01:55:04,356
- I can do it.
- Your bullets can get a bull or a lemon.

401
01:55:04,430 --> 01:55:08,059
But not a tiger shark. And least of all
this one that's pissed off.

402
01:55:09,369 --> 01:55:11,603
I only want one chance.

403
01:55:11,638 --> 01:55:15,096
You already got away once.
You won't do it the next.

404
01:58:33,569 --> 01:58:35,093
There you have it. It's a dogfish.

405
01:58:35,170 --> 01:58:37,104
It's over there. Look, look!

406
01:58:38,574 --> 01:58:41,407
That one's good for empanadas.

407
01:59:16,011 --> 01:59:18,605
- Hit him! Hit him hard.
- OK, man.

408
01:59:22,384 --> 01:59:23,612
Look out! Look out!

409
01:59:26,522 --> 01:59:28,353
Come up! The tiger shark's coming!

410
02:00:42,097 --> 02:00:44,657
This came yesterday in the last flight.

411
02:00:44,933 --> 02:00:47,731
A boat will come for you.
They're gathering all the fishermen.

412
02:00:49,738 --> 02:00:52,400
Did you hear what happened at the
beach today?

413
02:00:52,741 --> 02:00:56,507
Yes, the guy that came over told me.
What a tragedy.

414
02:00:56,745 --> 02:00:59,509
Do you think it is the same tiger shark?

415
02:00:59,748 --> 02:01:01,443
I'm absolutely sure.

416
02:01:02,951 --> 02:01:05,317
Well, I'm gonna go see what they want
me for.

417
02:01:06,755 --> 02:01:10,282
- Most probably to kill that animal.
- That will totally suck.

418
02:01:10,592 --> 02:01:13,493
- I'll be back in a little while.
- Good luck.

419
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:34,000
