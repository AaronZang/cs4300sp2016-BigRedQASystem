00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:56,221
* Whoo, hoo, hoo, hoo *

3
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,823
* Whoo, hoo, hoo, hoo *

4
00:00:58,824 --> 00:00:59,824
* Whoo, hoo, hoo, hoo *

5
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:02,060
* I wasn't feeling low *

6
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:04,295
* I wasn't feeling high *

7
00:01:04,296 --> 00:01:06,964
* Baby kept me up all night *

8
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:09,366
* He kept me up all night *

9
00:01:09,367 --> 00:01:12,036
* And I gotta get goin',
I gotta get goin' *

10
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:15,908
* I gotta get goin'
before the morning light *

11
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:24,115
* I wasn't up for games
of who's wrong or right *

12
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:26,851
* And baby, when you put
up a fight,

13
00:01:26,852 --> 00:01:29,187
you kept me up all night *

14
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:31,756
* And I gotta get goin',
I gotta get goin',

15
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:36,596
I gotta goin'
back onto my home *

16
00:01:38,596 --> 00:01:41,167
Damn.

17
00:01:43,402 --> 00:01:45,803
* Whoo, hoo, hoo, hoo *

18
00:01:45,804 --> 00:01:48,983
* Whoo, hoo, hoo, hoo *

19
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,863
* Whoo, hoo, hoo, hoo *

20
00:02:11,864 --> 00:02:13,666
* Whoo, hoo, hoo, hoo *

21
00:02:22,574 --> 00:02:24,108
Hey.

22
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:25,646
Hey.

23
00:02:28,646 --> 00:02:29,614
Ouch.

24
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:30,681
Yeah.

25
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:31,516
Yeah.

26
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:32,917
You know, I...

27
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:37,022
I left my car at the bar, so...

28
00:02:38,022 --> 00:02:38,824
Wow.

29
00:02:39,024 --> 00:02:40,391
Really?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:40,392 --> 00:02:43,093
Pretty sure I was in
no position to drive.

31
00:02:43,094 --> 00:02:44,596
Yeah, well, I'm...

32
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:47,097
a little fuzzy on
that part myself.

33
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:48,900
Yeah.

34
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:51,835
Okay, I'll...

35
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:53,437
I'll take ya back there.

36
00:02:53,438 --> 00:02:56,207
Or, you know,
I could just call a cab if...

37
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,109
That's okay.

38
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,616
I'll take ya back there.

39
00:03:04,616 --> 00:03:06,955
Thanks.

40
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:26,604
Kelly?

41
00:03:31,543 --> 00:03:33,450
Kimberly.

42
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,585
Ready?

43
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:44,222
Hun?

44
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:47,797
Well, this is not ideal.

45
00:04:14,186 --> 00:04:16,855
* Oh yeah *

46
00:04:18,857 --> 00:04:20,891
* Don't leave me hangin' *

47
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:22,826
* Like you don't care *

48
00:04:22,827 --> 00:04:26,865
* Last night was bangin',
but now, we're goin' nowhere *

49
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:41,612
* You think it's easy

50
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:43,448
to live in my skin *

51
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,083
* You wouldn't tease me
if you, if you knew

52
00:04:46,084 --> 00:04:47,920
where I've been *

53
00:04:52,057 --> 00:04:55,693
What do you think, man?

54
00:04:55,694 --> 00:04:56,893
Fuck!

55
00:04:56,894 --> 00:04:59,129
Cock suckin' motherfuckin'
bullshit!

56
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,097
Don't be that guy.

57
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:01,733
No, I'm gonna be that guy.

58
00:05:07,238 --> 00:05:10,340
* Gonna buy you a diamond ring *

59
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:15,278
* And if that honkin'
jerk don't stop *

60
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,814
* Mamma's gonna pop
a cap in his mother... *

61
00:05:17,815 --> 00:05:19,350
You know what, buddy?

62
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:22,886
I got a poopy diaper in here
and no wipes, all right?

63
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:24,523
Think I got it worse off.

64
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:39,504
Move!

65
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,106
I love you, honey,
but if you would sleep home

66
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:44,708
one night instead
of staying at his house,

67
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:53,917
you would be here
helping me instead of me...

68
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:55,285
I did.

69
00:05:55,286 --> 00:05:57,487
Okay, that sounds good.

70
00:05:57,488 --> 00:05:58,524
Tonight?

71
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,799
* Head, shoulders,
knees and toes *

72
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,400
Mom, he's on my side!

73
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:11,802
She's lying, I'm not touching.

74
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:12,804
I'm not touching!

75
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,104
Stop it!

76
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:15,840
You guys, cool down,
you two, cool it.

77
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:16,974
Do not make me come back there.

78
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:18,676
I didn't even do anything.

79
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:20,677
Okay, please, honey,
stop with the crying!

80
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:22,112
Stop picking on me!

81
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:23,414
You know what, if you guys can't
sit still for 20 minutes,

82
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:24,881
I'm turning the car around.

83
00:06:24,882 --> 00:06:25,817
That's what we're doing,
I'm turning around.

84
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:26,657
We're not going.

85
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:27,951
Yeah, right.

86
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:29,386
We're not even going anywhere.

87
00:06:29,387 --> 00:06:31,254
There's just millions
of cars in our way.

88
00:06:31,255 --> 00:06:32,925
You lost that one.

89
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:01,518
What the...

90
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,686
I need to...

91
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:03,453
Go ahead.

92
00:07:03,454 --> 00:07:04,770
No, what were you saying?

93
00:07:04,988 --> 00:07:07,725
I was just wonderin'
what the hell was goin' on here.

94
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:09,601
Torture.

95
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:17,368
What are you doing?

96
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:18,302
Gettin' comfortable.

97
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:19,270
You can't do that.

98
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:20,371
What if we start to move?

99
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:21,272
We're not goin' anywhere.

100
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:22,205
But what if we start to?

101
00:07:22,206 --> 00:07:22,740
Well, then I'll go!

102
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,576
I need to...

103
00:07:26,577 --> 00:07:28,746
I just really need
to not be here right now.

104
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:30,280
Yeah, well...

105
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:32,850
if you woulda snuck out
like any decent one night stand,

106
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:34,586
we wouldn't be, right?

107
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:43,393
I can feel you
staring, you know.

108
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:45,797
Sorry.

109
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:50,701
This is ridiculous.

110
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:53,175
Everyone's turning
off their engines.

111
00:07:58,175 --> 00:08:00,714
There better be a big
wreck up there.

112
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:04,314
What did you just say?

113
00:08:04,315 --> 00:08:05,616
What, if my time's being wasted,

114
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:09,587
I'd like it to be
for a good reason.

115
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:12,722
Oh, you are kinda dark.

116
00:08:12,723 --> 00:08:16,059
What, a little twisted
up metal never hurt anyone.

117
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,429
No, I'm actually pretty sure
that that is the exact

118
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,266
type of thing that hurts people.

119
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:24,135
It's just that there's
nothing worse than

120
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,537
when traffic lifts
for no reason.

121
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:28,205
Except for maybe, you know,
wishing somebody

122
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:29,607
getting in a car accident.

123
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:30,741
There's that.

124
00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:32,442
Is it so wrong
to want a little evidence

125
00:08:32,443 --> 00:08:34,278
to justify all this
as opposed to,

126
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,580
"Oh, you're just freed up",
and you don't even know why

127
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:38,181
you were stuck
in the first place.

128
00:08:38,182 --> 00:08:40,383
I'm sorry, but a giant fire
would make it

129
00:08:40,384 --> 00:08:42,753
at least worthwhile.

130
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:46,389
Okay.

131
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,062
There's gotta be
a science behind traffic, right?

132
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:52,729
Don't ya think?

133
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,499
No, I don't.

134
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,403
I do, a lot, actually.

135
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:01,305
You know, it's like,
none of that makes sense,

136
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:03,474
you know, like it kinda...

137
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:05,375
Kick off your shoes,
it's gonna be awhile,

138
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:07,077
and talk to your neighbor,
and please,

139
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:09,245
keep the road rage
to a minimum, folks.

140
00:09:09,246 --> 00:09:12,282
It's a fucking Sunday, people!

141
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:15,319
Heading north down to the south
bound 406 double lane road.

142
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,988
Both directions,
all the way up the highway

143
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,321
and down the interstate.

144
00:09:18,322 --> 00:09:20,124
Turns out, sorry,
there is no reason,

145
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,994
but, as soon as we hear...

146
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,696
It can't just be cause
of some guy who slams

147
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:27,831
on his brakes to stare
at some ducks,

148
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:30,267
or 'cause he spills
a Slurpee on himself.

149
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:31,828
There's gotta be
a mathematical equation

150
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,771
to all of this, right?

151
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:35,773
I think about guys
who get into the carpool lane,

152
00:09:35,774 --> 00:09:37,307
even though that's
going slower than

153
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:40,143
the normal traffic.

154
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:41,479
Makes no sense.

155
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,879
Oh, my God, there better
be a dead body up there,

156
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,949
because I just can't
take this anymore.

157
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,082
Now, somebody has to die?

158
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,652
Yeah, they do, thanks to you.

159
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:48,820
Why don't we just go
all the way and just say

160
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,821
somebody loses their head.

161
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:51,922
That'll be fun.

162
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:53,556
Put that out in the world.

163
00:09:53,557 --> 00:09:56,400
Somebody gets decapitated,
so it'll be worth your time.

164
00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:02,199
There's something
seriously wrong with you.

165
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,702
We have that in common.

166
00:10:05,703 --> 00:10:07,904
It's true.

167
00:10:07,905 --> 00:10:08,939
Totally true.

168
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,608
What's that?

169
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:12,188
Oh, you know, it's just easier

170
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,881
to have sex with a stranger
than converse with one.

171
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:19,282
What?

172
00:10:19,283 --> 00:10:21,051
You want me deep inside you?

173
00:10:21,052 --> 00:10:23,119
I want you inside me so deep.

174
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,354
Yeah?

175
00:10:24,355 --> 00:10:25,189
Oh.

176
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,257
Give it to me.

177
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,925
You give it to me.

178
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:29,793
Wait.

179
00:10:29,794 --> 00:10:31,362
Don't you want me
to give it to you?

180
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:33,196
Yeah, yeah,
just put it in already.

181
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:33,765
Okay, okay.

182
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:35,132
Okay.

183
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,934
You like that?

184
00:10:39,937 --> 00:10:41,705
You're screwing the blanket.

185
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:43,807
What?

186
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:44,808
Good try.

187
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:49,213
I can't feel anything
with this thing on.

188
00:10:49,214 --> 00:10:52,249
Okay, I told you
you couldn't get it in.

189
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,152
I guess that is what she said.

190
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:19,343
Well, I guess they don't
call it a one night stand

191
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:22,646
and the morning after
for a reason, right?

192
00:11:22,647 --> 00:11:24,515
What are you doing?

193
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:29,187
Fuck.

194
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:33,224
Do you need any help?

195
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,625
I'm fine.

196
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:37,894
I'm fine.

197
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:39,663
Oh, man, that's nasty.

198
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:43,868
What is she doing?

199
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,669
You let that all out, honey.

200
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:49,639
Fuckin' bullshit!

201
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,874
You disappoint me.

202
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,139
You're better than that.

203
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,859
If it's any consolation,
I have that affect

204
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,562
on all women.

205
00:12:12,563 --> 00:12:15,532
You don't have to try
to be charming or...

206
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:17,301
funny right now.

207
00:12:17,302 --> 00:12:19,910
I'm perfectly fine.

208
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:51,268
Are you sure I can't
do anything?

209
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:53,085
I'm fine!

210
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:09,052
Nothing came out by the way.

211
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:11,927
Just...

212
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:18,762
* I'm starting any day *

213
00:13:18,763 --> 00:13:20,298
* At last *

214
00:13:23,244 --> 00:13:25,034
* Baby, please, come with me *

215
00:13:25,035 --> 00:13:26,970
* I've had enough of fantasy *

216
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:29,038
* But maybe if I promise you *

217
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:31,242
* A promise is enough for you *

218
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,176
* I'll be back *

219
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:33,643
* I won't wait *

220
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:34,744
So...

221
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:36,113
what's the verdict?

222
00:13:36,114 --> 00:13:40,050
'Cause it looks like
we have quite the hung jury.

223
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:41,719
You are so sexy.

224
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,052
* I've had another fantasy *

225
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:44,687
* But maybe if I promise you *

226
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:47,291
* A promise is enough for you *

227
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:49,961
You've been naughty.

228
00:13:57,124 --> 00:13:58,335
* Another fantasy *

229
00:13:58,336 --> 00:14:00,170
* But maybe if I promise you *

230
00:14:00,171 --> 00:14:01,571
Want some of this?

231
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:02,773
Oh, yeah.

232
00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:03,907
Come here.

233
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:06,076
Come get me.

234
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:14,051
* Whoo hoo, whoo hoo,
whoo hoo, whoo hoo *

235
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:15,585
Come here.

236
00:14:15,586 --> 00:14:16,654
Yeah?

237
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:28,399
Don't leave any marks!

238
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:32,369
I'm serious!

239
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,840
All right, all right.

240
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:46,582
Oh, look what I found.

241
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,583
Ding-ding.

242
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:49,085
Sexy time!

243
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:50,521
Just put it in me.

244
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,756
Okay.

245
00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:58,061
You want me to fuck you?

246
00:14:58,062 --> 00:15:00,565
No, I want you to do my taxes.

247
00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:08,973
What?

248
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,075
You want me deep inside you?

249
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,909
I want you inside me so deep.

250
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,077
Yeah?

251
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:15,178
Oh.

252
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:16,312
Give it to me.

253
00:15:16,313 --> 00:15:19,583
You give it to me.

254
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:25,955
So, you're a florist, right?

255
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:27,758
Attorney.

256
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,093
Right.

257
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,798
It's a shame,
I really like flowers.

258
00:15:33,798 --> 00:15:36,800
To think I could be
sitting in a cab right now.

259
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:38,134
You're such a nice guy.

260
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:39,135
Wow.

261
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:40,537
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:40,538 --> 00:15:42,272
No, I'm... I'm just
impressed that you

263
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:44,374
remembered my name.

264
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,877
You were more
sober than I thought.

265
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:48,077
Was I?

266
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:49,812
Yeah, 'cause...

267
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:52,018
oh, you just meant, guy,
like I'm a guy.

268
00:15:52,727 --> 00:15:53,938
No, 'cause that's my...

269
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:54,984
Right, Guy!

270
00:15:54,985 --> 00:15:55,619
Yeah.

271
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,286
Guy.

272
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:59,089
See how that worked?

273
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,758
Well, I guess I just
got lucky with that one.

274
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,130
It happens.

275
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,464
It's a pleasure to meet you.

276
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:09,066
Oh.

277
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:10,834
Sara.

278
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:12,036
Sara.

279
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,670
Sara.

280
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:16,340
Oh.

281
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:20,476
So, what kind of
an attorney are you, Sara?

282
00:16:20,477 --> 00:16:23,547
I do international,
commercial arbitration.

283
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:24,715
Oh, cool.

284
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:27,417
What jurisdiction?

285
00:16:27,418 --> 00:16:28,819
You have no idea what I do.

286
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,853
Nope, not in the slightest.

287
00:16:29,854 --> 00:16:32,056
No.

288
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,389
I deal with dispute
resolution over

289
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,793
international sale of goods.

290
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:38,162
I'm an accountant.

291
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,497
I do people's taxes.

292
00:16:40,498 --> 00:16:42,066
Well, that's easier.

293
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,200
Yeah.

294
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:44,201
To explain.

295
00:16:44,202 --> 00:16:46,873
Sure, I know what you meant.

296
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:52,142
I think I hired a lawyer
for a traffic ticket one time.

297
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:53,777
Oh yeah, how'd that
work out for ya?

298
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:56,913
It was like 140 bucks
for a 10 minute phone call.

299
00:16:56,914 --> 00:16:57,748
Really?
- Yeah.

300
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:59,082
You got off cheap.

301
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,284
It was dismissed before
you could even do anything.

302
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:03,686
I woulda charged you double.

303
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:05,255
Really?

304
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:07,056
Just when I was likin' ya.

305
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:08,725
Tell me you're being sarcastic.

306
00:17:08,726 --> 00:17:09,826
What can I say.

307
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:12,695
You can take the girl
out of Brooklyn, but...

308
00:17:12,696 --> 00:17:13,765
Brooklyn?

309
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:15,699
I like Brooklyn.

310
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,133
I think I have
some family up there.

311
00:17:17,134 --> 00:17:18,936
Yeah, everybody does.

312
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,276
I can't get it in.

313
00:17:26,277 --> 00:17:27,678
That's what she said.

314
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,364
Oh my God, really,
with that one?

315
00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:31,181
Whoops!

316
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:33,049
You're leanin' on my doorbell.

317
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,050
Wow.

318
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:37,187
Look at that.

319
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:41,057
The city is gorgeous!

320
00:17:41,058 --> 00:17:42,992
Oh my gosh.

321
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:45,962
I love the sound of ambulances.

322
00:17:45,963 --> 00:17:48,297
It's so soothing.

323
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:52,069
Reminds me of home.

324
00:17:54,071 --> 00:17:57,607
Give me a tour.

325
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:59,942
This is it.

326
00:17:59,943 --> 00:18:02,546
Oh, my God.

327
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:05,249
Really?

328
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,755
Well, give it a whirl
before ya judge.

329
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:11,822
Oh.

330
00:18:11,823 --> 00:18:13,356
That's real money in there.

331
00:18:13,357 --> 00:18:17,193
Okay, this is awesome.

332
00:18:17,194 --> 00:18:19,563
Ooh, you play?

333
00:18:19,564 --> 00:18:21,698
Oh, yeah.

334
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:24,934
Oh, oh...

335
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:26,569
it's loud.

336
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,604
Oh, sorry.

337
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:30,574
And the neighbors.

338
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:32,644
Oh.

339
00:18:36,346 --> 00:18:39,092
That is some hot ass music.

340
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:50,028
Look at that.

341
00:18:51,028 --> 00:18:53,764
Where was this taken?

342
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,499
That.

343
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,670
That...

344
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,006
I don't know.

345
00:19:02,006 --> 00:19:03,105
You don't know?

346
00:19:03,106 --> 00:19:04,775
I don't know, I have no idea.

347
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:09,947
But, I prefer it that way,
you know, 'cause then it's mine,

348
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,782
wherever I want it to be.

349
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:20,923
Yeah, but I would
still wanna know, you know?

350
00:19:20,924 --> 00:19:22,925
It's in your home.

351
00:19:22,926 --> 00:19:23,893
Right.

352
00:19:23,894 --> 00:19:25,996
Ooh, old school, I love it.

353
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:26,997
Can I play it low?

354
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:28,364
Yeah.

355
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:29,865
But you have to play
it really low, please.

356
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:31,546
Okay.

357
00:19:47,384 --> 00:19:51,721
Oh, oh, listen to that crackle.

358
00:19:51,722 --> 00:19:56,425
Oh, you just don't get that
on nineteens, you know?

359
00:19:56,426 --> 00:19:59,695
Well, glad you appreciate it.

360
00:19:59,696 --> 00:20:02,132
Totally.

361
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:03,200
How can you not, though?

362
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:07,104
It's just so damn...

363
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,373
sexy.

364
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:15,645
Look at this place.

365
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:17,848
You've done pretty
good for yourself?

366
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:27,923
This is like
the softest carpet ever!

367
00:20:27,924 --> 00:20:29,028
This is amazing.

368
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:33,396
Ooh.

369
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:35,531
Oh, I love this carpet.

370
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:38,868
I just wanna have sex with it.

371
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:42,271
Where'd you say
you were from again?

372
00:20:42,272 --> 00:20:45,342
Don't you think that
we're way passed that

373
00:20:45,343 --> 00:20:48,812
get to know you chit chat
phase, Greg?

374
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:50,681
It's Guy.

375
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,615
Still.

376
00:20:52,616 --> 00:20:55,919
You know, we just never
got around to any of that.

377
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,387
There's just one,
teensy-weensy little thing

378
00:20:58,388 --> 00:21:00,723
you need to know about me.

379
00:21:00,724 --> 00:21:02,558
What's that?

380
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,195
Are you gonna take me like this,

381
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:09,766
or like this?

382
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:10,801
Oh.

383
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,740
I'm gonna...

384
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:19,375
I'm gonna...

385
00:21:19,376 --> 00:21:21,448
make us some drinks.

386
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,315
Well, that works, too.

387
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:31,054
I think I have vodka,
a little bit of tequila.

388
00:21:31,055 --> 00:21:33,422
So...

389
00:21:33,423 --> 00:21:38,327
how many ladies have you had out
on that balcony?

390
00:21:38,328 --> 00:21:41,631
That is none of your business.

391
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:42,900
Zero.

392
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:47,738
Okay.

393
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,105
We're gonna do vodka.

394
00:21:49,106 --> 00:21:50,574
Just bring out the bottle.

395
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,209
I don't need a fancy drink

396
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,145
with a twist in it
or anything like that.

397
00:21:56,146 --> 00:21:58,815
So, I have...

398
00:21:58,816 --> 00:22:01,284
cranberry and cranberry.

399
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:03,620
I'm taking this carpet
home with me.

400
00:22:03,621 --> 00:22:04,621
Right, okay.

401
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:07,056
I will, too.

402
00:22:07,057 --> 00:22:08,458
You have really good taste.

403
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:09,526
It's really neat in here.

404
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:10,861
Are you sure you're not gay?

405
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:14,432
You are makin' this
very hard on me.

406
00:22:42,226 --> 00:22:43,125
I just...

407
00:22:43,126 --> 00:22:43,926
I need to use the...

408
00:22:43,994 --> 00:22:44,994
Me first.

409
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:36,313
* Baby, I just
got your message *

410
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,315
* I heard you're
feelin' restless *

411
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,249
* Needing new adventures *

412
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,285
* A more uncertain future *

413
00:23:42,286 --> 00:23:44,220
* This time count me out *

414
00:23:44,221 --> 00:23:50,428
* I'm better off without
your doubts for now *

415
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:55,397
Hey.

416
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:58,735
Hey.

417
00:23:58,736 --> 00:24:01,403
You come here often?

418
00:24:01,404 --> 00:24:04,474
Well, I guess that depends
on you, doesn't it?

419
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,917
* Somewhere, something,
someone *

420
00:24:16,443 --> 00:24:18,654
So, have you decided how
you're gonna close

421
00:24:18,655 --> 00:24:19,757
this deal yet?

422
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:24,060
Jury's still out on that.

423
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:31,367
Oh, well, may I approach?

424
00:24:31,368 --> 00:24:32,969
You may.

425
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,904
Okay.

426
00:24:34,905 --> 00:24:38,544
What did you have in mind?

427
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:40,143
I just...

428
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:42,679
oh.

429
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,916
You are out of order,
young lady.

430
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:48,419
Okay.

431
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:53,390
Still deliberating, I see.

432
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:56,358
Yeah, this may take awhile.

433
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:59,829
* Oh, promises are not for you *

434
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:04,202
Work that thing
like it's goin' out of style.

435
00:25:06,202 --> 00:25:08,807
Not a compliment.

436
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:15,012
The long-term effect
of texting can not be positive.

437
00:25:16,012 --> 00:25:17,980
What?

438
00:25:17,981 --> 00:25:19,348
Nothin'.

439
00:25:19,349 --> 00:25:20,650
Oh, I know, right?

440
00:25:20,651 --> 00:25:22,085
It's so annoying,
people being able

441
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:23,953
to get in contact with you 24/7.

442
00:25:23,954 --> 00:25:26,922
Yeah, if I had mine,
we could text each other.

443
00:25:26,923 --> 00:25:27,824
That'd be fun.

444
00:25:27,825 --> 00:25:29,695
Yeah, that must suck.

445
00:25:31,525 --> 00:25:33,262
Went on a date once
with this girl

446
00:25:33,263 --> 00:25:35,297
that texted the entire time.

447
00:25:35,298 --> 00:25:36,932
It was so annoying.

448
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:38,035
Rude.

449
00:25:41,672 --> 00:25:45,107
Okay, I'm gonna go find out
what the hell's goin' on.

450
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:46,911
All right, let me know.

451
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,522
* I will not play
by your rules *

452
00:26:00,523 --> 00:26:02,057
* You know, I've heard
them before *

453
00:26:02,058 --> 00:26:03,258
* I'm not a kid, I'm not a fool,

454
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:06,229
I'm walkin' out that door *

455
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,998
* Can you feel it *

456
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,266
* Yeah, baby, can you feel
me comin' like a whirlwind *

457
00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:11,334
* Mind and body open *

458
00:26:11,335 --> 00:26:12,935
* Gonna jack it up, yo *

459
00:26:12,936 --> 00:26:14,738
* Through the top,
'cause I can't stop *

460
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,405
* Gonna take you
where you ain't never been *

461
00:26:16,406 --> 00:26:18,173
* Through to sin *

462
00:26:18,174 --> 00:26:20,876
* Yeah, baby, can you feel
me comin' like a whirlwind *

463
00:26:20,877 --> 00:26:22,178
* Mind and body open *

464
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:24,952
* Gonna jack it up, yo,
to the top *

465
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:39,496
So, I got a bit of bad news.

466
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,765
Unfortunately,
I didn't see any sign

467
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,098
of a car wreck.

468
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:45,501
But, that's not to say
that further down the line

469
00:26:45,502 --> 00:26:48,505
there's not like
mass carnage everywhere.

470
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,739
Oh, well I'll keep
my fingers crossed.

471
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,075
Oh, I ran into
a couple cops, also stuck,

472
00:26:53,076 --> 00:26:56,179
that politely told me
to stay the hell in my car.

473
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,786
So, status quo then.

474
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,820
It appears so.

475
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:08,124
Another vibrating device
that men have to compete with.

476
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:11,260
How fun.

477
00:27:11,261 --> 00:27:13,314
Just so you know,
I wrote the letter "U"

478
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:17,100
as opposed to the word
"y-o-u" in a brief recently,

479
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:19,235
so that would be
the effect of texting.

480
00:27:19,236 --> 00:27:21,438
Total butchering
of the English language.

481
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:22,971
O- M-G!

482
00:27:22,972 --> 00:27:26,976
Thank God for spell check.

483
00:27:26,977 --> 00:27:28,278
You're quick.

484
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,312
When I have to be.

485
00:27:29,313 --> 00:27:30,713
Why, is that surprising?

486
00:27:30,714 --> 00:27:33,516
Under this circumstance,
yeah, it's not typical.

487
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:36,452
What, only stupid girls
are allowed to go home

488
00:27:36,453 --> 00:27:37,854
with some random dude?

489
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:40,723
Just me, usually, I mean...

490
00:27:40,724 --> 00:27:42,525
I wouldn't judge
a girl's intellect

491
00:27:42,526 --> 00:27:44,861
based on her life choices
while under the influence

492
00:27:44,862 --> 00:27:45,961
of a margarita.

493
00:27:45,962 --> 00:27:48,397
Whose margarita?

494
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:49,504
Yeah, that was great.

495
00:27:49,787 --> 00:27:51,735
You know what,
you go ahead and judge.

496
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:52,902
All right.

497
00:27:52,903 --> 00:27:53,937
Are you serious?

498
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:56,338
Texting, this fucking texting!

499
00:27:56,339 --> 00:27:57,806
It's ruining the world.

500
00:27:57,807 --> 00:27:59,476
Honestly, who the hell
needs to get a hold of you

501
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:02,412
at eight A.M.
on a Sunday morning?

502
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:04,015
Nobody.

503
00:28:05,015 --> 00:28:08,819
Somebody, boyfriend maybe?

504
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,488
Well, I hope he's not
the jealous type

505
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:15,557
because I am a lover,
not a fighter.

506
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:16,726
Yup.

507
00:28:16,727 --> 00:28:18,627
You know, I'm really not
the type to impede

508
00:28:18,628 --> 00:28:20,997
on somebody else's happiness,
so I think that we should

509
00:28:20,998 --> 00:28:23,098
probably just end this
right now.

510
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:24,500
Oh, well, I understand.

511
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:27,036
Don't be so broken up about it.

512
00:28:27,037 --> 00:28:30,105
I'm not.

513
00:28:30,106 --> 00:28:32,741
Well, it makes sense though.

514
00:28:32,742 --> 00:28:36,179
You don't really seem like the
single type, not sober, anyway.

515
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,081
What single type?

516
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:39,848
There's a type, you know?

517
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:42,751
You know, there's a certain
charm, there's a certain spark.

518
00:28:42,752 --> 00:28:45,154
That I'm lacking.
- There's a spark.

519
00:28:45,155 --> 00:28:47,289
Constantly looking,
zigzagging around.

520
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,225
Interested in other people.

521
00:28:49,226 --> 00:28:50,794
What, you don't have
any married friends?

522
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:53,062
All my friends are married!
- Oh, okay.

523
00:28:53,063 --> 00:28:54,764
Well, you should ask them.

524
00:28:54,765 --> 00:28:56,799
I mean, that's why I'm invited
to all their parties,

525
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,835
so they can watch all
the flirtiness go down

526
00:28:58,836 --> 00:29:01,504
and not be bored.

527
00:29:01,505 --> 00:29:03,539
That's messed up.
- Right?

528
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,108
Think about that the next time
you and your boyfriend

529
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:09,882
have people over.

530
00:29:11,882 --> 00:29:15,418
So, what's his deal?

531
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,720
Is he a lawyer, too?

532
00:29:17,721 --> 00:29:20,890
He's 6'3", all muscle,
black belt in taekwondo.

533
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:22,558
Don't worry, I think that he
finally understands

534
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,865
that we're seeing other people.

535
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:31,300
My vote is that you take me
home with you.

536
00:29:31,301 --> 00:29:34,170
Oh, is that right?

537
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:36,406
And do dirty things to me.

538
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:43,547
Somebody agrees with me.

539
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:51,921
Well, that somebody doesn't
always make the best decisions.

540
00:29:51,922 --> 00:29:54,524
Seems pretty smart to me.

541
00:29:54,525 --> 00:29:56,793
Oh, God.

542
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:58,161
You are bad.

543
00:29:58,162 --> 00:30:01,698
Really?
- Yeah, yeah, you are bad.

544
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:06,501
I know it when I see it
and you are bad.

545
00:30:06,502 --> 00:30:08,008
Good.

546
00:30:11,008 --> 00:30:14,576
Oh, you're gonna make me
do things I shouldn't.

547
00:30:14,577 --> 00:30:19,515
And I'll make you do things
that you thought you couldn't.

548
00:30:19,516 --> 00:30:21,517
Wait, you're not gonna
take me home

549
00:30:21,518 --> 00:30:23,353
and chop me into little pieces,
are you,

550
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,776
'cause I'm not really in
to that kind of thing?

551
00:30:26,022 --> 00:30:28,391
You're not?

552
00:30:28,392 --> 00:30:31,928
Okay, I think you're sexy...

553
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:33,863
...relatively.

554
00:30:33,864 --> 00:30:35,431
Oh, wow.

555
00:30:35,432 --> 00:30:38,066
You just got me a little wet.

556
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:41,437
Oh, my god.
- Excuse me, sir?

557
00:30:41,438 --> 00:30:43,944
Sir?

558
00:30:47,944 --> 00:30:49,913
I don't know about this.

559
00:30:54,117 --> 00:30:55,318
Hey?

560
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,537
Your boyfriend's calling.

561
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:16,204
It's not my boyfriend.

562
00:31:16,205 --> 00:31:18,807
Oh, does he know that?
- Oh, my god.

563
00:31:18,808 --> 00:31:20,442
Can you do something
to get us moving?

564
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:22,077
I mean, really.
- And what would you suggest?

565
00:31:22,078 --> 00:31:23,947
I don't know, it's just...

566
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,415
What, is the President
in town or something?

567
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:28,183
You know, it may not be
my place to say,

568
00:31:28,184 --> 00:31:30,752
but what's up with this guy,
gettin' you all freaked out?

569
00:31:30,753 --> 00:31:33,556
It's not a guy,
it's my crazy sisters, okay?

570
00:31:33,557 --> 00:31:35,525
We were supposed to meet up
and whenever we have a plan,

571
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:38,227
my whole world
has to revolve around it.

572
00:31:38,228 --> 00:31:40,162
I just thought we'd be
out of here by now,

573
00:31:40,163 --> 00:31:42,765
so I don't know what to type.

574
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:45,034
Why don't you try
typing the truth?

575
00:31:45,035 --> 00:31:49,505
What, "Hey guys, I had sex with
some random stranger last night

576
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:51,441
and I won't be able to make
our morning brunch after all

577
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:53,375
'cause I'll be stuck
in the drive of shame

578
00:31:53,376 --> 00:31:57,246
and forced to make chit-chat
for God knows how much longer."

579
00:31:57,247 --> 00:31:58,914
So, is that what
you want me to write?

580
00:31:58,915 --> 00:32:00,549
That sounds about right.

581
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,353
My phone would explode, we don't
have that kind of relationship.

582
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:06,722
Really, I tell
my dad everything?

583
00:32:06,723 --> 00:32:08,357
He's gonna get a kick
out of this shit.

584
00:32:08,358 --> 00:32:10,226
I'm so glad my nightmare
makes for a good story.

585
00:32:10,227 --> 00:32:12,060
Oh, now, don't take all
the credit.

586
00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:13,895
It's my nightmare, too.

587
00:32:13,896 --> 00:32:17,566
I'll just tell them
I'm not feeling well.

588
00:32:17,567 --> 00:32:20,502
Oh, my god, I have to get
the hell out of here!

589
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:24,039
Wow, you know, I'm getting
a really, like, over bearing,

590
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,174
clingy vibe from you right now.

591
00:32:26,175 --> 00:32:28,044
You are so not funny.
- It's cool.

592
00:32:28,045 --> 00:32:30,712
I've never actually really
had a stalker, this is fun.

593
00:32:30,713 --> 00:32:33,583
If it wasn't five miles
in heels, I would be walking.

594
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:36,552
I'm all for the women
empowerment thing, right,

595
00:32:36,553 --> 00:32:38,954
but don't let the after sex
cuddle chemicals

596
00:32:38,955 --> 00:32:40,856
go to your head.

597
00:32:40,857 --> 00:32:44,326
You'd have to make me orgasm
to release oxytocin,

598
00:32:44,327 --> 00:32:46,362
so don't worry,
you're in the clear, buddy.

599
00:32:46,363 --> 00:32:50,165
Ouch, wow, you are ruthless.

600
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:52,101
I bet you're really good
at what you do.

601
00:32:52,102 --> 00:32:53,736
When I have to be.

602
00:32:53,737 --> 00:32:56,572
Why don't we just listen
to some music?

603
00:32:56,573 --> 00:32:59,441
To the 808 show on KSOC...
- Can you just...

604
00:32:59,442 --> 00:33:01,743
Okay, I'm just...
I'm getting there.

605
00:33:01,744 --> 00:33:04,814
Give me three seconds to get out
of talk radio.

606
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:06,816
Well now, it's just skipping,
it's skipping.

607
00:33:06,817 --> 00:33:08,918
You have to stop
pressing the button.

608
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:10,385
It's static, you like that?

609
00:33:10,386 --> 00:33:12,722
You wanna listen to some static
for a while?

610
00:33:16,192 --> 00:33:17,593
Just change it, okay?

611
00:33:17,594 --> 00:33:19,394
All right, I'll change it,
there we go.

612
00:33:19,395 --> 00:33:21,096
There we go, more talk radio.

613
00:33:21,097 --> 00:33:23,132
Well, stop pushing the button.

614
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:24,700
You passed a good song.

615
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:26,969
Stop pressing the button
and then it won't stop...

616
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,239
I have stopped pressing
the button.

617
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,742
And in the joy
of a new beginning.

618
00:33:36,747 --> 00:33:39,848
Come on, man.
- There's traffic on the highway.

619
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:42,050
No news on what's causing this
jam, but as soon as we know,

620
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:44,086
you will, too,
so get comfortable.

621
00:33:44,087 --> 00:33:47,656
You like that, we'll listen
to this for a while?

622
00:33:47,657 --> 00:33:51,193
Don't, I know how to use it,
this is my car.

623
00:33:51,194 --> 00:33:53,265
I'm trying to get back to that...

624
00:33:55,265 --> 00:34:01,574
That concludes our music.

625
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:10,312
You know, I just wanted
to cut loose, just one night,

626
00:34:10,313 --> 00:34:12,982
just for once in my life,
you know?

627
00:34:12,983 --> 00:34:16,118
One night with no expectations.

628
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:18,788
This is what I get.

629
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:22,424
Sorry.

630
00:34:22,425 --> 00:34:26,463
Well, at least I know why
I never did this before.

631
00:34:28,465 --> 00:34:30,066
What?

632
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:31,734
Come on.

633
00:34:31,735 --> 00:34:33,736
Every girl says that.

634
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:37,073
Oh, I've never done this before,
this so isn't me.

635
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:40,308
Honestly, that's the oldest
cliché in the book

636
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:44,680
and frankly, I expected
more out of you.

637
00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:46,915
Well, maybe the really smart
girls that you're used

638
00:34:46,916 --> 00:34:49,718
to taking home say things
just to get a reaction

639
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:52,555
or some false sense
of non-slutiness,

640
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:54,689
but I say what I mean
and I stick to the facts.

641
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,459
It makes for a cleaner argument.

642
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,761
Well, first of all, this is
my Honda, not a courtroom,

643
00:34:58,762 --> 00:35:01,296
second, I'm not arguing,
I'm just disagreeing.

644
00:35:01,297 --> 00:35:04,600
You can't disagree with facts,
that's what makes them facts.

645
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:06,502
Otherwise, they'd be opinions.

646
00:35:06,503 --> 00:35:09,272
No, they're your facts
and since you're saying them,

647
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,906
that makes them your opinion.

648
00:35:10,907 --> 00:35:11,908
That doesn't make sense.

649
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:13,142
Yeah, it makes total sense.

650
00:35:13,143 --> 00:35:14,643
I'll explain it to you.
- Please do.

651
00:35:14,644 --> 00:35:17,346
Okay, good,
since you're confused?

652
00:35:17,347 --> 00:35:19,915
I'm not confused,
your logic isn't logical.

653
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:21,651
Illogical.
- Okay, whatever.

654
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,953
You sure you're not
confused here?

655
00:35:23,954 --> 00:35:25,654
I am a little bit, actually,

656
00:35:25,655 --> 00:35:27,556
but only because
you're not making any sense

657
00:35:27,557 --> 00:35:30,426
and not because I can't grasp
your attempt to be esoteric,

658
00:35:30,427 --> 00:35:31,761
but really idiotic point.

659
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,428
Wow, is that what you do
in the courtroom,

660
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:35,198
just call the defense names?

661
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,634
No, I prove your illogic
via an analogy, okay?

662
00:35:38,635 --> 00:35:40,403
But I thought I'd water it down
for the layman.

663
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,837
Oh, there you go again,
calling the defense names.

664
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:44,806
I'm a commercial
arbitrator, okay?

665
00:35:44,807 --> 00:35:47,709
There's no defense because
there's no fucking courtroom.

666
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,678
I don't think
I appreciate your tone.

667
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:51,881
Five minutes of silence!

668
00:35:51,882 --> 00:35:55,917
What, did you just give me
a time out?

669
00:35:55,918 --> 00:35:59,221
I think that we should just have
five minutes to just regroup,

670
00:35:59,222 --> 00:36:00,989
for both of us, okay?

671
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,526
No talking.

672
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:10,032
Okay, we were sort of in the
middle of that, but whatever.

673
00:36:29,885 --> 00:36:32,187
This is kind of silence.

674
00:36:32,188 --> 00:36:33,824
Sorry.

675
00:36:41,231 --> 00:36:45,034
Be a little bit more selective,
then maybe you...

676
00:36:47,009 --> 00:36:49,904
* I'm alone in this world,
my only friend is a BIC *

677
00:36:49,905 --> 00:36:52,774
* And opportunity was knocking
at the end of my wrist *

678
00:36:52,775 --> 00:36:56,111
* Defended by my words,
I rock my tongue on my sleeve *

679
00:36:56,112 --> 00:36:58,147
* But I made some bad choices *

680
00:36:58,148 --> 00:37:02,085
Oh, my god, I gotta pee,
I gotta pee.

681
00:37:15,965 --> 00:37:18,933
It's okay.

682
00:37:18,934 --> 00:37:19,934
It's okay.

683
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:42,957
I think we should just
agree to disagree, okay?

684
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:46,629
I hear you and I disagree.

685
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,297
And I agree, okay.

686
00:37:49,298 --> 00:37:54,169
No, I disagree with agreeing
to disagree.

687
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,604
You don't wanna agree
to disagree?

688
00:37:55,605 --> 00:37:58,107
No, I disagree with you
and I disagree

689
00:37:58,108 --> 00:38:01,810
with agreeing to disagree
'cause I don't agree.

690
00:38:01,811 --> 00:38:04,647
Disagreeing is not something
that we should agree on.

691
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:06,649
That just means that we
can't come to an agreement.

692
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,417
Well, I don't agree,
I think that you and I

693
00:38:08,418 --> 00:38:11,354
can come to an agreement,
so I disagree with agreeing

694
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,455
to the idea that we can't
come to an agreement,

695
00:38:13,456 --> 00:38:16,195
so all around, I disagree.

696
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:25,567
Well, you argue almost as well
as you dance.

697
00:38:25,568 --> 00:38:26,334
* Make it *

698
00:38:26,335 --> 00:38:27,236
* Taste it *

699
00:38:27,237 --> 00:38:28,104
* Touch it *

700
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:29,238
* Groove it *

701
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,071
* Move it *

702
00:38:30,072 --> 00:38:31,040
* Prove it *

703
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:31,742
* Hit it *

704
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:32,975
* Tap it *

705
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:34,042
* Oh *

706
00:38:34,043 --> 00:38:34,711
* Gimme some *

707
00:38:34,911 --> 00:38:35,845
* Gimme some *

708
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:36,779
* Gimme some *

709
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,680
* Gimme some *

710
00:38:38,681 --> 00:38:42,384
* I want it *

711
00:38:42,385 --> 00:38:44,120
* Come and get it *

712
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:47,023
* I want it *

713
00:38:48,023 --> 00:38:49,023
* Gimme some *

714
00:38:52,161 --> 00:38:54,497
* You make me wanna *

715
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,964
* Make me wanna rub it good *

716
00:38:55,965 --> 00:38:57,732
* I ain't tryin'
to fall in love *

717
00:38:57,733 --> 00:39:00,403
* I just wanna- *

718
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,738
- * I want it *
- * Come and get it *

719
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:04,007
* I want it *

720
00:39:05,007 --> 00:39:06,741
* Come and get it *

721
00:39:06,742 --> 00:39:09,818
* Gimme some *

722
00:39:14,818 --> 00:39:18,254
So, why me?

723
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,522
I mean, you say
you don't do this,

724
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,424
so why's you come home with me?

725
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,259
You Travolta'ed your way
into my pants.

726
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,127
Oh, come on, I've danced
with a lot of girls.

727
00:39:25,128 --> 00:39:26,895
They don't just drop skirt.

728
00:39:26,896 --> 00:39:30,131
I had to put forth half
of the effort that I usually do.

729
00:39:30,132 --> 00:39:31,567
Usually?
- Yeah.

730
00:39:31,568 --> 00:39:33,569
How many times
constitutes usually?

731
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:36,071
It's not like I'm some
player or something,

732
00:39:36,072 --> 00:39:41,676
but I tend to have the type
of relationship that lasts,

733
00:39:41,677 --> 00:39:44,513
like, one night.

734
00:39:44,514 --> 00:39:46,348
Where are you going with this
because it kind of sounds

735
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:47,750
like you're calling me easy?

736
00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:49,618
No, that's not exactly...
- Pretty much.

737
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:51,386
Okay, fine, that's exactly
what I'm saying,

738
00:39:51,387 --> 00:39:53,055
but because I don't think
that that's you.

739
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:55,790
Otherwise, this wouldn't be
so awkward, right?

740
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:58,194
It would've just been, like,
"Whatever, no big deal."

741
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:00,995
You would know.
- Yeah, wait, no.

742
00:40:00,996 --> 00:40:02,564
You don't know me.

743
00:40:02,565 --> 00:40:05,468
No, I don't, but thanks
for reminding me of that.

744
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:07,736
Look, usually, I'd have
showered you off by now

745
00:40:07,737 --> 00:40:09,038
and gone about my day.

746
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,305
Ew.

747
00:40:10,306 --> 00:40:12,508
So, let's consider this
a moment in time

748
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:14,743
that should've never
happened, right?

749
00:40:14,744 --> 00:40:17,046
Whether it's the president's
motorcade

750
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:19,147
or some, like,
fiery car accident

751
00:40:19,148 --> 00:40:21,116
where people are getting
decapitated all over.

752
00:40:21,117 --> 00:40:23,118
That was you, okay?

753
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,087
The point is we shouldn't
probably be here right now

754
00:40:26,088 --> 00:40:28,556
and because we'll most likely
do our separate ways

755
00:40:28,557 --> 00:40:31,993
and never see each other again,
I say we take full advantage

756
00:40:31,994 --> 00:40:33,828
of this opportunity.

757
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:35,363
Take advantage?

758
00:40:35,364 --> 00:40:37,366
Are you being creepy right now,
don't be creepy?

759
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:39,634
No, I'm not, I'm saying
that there's no reason

760
00:40:39,635 --> 00:40:42,037
not to be dead honest
with each other

761
00:40:42,038 --> 00:40:45,274
and the only girls that I know
that go to bars alone

762
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:48,944
are, frankly, alcoholics
or cougars.

763
00:40:48,945 --> 00:40:50,479
Wow, you keep good company.

764
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,381
Which is why it doesn't add up.

765
00:40:52,382 --> 00:40:55,084
So, either you're lying
and you do like me

766
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:58,988
and care about what I think...

767
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,355
Or?

768
00:41:00,356 --> 00:41:05,528
Or I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

769
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:07,763
Don't you mean the right place
at the right time?

770
00:41:07,764 --> 00:41:11,200
No, not with someone who says
they don't do this, Sarah.

771
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:14,706
That's what doesn't add up.

772
00:41:16,706 --> 00:41:18,741
What?

773
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:20,743
It's Holly.

774
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,947
What's Holly?

775
00:41:24,947 --> 00:41:27,018
My name, if we're being honest.

776
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:31,757
If we're not, then it's Sarah.

777
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:36,759
Wow.

778
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,463
What about Kim,
you sure it's not Kim?

779
00:41:41,463 --> 00:41:44,933
That'd be pretty funny
after all this, but no.

780
00:41:44,934 --> 00:41:48,504
That's so unnecessary, like I'm
gonna stalk you or something.

781
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:51,506
No, I just thought
it would be...

782
00:41:51,507 --> 00:41:54,243
I thought it'd be easier
to be someone else, you know?

783
00:41:54,244 --> 00:41:59,853
For you maybe.
- Yeah, for me.

784
00:42:03,853 --> 00:42:09,223
Well, I'm still Guy
if it matters.

785
00:42:09,224 --> 00:42:12,493
I know you are.

786
00:42:12,494 --> 00:42:15,497
Dead honest, right?
- Sure.

787
00:42:15,498 --> 00:42:20,069
Okay, why did you come back
in this morning?

788
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:25,107
What, so you wouldn't
make me feel like I was cheap?

789
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:28,746
I left my cell phone.

790
00:42:30,746 --> 00:42:33,115
Well, now I feel cheap.

791
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:54,636
That, my friend,
is a purple nurple.

792
00:42:54,637 --> 00:42:56,437
That'll get you through
any old kind of day.

793
00:42:56,438 --> 00:43:00,142
Oh, that is awful.

794
00:43:00,143 --> 00:43:02,210
Put hair on your chest there?

795
00:43:02,211 --> 00:43:07,448
Hey, don't look
at my purple nurples.

796
00:43:07,449 --> 00:43:08,951
That's horrible.

797
00:43:08,952 --> 00:43:11,386
You're real funny
with the compliments there.

798
00:43:11,387 --> 00:43:16,191
I'm sorry.
- I guess I'll take it as such.

799
00:43:16,192 --> 00:43:18,560
What can I say,
I'm a cheap date.

800
00:43:18,561 --> 00:43:21,096
Incoming!

801
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:22,296
Coming at ya.

802
00:43:22,297 --> 00:43:24,332
Oh, what, wait.

803
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:27,636
Good job, you can
keep 'em cominin'.

804
00:43:27,637 --> 00:43:29,164
Keep 'em cominin', what's up?

805
00:43:30,005 --> 00:43:32,207
I thought you said one more?

806
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:33,542
Of each.

807
00:43:33,543 --> 00:43:35,743
Come on, 'bama slamma.

808
00:43:35,744 --> 00:43:37,946
'Bama slamma,
how do you spell that?

809
00:43:37,947 --> 00:43:40,515
Is that all one word there?

810
00:43:40,516 --> 00:43:43,780
You're asking too many questions
and need to be drinking again.

811
00:43:44,019 --> 00:43:46,154
Four, three, two, one.

812
00:43:46,155 --> 00:43:47,923
Why can't you be ugly?

813
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:53,562
That one's worse.

814
00:43:53,563 --> 00:43:56,464
These steadily get worse.

815
00:43:56,465 --> 00:43:59,767
Come on tough guy, it's time
to spin a lady proper.

816
00:43:59,768 --> 00:44:01,069
Oh, God.

817
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:04,305
Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on,
hold your thought, all right?

818
00:44:04,306 --> 00:44:06,140
Just hold the phone here.

819
00:44:06,141 --> 00:44:08,877
What?

820
00:44:08,878 --> 00:44:12,513
I really appreciate
what you're doing, all right?

821
00:44:12,514 --> 00:44:15,817
And I thank you,
but I think that...

822
00:44:15,818 --> 00:44:19,587
I think we're even.
- Steven?

823
00:44:19,588 --> 00:44:21,323
No, Guy.

824
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:23,892
Oh, wow, yeah.

825
00:44:23,893 --> 00:44:27,596
See what you did, you went
and got a man drunk here.

826
00:44:27,597 --> 00:44:30,499
Come on, I promise I won't
laugh at your dance moves,

827
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,533
even if they're terrible.

828
00:44:32,534 --> 00:44:37,339
Maybe I should sit back down
here or something?

829
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:40,542
Come on.
- Okay, okay.

830
00:44:40,543 --> 00:44:45,714
No, I'm afraid I can't,
but you are beautiful,

831
00:44:45,715 --> 00:44:47,850
all three of you.

832
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,819
Make sure you don't
regret this in the morning.

833
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:54,656
That is what
I'm in the mood for.

834
00:44:54,657 --> 00:45:00,766
Okay, don't make me
eat the peanuts.

835
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:07,368
It's a pleasure
to meet you, not Kim.

836
00:45:07,369 --> 00:45:10,339
And you not Steven.

837
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,407
Toodle loo.

838
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,855
You made the right decision.

839
00:45:27,856 --> 00:45:29,625
It was the right choice.

840
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:31,660
I couldn't help but overhear.

841
00:45:31,661 --> 00:45:34,562
You sort of dropped the ball
on that one, buddy.

842
00:45:34,563 --> 00:45:36,732
Well, maybe you be a little more
comfortable at that joint

843
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:39,834
around the corner?

844
00:45:39,835 --> 00:45:40,968
No, I'm good.

845
00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:43,138
I'll just take another drink.

846
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:45,974
All right, well,
I'm just trying to help.

847
00:45:51,447 --> 00:45:56,051
Wait, what joint
around the corner?

848
00:45:56,052 --> 00:46:01,689
Oh, you know,
it's a boys bar for the boys.

849
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:02,925
You don't say.

850
00:46:07,163 --> 00:46:08,364
* I want it *

851
00:46:13,235 --> 00:46:15,005
* I want it *

852
00:46:16,005 --> 00:46:18,207
* I want it *

853
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,341
* I want it *

854
00:46:20,342 --> 00:46:21,677
* Gimme some *

855
00:46:25,882 --> 00:46:27,348
* You make me wanna *

856
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:29,384
* Make me wanna *

857
00:46:29,385 --> 00:46:31,252
* I ain't tryin'
to fall in love *

858
00:46:31,253 --> 00:46:33,654
* I just wanna *

859
00:46:33,655 --> 00:46:35,891
- * I want it *
- * Come get *

860
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:47,103
* Baby, come and get it *

861
00:47:02,942 --> 00:47:03,785
* Taste it *

862
00:47:03,786 --> 00:47:04,752
* Touch it *

863
00:47:04,753 --> 00:47:05,687
* Prove it *

864
00:47:05,688 --> 00:47:06,622
* Move it *

865
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:07,555
* Groove it *

866
00:47:07,556 --> 00:47:08,290
* Hit it *

867
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:09,858
* Tap it *

868
00:47:12,762 --> 00:47:17,399
I should've gone in for the kiss
right then and there.

869
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,301
These kind of things
can't be rushed.

870
00:47:19,302 --> 00:47:21,435
Don't be so hard on yourself.

871
00:47:21,436 --> 00:47:24,506
Yeah, I just... I want it
to mean something, you know?

872
00:47:24,507 --> 00:47:26,040
I mean, I didn't care
if I was the last to kiss

873
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:30,712
out of all my friends,
but it had to be Eliza Bross,

874
00:47:30,713 --> 00:47:34,549
'cause I was in love
with Eliza Bross.

875
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,752
How old were you?
- Sixth grade.

876
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:39,388
Sixth grade, you weren't afraid
of catching cooties,

877
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:41,390
'cause I had that,
you don't want that stuff?

878
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:44,625
Wait, cooties are curable?
- No.

879
00:47:44,626 --> 00:47:46,194
No, you're just stuck with them?

880
00:47:46,195 --> 00:47:48,230
Yeah, they're just there.

881
00:47:48,231 --> 00:47:49,631
Well, good to know.

882
00:47:49,632 --> 00:47:51,799
When I was in third grade,
I rode my Schwinn

883
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,703
like 15 blocks to her house,
rang the doorbell, she answered,

884
00:47:55,704 --> 00:47:57,305
but I asked to speak
to her father.

885
00:47:57,306 --> 00:47:59,341
Said, "Sir, may I have
permission to take Eliza

886
00:47:59,342 --> 00:48:01,109
to the sixth grade dance."

887
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:02,743
In third grade?
- Yeah, man.

888
00:48:02,744 --> 00:48:07,582
I wanted to lock that down,
didn't want to take any chances.

889
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:10,218
I gave Craig Grayson
my red crown

890
00:48:10,219 --> 00:48:12,888
as a token of my love
in kindergarten.

891
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:15,290
Well, that is pretty adorable.

892
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:18,560
He ate it,
he just chewed it right up.

893
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:22,199
Guys can be such jerks,
never ends the way you think.

894
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:27,035
My first kiss was Jodie Fladal

895
00:48:27,036 --> 00:48:28,537
in the back of the library.

896
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:31,806
It didn't mean anything,
it was just a kiss.

897
00:48:31,807 --> 00:48:33,375
Life is cruel.

898
00:48:33,376 --> 00:48:36,111
Seventh grade, there was
a spin the bottle party

899
00:48:36,112 --> 00:48:37,578
and I was praying
the whole night

900
00:48:37,579 --> 00:48:39,714
that it would land on Craig,
but every time

901
00:48:39,715 --> 00:48:41,450
that stupid two liter
went around,

902
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:44,319
it was Arie Kowalski,
Arie Kowalski,

903
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,421
Arie Kowalski again!

904
00:48:46,422 --> 00:48:48,357
Seriously, it was like
that thing was magnetized

905
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:51,792
or something, we must've kissed
11 times that night.

906
00:48:51,793 --> 00:48:52,893
What?
- Yeah.

907
00:48:52,894 --> 00:48:54,763
You never got around
to kissing Craig?

908
00:48:54,764 --> 00:48:56,698
Well, by that point, me and Arie

909
00:48:56,699 --> 00:49:00,602
were pretty much boyfriend
and girlfriend, so...

910
00:49:00,603 --> 00:49:02,770
So...

911
00:49:02,771 --> 00:49:04,238
I don't know, I guess
I'm just not the type

912
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:06,207
to go around kissing whomever.

913
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:08,276
No, clearly.

914
00:49:08,277 --> 00:49:09,778
Hey, me and Arie dated

915
00:49:09,779 --> 00:49:12,147
actually until, like,
the tenth grade, so...

916
00:49:12,148 --> 00:49:15,917
Wow, by then,
Eliza was a lesbian.

917
00:49:15,918 --> 00:49:18,620
What about sixth grade dance?
- Oh, we went.

918
00:49:18,621 --> 00:49:21,089
No kiss, how could she resist?

919
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:23,859
Well, I didn't really possess
those skills back then,

920
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,895
but that didn't stop my sister
from draggin' me to dance class

921
00:49:26,896 --> 00:49:28,663
two times a week.

922
00:49:28,664 --> 00:49:30,364
There was no boys in the class,

923
00:49:30,365 --> 00:49:32,801
so she used to dress me up
in this, like, rhinestone outfit

924
00:49:33,001 --> 00:49:36,605
and made me practice with
all her friends after school.

925
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:39,508
Eventually, I picked up a couple
dance moves along the way.

926
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,142
Well, you see, I grew up
with five siblings,

927
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:43,412
so I learned to dance waiting
in line for the bathroom.

928
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:45,446
I noticed the pee-pee shuffle.

929
00:49:45,447 --> 00:49:46,816
Yeah, how'd that go again?

930
00:49:47,016 --> 00:49:50,722
Kind of like this, right?
- There it is, in the hips.

931
00:49:52,722 --> 00:49:54,555
Yeah, and what about
your sister?

932
00:49:54,556 --> 00:49:56,857
Is she still dressing you up
in all that glitter and...

933
00:49:56,858 --> 00:50:02,464
No, fortunately, she got married
and opened up a baby factory.

934
00:50:02,465 --> 00:50:04,533
Tell me about it, mine, too.

935
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:08,303
I'm just gonna have a boy first,
just one,

936
00:50:08,304 --> 00:50:09,638
and then three years later,
a girl,

937
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:11,205
and then I'm closing up shop.

938
00:50:11,206 --> 00:50:12,473
Yeah, just shutting
that shit down?

939
00:50:12,474 --> 00:50:17,111
Just sealing it up forever.

940
00:50:17,112 --> 00:50:21,183
* Where I am going *

941
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:28,556
* 'Cause I do things
that I have lost my way *

942
00:50:28,557 --> 00:50:31,228
Not many bars around here?

943
00:50:33,228 --> 00:50:35,129
What's wrong with the one
you're in?

944
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:37,966
I meant your phone reception.

945
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:39,468
Yeah.

946
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:42,404
I have full bars
if you want to call her.

947
00:50:42,405 --> 00:50:45,108
No thanks, I'm good.

948
00:50:52,114 --> 00:50:54,049
Need a drink?

949
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,951
You know what,
I'm actually gonna take off.

950
00:50:56,952 --> 00:50:59,453
Come on, just one.

951
00:50:59,454 --> 00:51:01,922
Just one?
- Yeah, just one.

952
00:51:01,923 --> 00:51:04,392
Thank you, but I'm not
accepting charity

953
00:51:04,393 --> 00:51:06,560
from pretty ladies anymore.

954
00:51:06,561 --> 00:51:09,430
Oh, that's a strange rule
for a guy.

955
00:51:09,431 --> 00:51:11,232
Strange rule for anyone really.

956
00:51:11,233 --> 00:51:13,033
You're a strange guy?

957
00:51:13,034 --> 00:51:15,403
Okay, kick a man when he's down.

958
00:51:15,404 --> 00:51:17,089
Aw, now I gotta buy you a drink.

959
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:19,306
Unless you wanna keep up
the illusion

960
00:51:19,307 --> 00:51:21,076
that you're just sitting
here alone.

961
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:23,879
I mean, she might still show.

962
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,716
Wow, do they teach you
this secret mind game

963
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:29,984
in some sort of school?

964
00:51:29,985 --> 00:51:32,053
It's pretty much innate.

965
00:51:32,054 --> 00:51:33,721
Let me ask you something.

966
00:51:33,722 --> 00:51:36,892
Why, why do girls do it?

967
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:39,895
Why give a guy your phone number
if you're not interested?

968
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:43,564
Why text him witty banter
throughout the day?

969
00:51:43,565 --> 00:51:48,203
And why set up a date if you
don't intend on keeping it?

970
00:51:48,204 --> 00:51:50,574
He'll have what I'm having.

971
00:51:52,293 --> 00:51:54,609
Yeah, I do get
the phone number thing though.

972
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:56,544
Do you?
- Yeah, of course.

973
00:51:56,545 --> 00:51:59,647
Because we put all this effort
into it and we get our hopes up

974
00:51:59,648 --> 00:52:02,049
and then we wait
the three days before calling,

975
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:05,453
but then we call and it goes
straight to voice mail.

976
00:52:05,454 --> 00:52:07,856
It crushes our hearts.

977
00:52:11,994 --> 00:52:13,395
Right on cue.

978
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:16,997
Oh no, it's not what
you think, trust me.

979
00:52:16,998 --> 00:52:19,701
It's just easier sometimes
with caller ID

980
00:52:19,702 --> 00:52:21,669
to just... not.

981
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:23,971
Why not just give him
a fake phone number then?

982
00:52:23,972 --> 00:52:26,040
That way he calls,
he doesn't get you,

983
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:28,310
end of social transaction.

984
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,245
But what if he calls
right in from of you

985
00:52:30,246 --> 00:52:32,647
and then you're busted,
so awkward?

986
00:52:32,648 --> 00:52:34,348
God forbid that the guy
you don't like

987
00:52:34,349 --> 00:52:36,183
and don't wanna spend
any time with knows

988
00:52:36,184 --> 00:52:38,553
you don't like him and don't
wanna spend any time with him.

989
00:52:38,554 --> 00:52:40,355
Okay, but what would you prefer,

990
00:52:40,356 --> 00:52:42,323
that she says
she has a boyfriend?

991
00:52:42,324 --> 00:52:47,128
I don't know, how 'bout that
you're just not feelin' it?

992
00:52:48,297 --> 00:52:50,332
I'm just not feelin' it.

993
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,701
You see, there you go?

994
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,736
And then I get up and walk away
and that's the end.

995
00:52:55,737 --> 00:52:58,305
I don't like that,
where's the fun in that?

996
00:52:58,306 --> 00:53:00,475
No, no, no, see,
none of this is fun

997
00:53:00,476 --> 00:53:02,743
on the guy's side,
it's all work.

998
00:53:02,744 --> 00:53:07,816
The fun comes, for lack
of a better term, when we do.

999
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:09,584
What a douche.

1000
00:53:09,585 --> 00:53:12,886
Exactly.

1001
00:53:12,887 --> 00:53:14,989
You're just enjoying
this whole thing.

1002
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:16,625
No.
- Yeah.

1003
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,459
Okay, maybe a little.
- Yeah, a little bit.

1004
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:21,663
But it's a laughing with,
enjoying with kind of thing.

1005
00:53:21,664 --> 00:53:24,232
Oh, good, good,
that gives me confidence.

1006
00:53:24,233 --> 00:53:25,600
Yeah.

1007
00:53:25,601 --> 00:53:27,868
What the hell is this,
it's yellow?

1008
00:53:27,869 --> 00:53:31,406
This is on behalf
of my entire gender,

1009
00:53:31,407 --> 00:53:33,908
since you were stood up,
an apology.

1010
00:53:33,909 --> 00:53:38,414
Okay, in that case,
keep 'em comin'.

1011
00:53:41,684 --> 00:53:46,521
Oh, no, not if you plan
on kissing me, deathly allergic.

1012
00:53:50,893 --> 00:53:52,300
All right.

1013
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,667
What is that?
- It's a protein bar.

1014
00:53:59,668 --> 00:54:02,837
We'll split it.
- Is that peanut butter?

1015
00:54:02,838 --> 00:54:05,573
What, oh shit, I forgot.

1016
00:54:05,574 --> 00:54:07,341
Unless you want me to go
into anaphylactic shock

1017
00:54:07,342 --> 00:54:09,044
with no chance
of getting me to a hospital,

1018
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,312
kindly put it away.

1019
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:11,846
All right, okay.

1020
00:54:11,847 --> 00:54:12,781
Over there, please.

1021
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:16,283
Okay.

1022
00:54:16,284 --> 00:54:20,221
FYI, girls like a guy
who listens.

1023
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:23,857
To everything?
- Deathly allergic.

1024
00:54:23,858 --> 00:54:24,959
I wasn't kidding.

1025
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,662
All right, I'm sorry.

1026
00:54:27,663 --> 00:54:30,000
I had a buddy
who was allergic to latex.

1027
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,567
Yeah, right.
- He is, what?

1028
00:54:33,568 --> 00:54:35,303
If condoms were made
of bubblegum,

1029
00:54:35,304 --> 00:54:37,971
then all guys would be allergic
to Bubblicious.

1030
00:54:37,972 --> 00:54:39,473
Okay, fair enough.

1031
00:54:39,474 --> 00:54:41,942
But I am actually allergic
to shellfish though.

1032
00:54:41,943 --> 00:54:43,310
Me, too.
- Oh, see?

1033
00:54:43,311 --> 00:54:44,745
We have another thing in common.

1034
00:54:44,746 --> 00:54:46,881
Along with coconuts,
cashews, Brazil nuts,

1035
00:54:46,882 --> 00:54:48,683
chocolates and bee stings.

1036
00:54:48,684 --> 00:54:51,486
Okay, not so much.

1037
00:54:51,487 --> 00:54:52,721
Does your throat close up?

1038
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:55,156
Do you get those
hives everywhere?

1039
00:54:55,157 --> 00:54:59,627
No, no, I just get drunk.
- What?

1040
00:54:59,628 --> 00:55:01,696
I know that it
sounds ridiculous,

1041
00:55:01,697 --> 00:55:04,499
but shellfish makes me
feel wasted.

1042
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:09,770
I slur my speech, I lose
my balance, I get all happy.

1043
00:55:09,771 --> 00:55:12,774
That's bullshit
and completely unfair.

1044
00:55:12,775 --> 00:55:15,310
Hey, it's no picnic,
I get that pit in my stomach

1045
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:20,247
every time I pass a Red Lobster,
I swear to God.

1046
00:55:20,248 --> 00:55:24,886
Well, if a bee comes near me,
it's no party, it's a funeral.

1047
00:55:24,887 --> 00:55:28,156
Oh, death by bee sting,
what a lousy way to go.

1048
00:55:28,157 --> 00:55:29,591
It almost happened once.

1049
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:31,459
I was at a family picnic
and I was walking

1050
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:34,395
and I stepped on a bee,
boom, anaphylactic shock.

1051
00:55:34,396 --> 00:55:35,796
The next thing I know,
I was on a gurney,

1052
00:55:35,797 --> 00:55:38,399
being rushed to the ER in front
of, like, a hundred

1053
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,734
of my relatives,
all panicked and neurotic,

1054
00:55:40,735 --> 00:55:44,939
hence the overcautious
handling of your...

1055
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,347
Were you about to say my nuts?

1056
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:53,281
You little, dirty girl.

1057
00:55:53,282 --> 00:55:55,482
Unbelievable.

1058
00:55:55,483 --> 00:55:57,551
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1059
00:55:57,552 --> 00:55:59,854
So, when we were like, you know,
fooling around or whatever

1060
00:55:59,855 --> 00:56:02,189
last night, I could've
killed you

1061
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:04,959
if I had a coconut daiquiri
or something?

1062
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,593
Well, I wouldn't have
gone home with you

1063
00:56:06,594 --> 00:56:08,229
if you'd had a coconut daiquiri,

1064
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:11,899
but I might've swelled up
and fainted.

1065
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,070
My kiss does have that effect
on women.

1066
00:56:27,115 --> 00:56:28,985
Kim.

1067
00:56:29,985 --> 00:56:32,319
Yeah?

1068
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:36,056
Wow, it's nice
to actually meet you.

1069
00:56:36,057 --> 00:56:37,057
You, too.

1070
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:39,727
Rob said to look for the girl

1071
00:56:39,728 --> 00:56:43,064
who walks into the bar
like she owns the place, so.

1072
00:56:43,065 --> 00:56:46,067
Oh, okay.

1073
00:56:46,068 --> 00:56:48,303
You're on a blind date?

1074
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:49,304
Yeah, aren't you?

1075
00:56:51,172 --> 00:56:53,575
Oh, okay, I'm confused

1076
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,109
you just said that you were Kim.

1077
00:56:55,110 --> 00:57:00,848
Oh, I know, I just kinda
wanted to go with it, sorry.

1078
00:57:00,849 --> 00:57:04,852
Wha... hold on, what if you are
Kim, but you're not telling me

1079
00:57:04,853 --> 00:57:07,921
'cause, you know,
you don't think I'm cute.

1080
00:57:07,922 --> 00:57:09,156
Aw.

1081
00:57:09,157 --> 00:57:10,825
No, I think you're cute.

1082
00:57:10,826 --> 00:57:13,761
* Let's play a game *

1083
00:57:13,762 --> 00:57:16,230
What am I supposed
to do with that?

1084
00:57:16,231 --> 00:57:18,966
* I will be the good *

1085
00:57:18,967 --> 00:57:22,236
I'll take it now.

1086
00:57:22,237 --> 00:57:24,907
Hey, hey, excuse me.

1087
00:57:25,907 --> 00:57:27,207
Hi.

1088
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:29,276
Um, can I get a Jack and coke?

1089
00:57:29,277 --> 00:57:30,845
More Jack than coke.

1090
00:57:30,846 --> 00:57:37,084
* Ask 'em why we can't
just get along *

1091
00:57:37,085 --> 00:57:42,991
* And if they don't answer
to my big knife *

1092
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:49,163
* You can pull out your 45 *

1093
00:57:49,164 --> 00:57:53,003
* And they can beg
for their lives *

1094
00:57:58,106 --> 00:58:04,578
* Let's play a game called
"Good cop, Bad cop", *

1095
00:58:04,579 --> 00:58:10,285
* You can be the good,
I will be the bad *

1096
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:17,692
* Let's find the lovers
who broke our hearts *

1097
00:58:17,693 --> 00:58:22,266
* And shoot 'em down
just for fun *

1098
00:58:24,266 --> 00:58:27,100
He isn't really
a black belt, is he?

1099
00:58:27,101 --> 00:58:28,636
That was the one before.

1100
00:58:28,637 --> 00:58:29,637
Oh.

1101
00:58:31,172 --> 00:58:33,808
Yup.

1102
00:58:33,809 --> 00:58:35,646
Yup, yup what?

1103
00:58:37,646 --> 00:58:38,712
Nothin'.

1104
00:58:38,713 --> 00:58:40,714
No, yup something,
or no yup at all,

1105
00:58:40,715 --> 00:58:42,616
so what's up with the yup?

1106
00:58:42,617 --> 00:58:45,720
Yup, you're the type of girl
that always has a boyfriend.

1107
00:58:45,721 --> 00:58:49,089
Oh, yup, pretty much
since high school.

1108
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:51,892
I could tell, you got that vibe.

1109
00:58:51,893 --> 00:58:53,794
I don't have vibe.

1110
00:58:53,795 --> 00:58:54,895
You don't?

1111
00:58:54,896 --> 00:58:58,232
Okay, what were you
doing three years ago

1112
00:58:58,233 --> 00:59:00,734
for New Year's Eve?

1113
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,401
Random.

1114
00:59:01,402 --> 00:59:03,937
What were you doing?

1115
00:59:03,938 --> 00:59:04,906
I was with Rick in Aruba.

1116
00:59:04,907 --> 00:59:06,040
Right.

1117
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:08,176
You were with Rick in Aruba.

1118
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:11,812
You weren't in Aruba with Rick,
you were with Rick in Aruba.

1119
00:59:11,813 --> 00:59:12,913
Yeah, so?

1120
00:59:12,914 --> 00:59:14,415
So you figure out
what you were doing

1121
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:16,384
based on who you were with,
you know?

1122
00:59:16,385 --> 00:59:18,886
Like it's a measurement of time.

1123
00:59:18,887 --> 00:59:20,821
That's a serial
monogamist talking.

1124
00:59:20,822 --> 00:59:23,086
All right, what's your
longest relationship?

1125
00:59:24,025 --> 00:59:24,526
This.

1126
00:59:24,726 --> 00:59:25,926
Exactly.

1127
00:59:25,927 --> 00:59:27,794
Okay, what's your
shortest relationship?

1128
00:59:27,795 --> 00:59:29,129
This.
- Right.

1129
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:31,031
So you're a serial monogamist.

1130
00:59:31,032 --> 00:59:32,332
And you're a serial datist.

1131
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:34,301
Okay, well,
what do we have in common?

1132
00:59:34,302 --> 00:59:36,940
The beginning
of a really bad joke?

1133
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:42,343
Look, I admit, I've had my fair
share of meaningless sex,

1134
00:59:42,344 --> 00:59:44,879
but I haven't done this
in quite a while.

1135
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,381
Oh, that's comforting.

1136
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:51,021
Yeah, I sort of made a vow
not to do this anymore.

1137
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:53,257
Like ever.

1138
00:59:55,257 --> 00:59:57,991
You took... Oh, my God,
you're married?

1139
00:59:57,992 --> 00:59:59,259
No, I'm...

1140
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:00,162
Yes, you are!

1141
01:00:00,362 --> 01:00:02,330
No, trust me, I'm not married!

1142
01:00:02,331 --> 01:00:03,830
Then what are you talking about?

1143
01:00:03,831 --> 01:00:05,899
Look, I can't meet a real girl

1144
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:09,037
if I'm bangin' a bunch
of worthless chicks.

1145
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:09,805
Not cool!
- Okay,

1146
01:00:10,005 --> 01:00:11,305
worthless to me!

1147
01:00:11,306 --> 01:00:12,540
I don't mean you're worthless.

1148
01:00:12,541 --> 01:00:13,774
Oh, I... I'm sorry, stop!

1149
01:00:13,775 --> 01:00:16,109
Please, stop hitting me
for just a second

1150
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:18,353
and let me explain, all right?

1151
01:00:24,353 --> 01:00:25,819
It's been seven months

1152
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:29,723
since I woke up next
to this random Asian girl

1153
01:00:29,724 --> 01:00:31,359
whose name I still
don't remember,

1154
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,993
and I promised myself right then

1155
01:00:32,994 --> 01:00:39,033
that I wasn't gonna have anymore
unemotional sex ever again.

1156
01:00:39,034 --> 01:00:40,600
Well, you need to work on that.

1157
01:00:40,601 --> 01:00:43,875
Yeah, well, I was doin' fine
up until I met you.

1158
01:00:46,875 --> 01:00:49,679
So, then why break
this mighty vow over me?

1159
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:54,816
Call it a moment of weakness.

1160
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:57,984
Wow, you really know
how to make a girl feel special.

1161
01:00:57,985 --> 01:00:59,120
I wasn't trying to...

1162
01:00:59,121 --> 01:01:00,648
Oh, smooth, yeah, keep going.

1163
01:01:01,023 --> 01:01:03,156
No, that's... that's
not what I meant.

1164
01:01:03,157 --> 01:01:04,058
I meant that...
- So what,

1165
01:01:04,059 --> 01:01:05,225
this is all my fault?

1166
01:01:05,226 --> 01:01:06,960
You could've said "No",
you know.

1167
01:01:06,961 --> 01:01:08,796
I believe that I tried.

1168
01:01:08,797 --> 01:01:10,131
Who the hell knows

1169
01:01:10,132 --> 01:01:11,933
with all the poison you
were feeding me last night.

1170
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:14,634
So what, I... I got you drunk
and took advantage?

1171
01:01:14,635 --> 01:01:16,907
Both of those things did happen.

1172
01:01:18,907 --> 01:01:19,907
Shit.

1173
01:01:21,076 --> 01:01:22,877
You didn't stand a chance.

1174
01:01:22,878 --> 01:01:24,946
I'm the reason that
girls think guys are jerks.

1175
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:28,249
I'm... I'm that girl,
I hate that girl.

1176
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,283
I give girls like me a bad name!

1177
01:01:30,284 --> 01:01:32,053
I just gave myself a bad name!

1178
01:01:32,054 --> 01:01:35,823
You know how hard it is to not
have sex for seven months?

1179
01:01:35,824 --> 01:01:38,859
Please, I was in
a relationship for six years

1180
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,460
that should have been
over after four.

1181
01:01:40,461 --> 01:01:42,796
I get not having sex
for a while.

1182
01:01:42,797 --> 01:01:43,964
Jesus.

1183
01:01:43,965 --> 01:01:45,399
Yeah.

1184
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,801
You're like the poster child
for monogamy.

1185
01:01:47,001 --> 01:01:49,770
Well, which is why I don't
have genital herpes, so.

1186
01:01:49,771 --> 01:01:52,739
Oh, that's good to know.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

1187
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:56,611
All right, so since we're here,
you know,

1188
01:01:56,612 --> 01:02:00,180
and we did what
we did last night,

1189
01:02:00,181 --> 01:02:03,049
there's something
I wanna ask you.

1190
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:04,820
Do I...

1191
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:07,360
...do I-...

1192
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,728
Never mind.

1193
01:02:13,728 --> 01:02:15,562
You did not just do that.

1194
01:02:15,563 --> 01:02:16,997
Okay, I'm sorry that I did that,
I hate it when people do that,

1195
01:02:16,998 --> 01:02:19,399
but... I just don't
wanna talk about it.

1196
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,067
Come on, just say it.

1197
01:02:21,068 --> 01:02:24,016
No, I don't, just forget it,
forget I ever said anything.

1198
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:30,111
What the hell was that?

1199
01:02:30,112 --> 01:02:31,245
What are you talking about?

1200
01:02:31,246 --> 01:02:33,381
What... that is very bizarre.

1201
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:35,348
You freaked the guy out
right next to us.

1202
01:02:35,349 --> 01:02:37,752
What guy?
- He's a sensitive soul.

1203
01:02:37,753 --> 01:02:39,120
Yeah, right.

1204
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:41,964
Are you gonna ask me what
you were gonna ask me or not?

1205
01:02:45,594 --> 01:02:47,929
Do I look like
a epileptic when I cum?

1206
01:02:50,965 --> 01:02:52,633
What?

1207
01:02:52,634 --> 01:02:54,267
Totally, is that what
you were gonna ask me?

1208
01:02:54,268 --> 01:02:56,303
Wait, I do, seriously?

1209
01:02:56,304 --> 01:02:57,971
Yeah.
- Shit, really?

1210
01:02:57,972 --> 01:03:01,342
Yeah, you go",
yeah, you like that?"

1211
01:03:02,878 --> 01:03:05,046
What, that's not what,
no, come on.

1212
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:07,781
I literally thought
that you'd stuck your foot

1213
01:03:07,782 --> 01:03:10,718
in like an electrical socket
or something.

1214
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:12,920
That's just... that's stupid.

1215
01:03:15,791 --> 01:03:19,293
Okay, okay, I get it,
you can stop laughing at me.

1216
01:03:21,822 --> 01:03:23,296
With the eye and everything?

1217
01:03:23,297 --> 01:03:24,833
What, I look like Popeye.

1218
01:03:26,768 --> 01:03:29,569
That's ridiculous, I don't
even wanna look at myself.

1219
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:30,671
Geez.

1220
01:03:30,672 --> 01:03:32,239
Did somebody actually
say this to you?

1221
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,241
Yes, yes, but she wasn't
wearing her glasses

1222
01:03:34,242 --> 01:03:35,542
when we were doin' it,

1223
01:03:35,543 --> 01:03:37,701
so I didn't know if she
was to be trusted.

1224
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,281
It's just weird, I just... I've
practiced this in the mirror

1225
01:03:41,282 --> 01:03:42,783
like a million times,

1226
01:03:42,784 --> 01:03:45,085
but every time I start
to get there my eyes close,

1227
01:03:45,086 --> 01:03:46,402
and I can't see anything.

1228
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:49,689
No, I'm serious.

1229
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:53,593
I literally, I physically
cannot, I know,

1230
01:03:53,594 --> 01:03:56,730
I can't keep my eyes open,
there's no... it's like a sneeze.

1231
01:03:56,731 --> 01:03:59,267
Like they just shut, you know?

1232
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:00,667
And then after that
I'm just like,

1233
01:04:00,668 --> 01:04:04,072
"Who gives a shit
what I look like."

1234
01:04:05,974 --> 01:04:08,878
Oh, God, oh.

1235
01:04:09,709 --> 01:04:12,078
There's something you should
know, by the way,

1236
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:13,113
something else.

1237
01:04:13,114 --> 01:04:14,848
What, oh God.
- No... no.

1238
01:04:14,849 --> 01:04:17,651
Last... it's just that last night
when I was down there,

1239
01:04:17,652 --> 01:04:21,891
you know, I didn't actually,
I didn't actually swallow.

1240
01:04:22,891 --> 01:04:24,225
Wait, you didn't?

1241
01:04:24,226 --> 01:04:27,231
No, I just... I spit it out
on the floor.

1242
01:04:29,231 --> 01:04:31,966
Hold on, how the hell
did I not know what?

1243
01:04:31,967 --> 01:04:33,634
What are you a magician?

1244
01:04:33,635 --> 01:04:35,268
I'm just wondering,
because, you know,

1245
01:04:35,269 --> 01:04:37,837
it's not like I was in
a meeting, I was right there.

1246
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:40,154
I know, well, you were
in the throes of your.

1247
01:04:40,742 --> 01:04:42,709
Okay, all right,
we've covered that.

1248
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:44,678
I don't know,
that's a little weird.

1249
01:04:44,679 --> 01:04:47,574
And expecting me to swallow
a stranger's man milk isn't?

1250
01:04:48,016 --> 01:04:51,084
I don't know, it's
a recreational hazard, right?

1251
01:04:51,085 --> 01:04:54,254
Unless it's on your allergen
list, what's the big deal?

1252
01:04:54,255 --> 01:04:55,656
It's just really personal,
you know,

1253
01:04:55,657 --> 01:04:57,457
if we were dating
it would be different.

1254
01:04:57,458 --> 01:04:59,893
Okay, how does the definition of
a relationship change anything?

1255
01:04:59,894 --> 01:05:01,861
You're either doin'
what you're doin'

1256
01:05:01,862 --> 01:05:03,730
with the guy you're doin'
it with, or you're not.

1257
01:05:03,731 --> 01:05:05,899
Well, sue me for wanting to know
a guy a little better

1258
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:08,268
before I have a pool party
in my stomach

1259
01:05:08,269 --> 01:05:10,671
with 100 million
of his closes friends.

1260
01:05:10,672 --> 01:05:13,107
Wow, that is a case
that I just might pursue,

1261
01:05:13,108 --> 01:05:14,908
right there, council.

1262
01:05:14,909 --> 01:05:18,779
I mean, you know, you spit out
my essence like a Gobstopper.

1263
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:19,980
Come on.
- You kill a country

1264
01:05:20,014 --> 01:05:21,082
full of my DNA.

1265
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,049
That's... that's genocide!

1266
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:24,118
You're a monster!

1267
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:25,319
Oh, my God!

1268
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,054
You're a Republican.

1269
01:05:27,971 --> 01:05:29,656
My parents are both Republicans,

1270
01:05:29,657 --> 01:05:31,258
but just 'cause
they wanna save money.

1271
01:05:31,259 --> 01:05:33,259
They're pro-choice,
and for gay rights,

1272
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,761
it doesn't make an sense.

1273
01:05:34,762 --> 01:05:36,930
Yeah, well, my sister's
a ham-eating Jew,

1274
01:05:36,931 --> 01:05:39,899
what are you gonna do?

1275
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,801
I find it interesting
that people just

1276
01:05:41,802 --> 01:05:44,171
hear the parts that
they wanna hear.

1277
01:05:44,172 --> 01:05:45,939
I'm sorry,
did you say something?

1278
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:47,207
Pork is nasty.

1279
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:51,511
Well, we can finally
agree on something.

1280
01:05:51,512 --> 01:05:52,747
I used to eat
all kinds of animal

1281
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:54,848
before I watched
this documentary.

1282
01:05:54,849 --> 01:05:56,850
Oh, no, come on, come on,
please, don't with that

1283
01:05:56,851 --> 01:05:58,618
'cause I... I really
love me some steak,

1284
01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:00,187
and I don't wanna ruin it.

1285
01:06:00,188 --> 01:06:01,888
You think that that's better?

1286
01:06:01,889 --> 01:06:04,825
They hang the animal upside
down, and they slit its throat

1287
01:06:04,826 --> 01:06:06,694
and they just let it
bleed out on the floor!

1288
01:06:06,695 --> 01:06:08,294
La-la-la,
don't ruin this for me!

1289
01:06:08,295 --> 01:06:09,863
Just a minute ago,
you were talkin' about

1290
01:06:09,864 --> 01:06:12,933
how you swallowed my, you know,
my... however you put it,

1291
01:06:12,934 --> 01:06:13,968
can we just get back to that!

1292
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:15,669
No, 'cause I didn't!

1293
01:06:15,670 --> 01:06:17,805
Yeah, I know you didn't,
but you acted like you did,

1294
01:06:18,005 --> 01:06:20,808
which I thought was
really sweet, really.

1295
01:06:20,809 --> 01:06:25,046
La-la-la-la-la-la!

1296
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:26,279
Okay, you're safe.

1297
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:29,049
Promise?
- Yeah.

1298
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:34,087
It's just that there's all this
fecal matter in the hamburger.

1299
01:06:34,088 --> 01:06:36,189
Oh, you went
to the fecal matter.

1300
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:37,625
I'm sorry.
- That's ridiculous.

1301
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:38,927
Done, sustained!

1302
01:06:39,927 --> 01:06:41,361
People like you.

1303
01:06:41,362 --> 01:06:44,198
All you wanna do is lock people
up in your tofu jail,

1304
01:06:44,199 --> 01:06:46,033
you blood-sucking lawyer.

1305
01:06:46,034 --> 01:06:48,134
You're the one that wanted
to be dead honest.

1306
01:06:48,135 --> 01:06:49,870
Yeah, but not about that.

1307
01:06:49,871 --> 01:06:51,171
In fact, not about anything

1308
01:06:51,172 --> 01:06:53,973
that would change
my view on anything.

1309
01:06:53,974 --> 01:06:55,341
Way to grow.

1310
01:06:55,342 --> 01:06:58,111
You slap me, you call me names.

1311
01:06:58,112 --> 01:07:00,980
I didn't call you any names,
what names did I call you?

1312
01:07:00,981 --> 01:07:03,951
Layman?

1313
01:07:03,952 --> 01:07:05,953
Oh, well, I'm sure
you've been called worse.

1314
01:07:05,954 --> 01:07:07,054
And Steven.

1315
01:07:08,989 --> 01:07:10,658
That's pretty bad.

1316
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:12,792
And now I don't know if I can
eat a hamburger anymore.

1317
01:07:12,793 --> 01:07:15,062
Oh boo-hoo,
I ruined Hanukah.

1318
01:07:15,063 --> 01:07:16,296
Whoa-whoa-whoa,
hold on.

1319
01:07:16,297 --> 01:07:17,997
Do you know the license
plate to this car?

1320
01:07:17,998 --> 01:07:19,533
No, how would I?

1321
01:07:19,534 --> 01:07:23,104
Yeah, it's APR-15,
do you know what that means?

1322
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:24,270
April 15th?

1323
01:07:24,271 --> 01:07:27,073
April 15th, and you know why?

1324
01:07:27,074 --> 01:07:28,741
Because it's my car,

1325
01:07:28,742 --> 01:07:32,413
it's registered to me under
my name, my address, my car,

1326
01:07:32,414 --> 01:07:33,781
that means my rules.

1327
01:07:33,782 --> 01:07:35,850
When you're in your car
it's your rules,

1328
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:38,986
but now you're in my car,
April 15th, my rules.

1329
01:07:38,987 --> 01:07:40,187
Okay, Dad.

1330
01:07:40,188 --> 01:07:41,921
Okay, so you go over
to your window

1331
01:07:41,922 --> 01:07:44,792
and think about what you've
done, I'm callin' five minutes.

1332
01:07:44,793 --> 01:07:46,160
You can't call five minutes,
that's my thing!

1333
01:07:46,161 --> 01:07:47,931
April 15th!

1334
01:08:12,853 --> 01:08:17,124
* If we're both
not married by 22 *

1335
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:20,961
* Could I be so bold
and ask you *

1336
01:08:20,962 --> 01:08:26,200
* If we're both
not married by 23 *

1337
01:08:26,201 --> 01:08:30,737
* Will you make my year,
and ask me *

1338
01:08:30,738 --> 01:08:34,841
* If we're both
not married by 24 *

1339
01:08:34,842 --> 01:08:37,077
* Will you pass me
those knee pads *

1340
01:08:37,078 --> 01:08:38,845
Oh, whoa, don't cry.

1341
01:08:38,846 --> 01:08:42,116
Do not cry, it's ladies night.

1342
01:08:42,117 --> 01:08:46,386
There is no crying
on ladies night.

1343
01:08:46,387 --> 01:08:49,689
Smile, there's
free drinks till nine.

1344
01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:52,796
There we go, that's a smile,
come on, free drinks till nine.

1345
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:55,528
Free drinks till nine?

1346
01:08:55,529 --> 01:08:56,663
Beautiful ladies
that are crying,

1347
01:08:56,664 --> 01:08:58,802
double free drinks till nine.

1348
01:09:01,802 --> 01:09:03,770
Yes!

1349
01:09:03,771 --> 01:09:07,444
Yes, all right,
you're gonna have fun.

1350
01:09:09,444 --> 01:09:10,844
You see that shit?

1351
01:09:10,845 --> 01:09:12,845
I'm gonna hit that,
oh, I'm gonna hit that.

1352
01:09:12,846 --> 01:09:16,416
* My hand when I go,
will you hold *

1353
01:09:16,417 --> 01:09:21,054
* My hand when I go,
will you hold my hand *

1354
01:09:21,055 --> 01:09:22,226
* When I go *

1355
01:09:25,226 --> 01:09:27,395
Kim.
- Yeah.

1356
01:09:42,644 --> 01:09:46,679
* If I get to 30
and I don't have a wife *

1357
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:50,783
* I'll ask you nicely,
but I won't ask twice *

1358
01:09:50,784 --> 01:09:55,889
* If I get to 40
and I don't have a spouse *

1359
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:58,027
Boom, whoa-ho-ho!

1360
01:09:59,027 --> 01:10:00,659
Who calls that on a river, man?

1361
01:10:01,029 --> 01:10:02,963
I don't know who does it.

1362
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:09,836
* If I get to 60
will you let me slip away *

1363
01:10:09,837 --> 01:10:13,706
* Into an armchair
for the rest of my days *

1364
01:10:13,707 --> 01:10:15,908
* 'Cause you've got your family
and I've got mine *

1365
01:10:15,909 --> 01:10:19,679
Did you give her a kiss
and say you're sorry?

1366
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,047
You guys could do
a high-five, yeah.

1367
01:10:21,048 --> 01:10:23,020
Can you blow it,
oh, that's good.

1368
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:28,221
Yeah, no really.

1369
01:10:28,222 --> 01:10:31,959
Tell me, tell me the truth.

1370
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,929
You know you miss me.

1371
01:10:37,765 --> 01:10:41,168
What time is firework spectacle?

1372
01:10:44,372 --> 01:10:46,943
Is this the line
for Space Mountain?

1373
01:10:48,678 --> 01:10:50,678
And finally, an update
for those of you

1374
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:53,212
stuck in that dead-stop
traffic jam, it turns out,

1375
01:10:53,213 --> 01:10:54,415
and get a load of this,

1376
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:56,617
the reason for the delay
is because of a.

1377
01:10:56,618 --> 01:11:00,953
* My hand when I go,
will you hold my hand *

1378
01:11:00,954 --> 01:11:02,890
* When I go *

1379
01:11:06,828 --> 01:11:08,929
Okay, okay.

1380
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:11,064
Okay, okay.

1381
01:11:11,065 --> 01:11:13,167
You can handle this.

1382
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:31,085
Oh, God.

1383
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:54,140
Oh, no.

1384
01:11:54,141 --> 01:11:55,408
What?

1385
01:11:55,409 --> 01:11:57,544
I think we're starting to move.

1386
01:11:57,545 --> 01:11:58,545
Oh.

1387
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,984
Great.

1388
01:12:03,984 --> 01:12:05,385
Just.

1389
01:12:05,386 --> 01:12:07,796
I'll make sure that.

1390
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:16,229
I think you're seat
was a little more.

1391
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:18,599
Oh, just a little more up?
- Yeah.

1392
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,099
Like that?
- Like, yeah.

1393
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,101
There we go.

1394
01:12:21,869 --> 01:12:23,105
Okay, all right!

1395
01:12:25,105 --> 01:12:26,840
Hold on.
- What?

1396
01:12:26,841 --> 01:12:27,341
Seatbelt.

1397
01:12:27,342 --> 01:12:28,976
Right.

1398
01:13:03,077 --> 01:13:06,779
I got it, Dad.

1399
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:08,782
Yes, I'm not
sleeping with anybody,

1400
01:13:08,783 --> 01:13:10,783
you can... you can
let mom know that.

1401
01:13:10,784 --> 01:13:12,786
I gotta go into this thing,
all right, I love you.

1402
01:13:12,787 --> 01:13:14,654
Ladies lookin' right
on Ladies Night.

1403
01:13:14,655 --> 01:13:17,925
Come on, it's free cover!
- No!

1404
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:18,827
Hey.

1405
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:20,095
It's ten bucks, bro.

1406
01:13:22,095 --> 01:13:23,063
It's ten bucks.

1407
01:13:23,064 --> 01:13:24,063
Right.

1408
01:13:24,064 --> 01:13:26,366
That's, okay, man.

1409
01:13:26,367 --> 01:13:28,068
Hey, you have a good time.

1410
01:13:28,069 --> 01:13:29,336
* Gonna kick in my door *

1411
01:13:29,337 --> 01:13:31,671
* I'm dating defeat *

1412
01:13:31,672 --> 01:13:34,107
* I got no friends
'cause the damage is done *

1413
01:13:34,108 --> 01:13:36,944
* I am packin' my bags *

1414
01:13:42,149 --> 01:13:43,884
What'll it be?

1415
01:13:43,885 --> 01:13:47,521
Oh, I'm... I'm actually
waiting for somebody, so.

1416
01:13:56,631 --> 01:13:59,966
So, what you're just gonna
sit at my bar and not drink?

1417
01:13:59,967 --> 01:14:02,836
No, I'm... I'm gonna drink,
I'm just gonna wait for her,

1418
01:14:02,837 --> 01:14:05,175
and then we'll both...
- Cheap asshole.

1419
01:14:07,175 --> 01:14:08,175
What?

1420
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:18,463
* You and I, you and I,
you and I, you and I *

1421
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:21,755
* All we need is who we are *

1422
01:14:21,756 --> 01:14:25,157
* We can be, we can be,

1423
01:14:25,158 --> 01:14:28,095
* Brighter than
a shooting star *

1424
01:14:41,943 --> 01:14:43,977
Hey.

1425
01:14:43,978 --> 01:14:46,045
Hey, you made it.

1426
01:14:46,046 --> 01:14:46,815
How you doin', Dad?

1427
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:48,348
I'm doing good.

1428
01:14:48,349 --> 01:14:50,019
How about you?

1429
01:14:50,934 --> 01:14:51,619
Are you good?

1430
01:14:51,819 --> 01:14:53,086
Yeah, I'm fine.

1431
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:54,654
You sure?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1432
01:14:54,655 --> 01:14:56,156
Okay, I've been
bragging about you

1433
01:14:56,157 --> 01:14:58,058
to your Uncle Ken
and his wife Stella.

1434
01:14:58,059 --> 01:14:59,992
Okay.

1435
01:14:59,993 --> 01:15:01,528
Holly!

1436
01:15:01,529 --> 01:15:02,929
Hello.

1437
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:06,800
Look how beautiful you are!
- Thank you.

1438
01:15:06,801 --> 01:15:10,804
So which one of these gorgeous
little kids are yours?

1439
01:15:10,805 --> 01:15:11,805
I'm not married.

1440
01:15:12,006 --> 01:15:14,428
Oh, well, I don't think
you have to be anymore.

1441
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:20,880
Oh, there she is with dad,

1442
01:15:20,881 --> 01:15:23,082
talking to cousins
number 28 and 29.

1443
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:27,386
No, that's definitely some kind
of aunt and uncle of some sort.

1444
01:15:27,387 --> 01:15:28,854
Oh, God, she's giving me
the "save me" eyes.

1445
01:15:28,855 --> 01:15:30,256
Quick, call her over.

1446
01:15:30,257 --> 01:15:33,093
Your face was blown up like
a big tomato, the bee sting,

1447
01:15:33,094 --> 01:15:34,200
do you remember that?

1448
01:15:35,963 --> 01:15:38,000
Oh, my God, we've had
so much fun.

1449
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,867
Hols!

1450
01:15:41,868 --> 01:15:50,309
Oh, sorry, so nice to meet
you Uncle Ken, Aunt Stella.

1451
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:52,278
What is she doing with her hair?

1452
01:15:52,279 --> 01:15:54,246
Okay, stop it.

1453
01:15:54,247 --> 01:15:55,148
Thanks, guys.

1454
01:15:55,149 --> 01:15:56,916
Hey, sis, nice shoes.

1455
01:15:56,917 --> 01:15:59,152
Oh, thanks, you've
seen these before.

1456
01:15:59,153 --> 01:16:00,153
I know.

1457
01:16:02,055 --> 01:16:03,055
Where's, Rick?

1458
01:16:03,056 --> 01:16:04,090
Oh, yeah.

1459
01:16:04,091 --> 01:16:06,962
Oh, he's, he's good.

1460
01:16:07,962 --> 01:16:11,131
Um, where is he?

1461
01:16:13,134 --> 01:16:14,800
Oh, no.
- What happened?

1462
01:16:14,801 --> 01:16:16,370
Noth... what are you
talking about?

1463
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:18,772
Oh, shut up, again?

1464
01:16:18,773 --> 01:16:21,942
You know, it's for the best,
it wasn't right.

1465
01:16:21,943 --> 01:16:23,242
He wasn't ready, you know.

1466
01:16:23,243 --> 01:16:25,144
But why... why are
they all never ready?

1467
01:16:25,145 --> 01:16:29,916
I don't know, but I'm not gonna
waste my time, so.

1468
01:16:29,917 --> 01:16:31,917
Well, we're way past that
point by now, aren't we?

1469
01:16:31,918 --> 01:16:33,786
Oh yeah, I mean,
after three years,

1470
01:16:33,787 --> 01:16:35,788
he's still not sure at this age?

1471
01:16:35,789 --> 01:16:37,323
There must be
something else going on.

1472
01:16:37,324 --> 01:16:40,093
I mean, this is crazy,
he was a good one.

1473
01:16:40,094 --> 01:16:42,962
Yeah.
- Not to mention, gorgeous!

1474
01:16:42,963 --> 01:16:46,399
I mean, I completely
picture you two together.

1475
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,867
You're a cute couple!

1476
01:16:47,868 --> 01:16:49,635
What exactly did you do?

1477
01:16:49,636 --> 01:16:50,871
I didn't do anything.

1478
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:52,371
Well, maybe that's the issue.

1479
01:16:52,372 --> 01:16:53,739
Oh, yeah, remember when
you broke up with Max,

1480
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:55,375
and he said he felt like
he wasn't number one.

1481
01:16:55,376 --> 01:16:57,144
Wasn't it
the same with David, too?

1482
01:16:57,145 --> 01:16:58,679
There's something with you?

1483
01:16:58,680 --> 01:16:59,946
Excuse me?
- Be nice.

1484
01:16:59,947 --> 01:17:01,313
I am nice.

1485
01:17:01,314 --> 01:17:03,416
Did you ever think
that maybe it's not me,

1486
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:05,352
maybe it's them?

1487
01:17:05,353 --> 01:17:07,254
You're the only
common denominator

1488
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:08,988
in your relationships, Holly.

1489
01:17:08,989 --> 01:17:11,621
Well, there still must be
some way we can fix this.

1490
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:13,894
There's nothing to fix.

1491
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:17,296
I just think the fixing maybe
needs to happen right here.

1492
01:17:17,297 --> 01:17:18,898
Still, not nice.

1493
01:17:18,899 --> 01:17:20,901
Vicious.
- Well, she's drunk.

1494
01:17:20,902 --> 01:17:23,639
I mean, it's the truth,
she just needs to swallow it.

1495
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:28,108
Okay, I'm done.
- No, sweetie!

1496
01:17:28,109 --> 01:17:30,943
Just don't do anything
before you think about it.

1497
01:17:30,944 --> 01:17:31,944
Those shoes.

1498
01:17:33,747 --> 01:17:36,051
It's, this red one up here.

1499
01:17:39,252 --> 01:17:40,252
This is me.

1500
01:17:48,162 --> 01:17:49,162
So.
- So.

1501
01:17:57,904 --> 01:18:01,241
I think I found a way
for you to keep your record.

1502
01:18:01,242 --> 01:18:03,109
My record?
- Yeah.

1503
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:07,581
Oh, of, never having done
this one-night thing before.

1504
01:18:07,582 --> 01:18:09,349
Oh, my record.
- Yeah.

1505
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:12,818
Well, I'm not sure that's what
this still is, technically.

1506
01:18:12,819 --> 01:18:14,420
Well, I think technically it is,
you know,

1507
01:18:14,421 --> 01:18:16,322
until we do it again.

1508
01:18:16,323 --> 01:18:19,760
So, that's all
we have to do, right?

1509
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:21,894
You know, see each other again
is what I'm proposing,

1510
01:18:21,895 --> 01:18:23,130
not just like.

1511
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:25,197
Oh yeah, for
the sake of my record.

1512
01:18:25,198 --> 01:18:28,068
Strictly for that, yes.

1513
01:18:28,069 --> 01:18:30,774
Yeah, okay, okay.

1514
01:18:32,774 --> 01:18:36,143
Nice to meet you, Guy, really.

1515
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:37,979
Actually.

1516
01:18:38,979 --> 01:18:41,314
You, too, Holly.

1517
01:18:46,287 --> 01:18:47,958
Oh.

1518
01:18:51,958 --> 01:18:52,959
Kay.

1519
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,029
Um, each other.

1520
01:18:56,029 --> 01:18:58,297
What?

1521
01:18:58,298 --> 01:18:59,666
What do a serial datist,

1522
01:18:59,667 --> 01:19:03,170
and a serial monogamist
have in common?

1523
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:04,838
Each other.

1524
01:19:13,079 --> 01:19:14,947
* oh, oh, oh, oh *

1525
01:19:14,948 --> 01:19:17,082
* oh, oh, oh, oh *

1526
01:19:17,083 --> 01:19:19,318

* oh, oh, oh, oh *

1528
01:19:21,255 --> 01:19:23,657
* Let's run away together *

1529
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:25,892
* You drive until you're tired *

1530
01:19:25,893 --> 01:19:27,894
* I'll sing
till you get better *

1531
01:19:27,895 --> 01:19:30,296
* You'll see
the stars in my eyes *

1532
01:19:30,297 --> 01:19:32,398
* You'll bring
your favorite sweater *

1533
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:34,084
* I'll bring my tambourine *

1534
01:19:35,002 --> 01:19:37,069
* Our songs can last forever *

1535
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:40,072
* It's like a movie scene *

1536
01:19:40,073 --> 01:19:44,810
* Let's not stop
until we reach the stars *

1537
01:19:44,811 --> 01:19:48,915
* If I'm with you
then nowhere seems too far *

1538
01:19:48,916 --> 01:19:53,420
* I feel the distance
and it's calling me *

1539
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:57,189
* Something about it
makes me believe *

1540
01:19:57,190 --> 01:19:59,225
* oh, oh, oh, oh *

1541
01:19:59,226 --> 01:20:01,561
* oh, oh, oh, oh *

1542
01:20:37,564 --> 01:20:39,499
* You make me wanna *

1543
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,067
* Make me wanna rub it good *

1544
01:20:41,068 --> 01:20:43,169
* I ain't tryin'

1545
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:45,738

01:20:55,315 --> 01:20:58,885

1550
01:20:58,886 --> 01:21:02,756
