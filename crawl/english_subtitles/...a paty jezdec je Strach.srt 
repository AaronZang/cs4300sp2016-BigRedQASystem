Yes, now I go to Monsieur Tony.

00:16:20,744 --> 00:16:22,744
Wasn't that the phone?

54
00:16:24,745 --> 00:16:27,911

That's lovely.

No, not today.
Tomorrow.

60
00:17:10,914 --> 00:17:13,529
As usual.
Bye-bye.

61
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:18,257
I've noticed a number of times.

62
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:20,960
I hung around last time,
just to make sure.

63
00:17:21,143 --> 00:17:23,024
She doesn't wear a brassiere.

64
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:26,917
Mrs. Kratochvilova,
what is this here?

65
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:29,281
What if there was a house search?

66
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,439
I'm the Civil Defence Warden.
I'm responsible for everything.

67
00:17:32,506 --> 00:17:34,273
Where am I to put them, then?

68
00:17:34,457 --> 00:17:37,302
You and your regulations!

69
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:40,417
Where am I to keep the rabbits?

70
00:17:40,508 --> 00:17:42,325
Soon there'll be nothing to eat.

71
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:45,216
Don't get excited, Mrs. Kratochvilova.

72
00:17:45,411 --> 00:17:46,558
Or they'll take
your blood pressure again!

73
00:17:46,925 --> 00:17:49,380
Don't get excited, Mrs. Kratochvilova!

74
00:17:49,506 --> 00:17:54,043
- Where am I to put them?
- I don't know, but I'll help you.

75
00:17:54,137 --> 00:17:59,257
- What am I supposed to do with them?
- Above all, don't forget the sand.

76
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:00,840
The sand!

77
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:05,357
Tomorrow, tomorrow, Mr. Fanta.
Tomorrow we'll do it.

78
00:18:06,531 --> 00:18:08,711
Good morning!

79
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:19,316
He can go to hell, Master John.

80
00:18:19,454 --> 00:18:21,129
Yeah!

81
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,993
Hey there, Mister.

82
00:19:44,223 --> 00:19:45,301
What's wrong?

83
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:47,871
Mister?

84
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:04,371
44-8-11. Hello?

85
00:20:05,128 --> 00:20:08,776
44-8-11. Hello?

86
00:20:39,816 --> 00:20:41,812
Stop playing with that hat.

87
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,953
We were so happy to see each other again.

88
00:21:21,068 --> 00:21:24,418
He's my cousin,
a gamekeeper, you know.

89
00:21:24,693 --> 00:21:26,671
He had his gun,
and we started fooling with it.

90
00:21:26,672 --> 00:21:27,672
I'm sorry.

91
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:31,609
I'm not a surgeon.

92
00:21:32,068 --> 00:21:35,143
And besides, I'm not allowed
to practice medicine.

93
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:40,408
I'm outside the law now.

94
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,277
That's just why...

95
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,088
I thought, being in the house,

96
00:21:44,311 --> 00:21:46,179
you could practice some first aid.

97
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,259
I know you might not believe me.

98
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,491
But it's such bad luck, this cousin...

99
00:21:50,671 --> 00:21:54,066
You expected me to believe such nonsense?

100
00:22:06,987 --> 00:22:09,029
Unfortunately, I don't...

101
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:11,002
really feel up to it.

102
00:22:12,781 --> 00:22:16,314
You know, I'm a sort of
warehouseman now.

103
00:22:17,593 --> 00:22:20,048
Isn't there someone else?

104
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:11,285
Vera, come here.

105
00:23:11,485 --> 00:23:14,124
- You must get rid of it.
- I have to feed him now.

106
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:17,519
I don't know why
we have to do everything.

107
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:19,332
Get going.

108
00:23:21,829 --> 00:23:23,871
Get going, you hear?

109
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:25,638
Not afraid, are you?

110
00:23:58,953 --> 00:24:01,248
What are you staring at?

111
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,329
My hands are trembling.

112
00:24:03,513 --> 00:24:04,821
Trembling, my hands...

113
00:24:04,981 --> 00:24:06,312
Trembling, my hands...

114
00:24:06,381 --> 00:24:07,941
Trembling.

115
00:24:18,006 --> 00:24:19,085
Gauze!

116
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:06,280
You must hold him down.

117
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:57,164
- It didn't bother you, Mr...
- Sidlak. I'm used to it.

118
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,384
- What's your job?
- Butcher at the slaughterhouse.

119
00:26:08,545 --> 00:26:11,596
Then you've had better practice than me.

120
00:26:12,893 --> 00:26:15,577
I did mostly laboratory work.

121
00:26:17,545 --> 00:26:19,059
He'll shout.

122
00:26:19,426 --> 00:26:21,629
He'll need morphine.

123
00:26:25,452 --> 00:26:27,242
But I have none.

124
00:26:29,261 --> 00:26:29,939
He'll shout!

125
00:26:30,003 --> 00:26:35,665
I know you've done a lot,
but couldn't you...

126
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,115
- How old is he?
- 27. Why?

127
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:42,419
- Nothing.
- A lot depends on him, Doctor.

128
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:45,086
I was never interested in politics.

129
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:48,757
But, Doctor, someone's got to do it.

130
00:26:52,336 --> 00:26:55,260
- You want to leave him here?
- Well, I don't have...

131
00:26:55,466 --> 00:26:59,036
But you can't!
He must get some morphine.

132
00:26:59,427 --> 00:27:01,881
You couldn't get it somehow, Doctor?

133
00:27:01,961 --> 00:27:05,138
Don't even think it.
I can't, no.

134
00:27:05,402 --> 00:27:07,249
I want nothing more to do with it.

135
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:09,188
I know it was a great risk for you.

136
00:27:09,372 --> 00:27:12,584
I've done all I could.
You can't ask any more of me.

137
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,937
I've already told you.
I am outside the law.

138
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,192
So is he.

139
00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:31,107
You won't find morphine anywhere today.

140
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,976
And I can't. I can't.

141
00:27:34,274 --> 00:27:36,224
No, no. I can't.

142
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:47,160
Yes, Ma'am, Friday at two.
Goodbye.

143
00:27:54,723 --> 00:27:58,624
Goodbye, Honzicek.
Goodbye, Anicka.

144
00:28:00,023 --> 00:28:02,974
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Goodbye.

145
00:28:10,346 --> 00:28:12,411
Anicka?

146
00:28:17,768 --> 00:28:19,833
- Alright?
- Yes, Doctor.

147
00:28:20,005 --> 00:28:21,588
Marta!

148
00:28:32,742 --> 00:28:34,463
Doctor Vesely.

149
00:28:34,616 --> 00:28:37,078
Yes, hello.

150
00:28:37,422 --> 00:28:39,006
Yes, thank you.

151
00:28:39,487 --> 00:28:41,713
Friday at seven.

152
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:45,684
Next Friday?
No, this Friday.

153
00:28:46,297 --> 00:28:47,445
Good.

154
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:50,351
Yes. Very much.

155
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,055
Right. Goodbye.

156
00:28:55,933 --> 00:28:58,250
Marta, Dostal called.

157
00:28:59,328 --> 00:29:01,141
Friday at seven.

158
00:29:03,183 --> 00:29:06,923
Daddy, who's a real hero?

159
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,393
A man who dies unnecessarily,

160
00:29:09,394 --> 00:29:12,870
as opposed to those
who live unnecessarily.

161
00:29:15,107 --> 00:29:16,713
Anicka! Come here.

162
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:19,077
Why should I look for it?

163
00:29:19,306 --> 00:29:21,509
What do I need morphine for?

164
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:23,342
After all, I'm a warehouseman.

165
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:25,563
And I did my duty.

166
00:29:25,939 --> 00:29:27,659
Or no, that's nonsense.

167
00:29:28,371 --> 00:29:30,321
What duty, exactly?

168
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:31,800
Whose?

169
00:29:32,082 --> 00:29:34,170
A doctor's, or a warehouseman's?

170
00:29:34,354 --> 00:29:36,717
Nothing makes sense now.

171
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,248
But I can't think differently.

172
00:29:43,251 --> 00:29:44,387
I can...

173
00:29:44,685 --> 00:29:47,117
do other things,
sweep streets, maybe.

174
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:49,887
But not think like somebody else, no.

175
00:29:53,065 --> 00:29:55,864
I simply cannot stop thinking.

176
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,612
You'll always find somebody
who doesn't think at all.

177
00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:06,734
And so he wants to think for the rest
and decide everything for them.

178
00:30:08,969 --> 00:30:11,998
Life, death... simple, clear.

179
00:30:16,474 --> 00:30:18,618
Death's a trifle,

180
00:30:19,446 --> 00:30:20,960
unless it should happen to be

181
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:22,963
my own.

182
00:30:23,262 --> 00:30:24,799
It doesn't even hurt.

183
00:30:25,974 --> 00:30:27,993
No one is screaming.

184
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:31,389
And if there were?
Nobody would hear him.

185
00:30:31,641 --> 00:30:33,545
From the start he's completely alone,

186
00:30:33,683 --> 00:30:35,541
transplanted, marked.

187
00:30:35,782 --> 00:30:38,146
It's really an act of mercy.

188
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:41,106
Look, you turned out
wrong somehow.

189
00:30:41,695 --> 00:30:43,481
I don't like you.

190
00:30:45,773 --> 00:30:48,802
You've got such a...
such a strange nose.

191
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,907
But... so it won't be

192
00:30:54,045 --> 00:30:57,418
too complicated,
and cause you trouble,

193
00:30:58,324 --> 00:31:01,811
I've made a dividing line,

194
00:31:02,936 --> 00:31:04,634
a nice, simple one...

195
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,869
It's just bad luck

196
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,324
that you're on the wrong side.

197
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:13,068
You know?

198
00:31:13,274 --> 00:31:15,523
Yes, I know, I know, gentlemen.

199
00:31:15,729 --> 00:31:18,574
But I also know that such injustice,

200
00:31:19,343 --> 00:31:23,611
hatred and apathy will
always come to light.

201
00:31:24,035 --> 00:31:27,012
Historically, I'm an optimist...

202
00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:33,712
but no longer for myself.

203
00:31:34,498 --> 00:31:36,985
They haven't shot me in the back, no.

204
00:31:36,986 --> 00:31:38,330
But it's much worse.

205
00:31:38,691 --> 00:31:43,716
For they've left me my brain,
which has just been considering

206
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:46,827
some notion of duty
as to whether or not

207
00:31:47,011 --> 00:31:50,063
I should try and get morphine
for God knows whom.

208
00:31:51,487 --> 00:31:54,033
Me. Me, precisely.

209
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:57,521
But that's absurd, isn't it?

210
00:31:57,911 --> 00:31:59,838
Why me?

211
00:32:00,033 --> 00:32:03,314
But why, why?

212
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,609
But why?

213
00:34:06,361 --> 00:34:08,816
Do the Wieners live here?

214
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,715
Helena!

215
00:34:14,082 --> 00:34:16,996
A visitor to see you.

216
00:34:24,514 --> 00:34:26,579
I can't stand it.

217
00:34:31,512 --> 00:34:33,485
I can't stand it anymore.

218
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,058
I can't stand it.

219
00:34:58,884 --> 00:35:00,880
Silence...

220
00:35:03,725 --> 00:35:06,134
This is silence...

221
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:09,451
Braun!

222
00:35:10,621 --> 00:35:13,099
I can't stand silence anymore.

223
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,427
I can't stand it.

224
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,282
Can't stand it.

225
00:35:23,007 --> 00:35:25,233
I can't, can't stand it.

226
00:35:28,261 --> 00:35:30,120
Well, goodbye.

227
00:35:38,121 --> 00:35:39,121
Hello.

228
00:35:42,122 --> 00:35:45,122
Hello, Braun.

229
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,960
I'm glad I've found you at last,
Dr Wiener.

230
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:26,517
I hope I'm not intruding.

231
00:37:26,654 --> 00:37:28,123
Sit down.

232
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:31,127
Thank you.

233
00:37:38,387 --> 00:37:41,347
- Well, what d'you need, Braun?
- Morphine.

234
00:37:41,645 --> 00:37:44,192
- I need some morphine.
- I see.

235
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:47,462
That's excellent.

236
00:37:47,668 --> 00:37:50,917
I'm afraid you didn't quite understand.

237
00:37:51,123 --> 00:37:53,336
It's nothing difficult to understand.

238
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:58,855
Every one of us sitting here,
what else do we need but morphine?

239
00:37:59,107 --> 00:38:02,388
I meant something quite different.

240
00:38:02,841 --> 00:38:04,641
- You see, he's in great pain.
- Got none.

241
00:38:05,979 --> 00:38:09,008
Sorry, a case of
cancer in the family.

242
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,674
Excuse me for a moment.

243
00:38:59,814 --> 00:39:01,535
Thank you.

244
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:05,063
- Thank you.
- Have you known Emil long?

245
00:39:05,258 --> 00:39:07,598
Yes.

246
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:11,207
10 or 15 years.

247
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,940
He was...

248
00:39:24,052 --> 00:39:26,829
He is a fine person.

249
00:40:00,754 --> 00:40:03,186
It's pleasant here.

250
00:40:06,605 --> 00:40:10,230
Vltava, Vltava.

251
00:40:12,705 --> 00:40:20,139
Deep waters say.

252
00:40:20,389 --> 00:40:25,718
What will the waters bring?

253
00:40:27,646 --> 00:40:32,808
What will they take away?

254
00:40:34,762 --> 00:40:42,678
How often will night follow day?

255
00:40:46,078 --> 00:40:47,914
Terribly stupid.

256
00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:09,063
Terribly stupid.

257
00:41:14,832 --> 00:41:17,356
I'll have some coffee, please.

258
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:19,868
I'm not used to drinking.

259
00:41:20,075 --> 00:41:23,127
- My head's spinning a bit.
- Freddie, a coffee!

260
00:41:24,171 --> 00:41:27,429
As I said,
sorry I can't help you.

261
00:41:27,956 --> 00:41:30,801
Those who have it
are glad to keep it.

262
00:41:31,891 --> 00:41:34,392
- I must get some.
- Someone in the family?

263
00:41:35,465 --> 00:41:39,664
Please, Doctor.
It's really an urgent case.

264
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:43,329
Medicine no longer interests me.

265
00:41:43,944 --> 00:41:46,009
Philanthropy still less.

266
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,776
The shot wound is...

267
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:52,112
in a... very sensitive place.

268
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:56,185
He needs to be kept quiet.

269
00:41:57,195 --> 00:41:59,191
Are you crazy?
Listen, man...

270
00:41:59,592 --> 00:42:02,621
Sorry, but... how can you?

271
00:42:06,742 --> 00:42:09,426
Two hours ago...

272
00:42:10,298 --> 00:42:11,950
I operated...

273
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,139
on a sofa.

274
00:42:17,752 --> 00:42:21,745
- First time in thirty years.
- But why... and with your asthma?

275
00:42:33,992 --> 00:42:36,499
Try at our hospital.

276
00:42:36,998 --> 00:42:40,554
It's for the chief, Ruzicka.
He's a friend.

277
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:44,472
Thank you.
I knew you'd help.

278
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:46,629
Wait, Braun,
let's have a cognac.

279
00:42:46,743 --> 00:42:49,772
- I really can't. I must hurry.
- Freddie, two cognacs.

280
00:42:50,311 --> 00:42:52,394
- Three.
- No, really, I don't want to.

281
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,593
It'll be here in a minute.

282
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:59,042
I wanted to ask, is there
anything I can do for you?

283
00:43:03,627 --> 00:43:06,655
You were at my house, Braun,

284
00:43:07,183 --> 00:43:09,328
and you saw Helena?

285
00:43:09,512 --> 00:43:12,701
- I know, it's terrible.
- You know nothing!

286
00:43:13,871 --> 00:43:16,567
It's more terrible
than you can imagine.

287
00:43:16,728 --> 00:43:19,642
- You're afraid she'll try it again?
- I am, I am.

288
00:43:20,124 --> 00:43:22,877
And just as afraid she won't succeed.

289
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:30,356
Hate is contagious.

290
00:43:30,575 --> 00:43:35,315
More so than the plague.
And spreads by chain reaction.

291
00:43:35,382 --> 00:43:37,722
New regulations have just come out!

292
00:43:38,596 --> 00:43:40,982
New regulations!

293
00:43:42,021 --> 00:43:44,086
New regulations!

294
00:43:50,774 --> 00:43:53,137
New regulations.

295
00:43:53,596 --> 00:43:56,143
New regulations.

296
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:52,958
Obligatory.

297
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,100
No... no... no...

298
00:46:04,301 --> 00:46:06,600
No! No!

299
00:46:16,264 --> 00:46:18,944
...one and one is one...

300
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:22,623
...one and one is... two...

301
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:27,236
But pretend it's nothing,
and get up,

302
00:46:27,237 --> 00:46:29,991
and live through two minutes of fear...

303
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:34,305
live through two minutes of fear...

304
00:46:34,534 --> 00:46:38,091
Pascal, the nations aren't listening.

305
00:46:38,402 --> 00:46:41,546
They didn't assemble, see?

306
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:44,391
Have you had your pills?

307
00:46:53,824 --> 00:46:57,243
Looking for someone?

308
00:46:58,206 --> 00:46:59,973
I'm looking for...

309
00:47:00,581 --> 00:47:02,950
Head Physician Ruzicka.

310
00:47:04,522 --> 00:47:09,156
I must... I must speak
with Doctor Ruzicka.

311
00:47:10,045 --> 00:47:12,087
With Doctor Ruzicka?

312
00:47:12,345 --> 00:47:15,006
Well, sit down then.

313
00:47:43,699 --> 00:47:46,728
- Who are you looking for?
- Morphine.

314
00:47:48,494 --> 00:47:50,858
And who are you?

315
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,164
Doctor Braun.

316
00:47:53,691 --> 00:47:55,550
What do you want?

317
00:47:56,072 --> 00:47:58,137
Morphine.

318
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:01,292
For whom?

319
00:48:04,297 --> 00:48:08,531
- For a man in our house.
- Put him in Number 3..

320
00:48:09,058 --> 00:48:12,454
- What Number 3?
- No, first to my office.

321
00:48:12,741 --> 00:48:15,609
And what man do you want it for?

322
00:48:19,154 --> 00:48:22,177
- Someone who can't get to a doctor.
- I'm not surprised.

323
00:48:22,292 --> 00:48:26,238
- Excuse me, I'm feeling sick.
- You'll be alright with us.

324
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:35,039
Away! Get away!

325
00:48:38,845 --> 00:48:40,933
Neutron kills!

326
00:49:03,017 --> 00:49:04,852
So you're Doctor Braun?

327
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,586
And you need morphine?

328
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:11,477
For a man in your house?

329
00:49:11,678 --> 00:49:15,373
- Who can't get to a doctor?
- I need morphine, yes.

330
00:49:19,572 --> 00:49:22,302
What is your real name?

331
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:27,510
Excuse me, I forgot.

332
00:49:27,946 --> 00:49:31,262
Dr Wiener sent me to you.

333
00:49:33,281 --> 00:49:36,837
Excuse me,
I'm not used to alcohol.

334
00:49:40,838 --> 00:49:42,138
I'm not well.

335
00:50:10,023 --> 00:50:11,813
Excuse me, Doctor.

336
00:50:12,154 --> 00:50:14,245
We once worked
on medical problems together.

337
00:50:14,383 --> 00:50:16,241
What do you need?

338
00:50:17,997 --> 00:50:20,268
Two vials of morphine.

339
00:50:26,769 --> 00:50:29,637
That's absurd, Doctor.

340
00:50:30,532 --> 00:50:34,777
We have up to twenty suicides a day.

341
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:38,234
Most of them we save.

342
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:42,055
And you need two vials of morphine.

343
00:50:43,558 --> 00:50:45,439
Here they are.

344
00:50:57,651 --> 00:51:01,130
Our nation is fighting its way
towards the light.

345
00:51:01,527 --> 00:51:05,953
We hope this will be a year
of victory and peace.

346
00:51:06,935 --> 00:51:13,219
We all know that great sacrifices
will be required of everyone.

347
00:51:14,748 --> 00:51:17,086
For without sacrifice, there is no success.

348
00:51:17,464 --> 00:51:22,632
And without courageous effort and
unselfish devotion, there is no victory.

349
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:27,784
Without endurance and discipline,

350
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:30,133
no battle is ever won.

351
00:51:31,134 --> 00:51:35,323
Therefore, let us close our ranks
even more firmly.

352
00:51:35,454 --> 00:51:38,901
United in will and action,
steeled in sacrifices and deeds,

353
00:51:39,114 --> 00:51:42,286
we shall faithfully follow

354
00:51:43,413 --> 00:51:46,017
our beloved leader...

355
00:52:01,092 --> 00:52:03,021
Oh, Doctor, it's you.

356
00:52:03,305 --> 00:52:06,146
Why don't you turn on the light?

357
00:52:06,406 --> 00:52:07,897
Wait, I'll do it.

358
00:52:07,898 --> 00:52:10,898
Terrible stairs these, someone will
kill themselves one day.

359
00:52:11,009 --> 00:52:15,104
- I can see quite well, thank you.
- I know, I fell once myself...

360
00:52:18,937 --> 00:52:21,375
What's going on?

361
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:24,357
Come back here.
Come right back!

362
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:37,808
Quiet! Please, be quiet!

363
00:52:40,045 --> 00:52:41,406
It's after ten o'clock!

364
00:52:44,608 --> 00:52:47,654
- There are regulations.
- Leave me alone!

365
00:52:47,879 --> 00:52:51,051
Woman, nobody realizes
I'm responsible for everything.

366
00:52:51,453 --> 00:52:54,128
For everything, I tell you.

367
00:52:55,063 --> 00:52:58,518
Come on, quick,
you little monster.

368
00:53:08,195 --> 00:53:09,822
I warn you, Madame,
this is the last time.

369
00:53:10,349 --> 00:53:12,189
It's after ten o'clock.
I won't have it.

370
00:53:12,214 --> 00:53:14,454
I simply won't have it.

371
00:53:14,555 --> 00:53:16,855
There must be absolute quiet here!

372
00:53:20,775 --> 00:53:23,828
...and without courageous effort
and unselfish devotion,

373
00:53:23,947 --> 00:53:25,284
there can be no victory.

374
00:53:25,426 --> 00:53:29,604
Forever gabbing about victory,
it drives you crazy.

375
00:53:30,355 --> 00:53:33,201
Everything's different now,
my boy.

376
00:53:33,464 --> 00:53:35,454
Be glad you don't know.

377
00:53:35,455 --> 00:53:38,482
Everything's different now, my boy.

378
00:53:38,718 --> 00:53:41,369
Be glad you don't know old age.

379
00:53:41,804 --> 00:53:44,876
When your legs ache,
you can't catch your breath.

380
00:53:45,633 --> 00:53:48,639
Everyone thinks
he can shout at me.

381
00:53:48,947 --> 00:53:50,911
Now we only shout at each other.

382
00:53:51,106 --> 00:53:53,781
And we kill.
All Europe's gone mad.

383
00:53:53,923 --> 00:53:57,236
It's not your Europe any more.

384
00:53:57,579 --> 00:53:59,564
Be glad you don't know.

385
00:53:59,565 --> 00:54:01,082
Yeah, dying - that's easy!

386
00:54:18,496 --> 00:54:21,005
Where do the stairs lead to?

387
00:54:21,242 --> 00:54:23,656
Where do the stairs lead to?

388
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:25,952
To the cellar!

389
00:54:27,408 --> 00:54:29,893
Search the cellar.

390
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,044
Why didn't I say something?

391
00:54:33,988 --> 00:54:36,437
Because Dr. Braun came strolling along.

392
00:54:38,838 --> 00:54:42,138
Poor old Braun.
But no, Braun wasn't there.

393
00:54:43,133 --> 00:54:48,360
He wasn't. Old Braun's not allowed
to be out so late at night.

394
00:54:49,021 --> 00:54:53,180
He must have gone to see someone
in the house. That's strange.

395
00:54:53,908 --> 00:54:55,894
And he was strange, too.

396
00:54:58,825 --> 00:55:01,618
Do you know where Dr Braun
was going?

397
00:55:02,224 --> 00:55:04,260
But I won't leave it at this.

398
00:55:04,478 --> 00:55:08,431
He has no right to shout at me,
that fellow!

399
00:55:08,896 --> 00:55:13,227
If I don't sleep,
he won't sleep either.

400
00:55:13,542 --> 00:55:15,790
He has no right to shout at me!

401
00:55:15,949 --> 00:55:19,452
If I don't sleep,
he won't sleep either...

402
00:55:21,499 --> 00:55:24,978
Tomorrow I'll put it right,
or even today.

403
00:55:25,167 --> 00:55:28,078
But ask him what's in
the packages he gets.

404
00:55:28,238 --> 00:55:29,800
Only don't say I told you so.

405
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:31,601
Shut her up, please.

406
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:36,650
It's you, Doctor.

407
00:55:36,963 --> 00:55:38,904
Who on earth is that man?

408
00:55:38,975 --> 00:55:42,147
- What should I do?
- The police are here.

409
00:55:42,354 --> 00:55:44,768
- You must keep them back.
- The police?

410
00:55:54,635 --> 00:55:57,735
- Going somewhere, Karel?
- No.

411
00:56:00,579 --> 00:56:04,864
Go to bed. I was only checking
whether I'd shut the door.

412
00:56:38,837 --> 00:56:41,890
I haven't seen you,
and I know nothing.

413
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:45,506
You have my word,
but that's all.

414
00:56:45,671 --> 00:56:48,373
You need something?
A tranquilizer?

415
00:56:49,556 --> 00:56:52,302
I have everything.
Eunalgit, Papaverine.

416
00:56:52,515 --> 00:56:55,237
Morphine.
What do you need?

417
00:57:00,303 --> 00:57:02,836
You have morphine?

418
00:57:50,524 --> 00:57:53,577
- When does you husband go on night shift?
- Nine o'clock.

419
00:57:53,684 --> 00:57:56,808
- When did he leave tonight?
- Nine o'clock.

420
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,944
And you've been at home alone since then?

421
00:57:59,181 --> 00:58:01,642
I'm nearly always alone.

422
00:58:22,056 --> 00:58:25,038
Order a search of the whole house.

423
00:58:27,867 --> 00:58:29,737
It's being carried out.

424
00:58:34,198 --> 00:58:37,630
In the cabinet was Eunalgit,
morphine and Papaverine.

425
00:58:40,056 --> 00:58:42,139
You play golf, Dr Vesely?

426
00:58:42,281 --> 00:58:45,382
Yes, but there's not much
opportunity lately.

427
00:58:46,554 --> 00:58:48,472
- Where do you go?
- Usually to...

428
00:58:49,937 --> 00:58:53,440
Usually to Klanovice.

429
00:58:54,316 --> 00:58:57,204
The manufacturer Mach
used to go there.

430
00:58:57,452 --> 00:59:01,316
- Know him?
- He was my uncle, Mr. Commissar.

431
00:59:01,884 --> 00:59:06,215
I knew his wife, my client.

432
00:59:06,873 --> 00:59:09,064
A highly interesting woman.

433
00:59:09,065 --> 00:59:11,874
I got her divorce for her.

434
00:59:14,803 --> 00:59:16,512
When did they get divorced?

435
00:59:56,773 --> 00:59:58,832
Excuse me.

436
01:00:14,115 --> 01:00:17,239
Our son, Mr. Commissar.

437
01:00:29,098 --> 01:00:31,323
You take things very calmly, Doctor.

438
01:00:31,476 --> 01:00:32,967
You are doing your duty,

439
01:00:33,109 --> 01:00:36,139
and I won't be the one to tidy it up.

440
01:00:44,706 --> 01:00:47,133
A little late for a night concert.

441
01:00:47,234 --> 01:00:49,345
She does it often,
an old music teacher.

442
01:00:49,842 --> 01:00:51,641
And a little crazy.

443
01:01:23,024 --> 01:01:27,988
Fanta, Vlastimil Fanta.
Civil Defence warden here.

444
01:01:28,367 --> 01:01:30,752
Otherwise head of the
Labor Force Department.

445
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,353
Fanta, Vlastimil Fanta.
Civil Defence warden here.

446
01:01:40,554 --> 01:01:43,354
Otherwise department head
at the Labor Office.

447
01:02:27,584 --> 01:02:29,644
- Single?
- Yes, single.

448
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:34,649
- Name? - Vlastimil Fanta.
Civil Defence warden here.

449
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:39,004
- Otherwise head of...
- Head clerk at the Labor Office.

450
01:02:39,205 --> 01:02:42,779
Yes, but completely at your disposal.

451
01:02:46,578 --> 01:02:50,862
- You've read all this.
- Yes, I read every day.

452
01:02:53,048 --> 01:02:56,385
- You're not from Prague?
- No from Pecky.

453
01:02:58,823 --> 01:03:02,101
And the packages you get,
also from there?

454
01:03:02,243 --> 01:03:04,769
Yes, I send my mother my dirty linen,

455
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:07,568
and she returns it clean,
each fortnight.

456
01:03:07,728 --> 01:03:11,539
I've got a clean shirt on.
If you wish, I would...

457
01:03:14,568 --> 01:03:16,225
No, you needn't.

458
01:03:17,089 --> 01:03:18,695
We believe you, Mr. Fanta.

459
01:03:21,096 --> 01:03:22,096
Thank you, thank you.

460
01:03:22,474 --> 01:03:25,858
Greet your mother for me, in Pecky.

461
01:03:26,852 --> 01:03:28,344
I will.

462
01:03:34,091 --> 01:03:35,937
- Where to?
- To open the door.

463
01:03:36,056 --> 01:03:38,517
No, we'll do it ourselves.

464
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:15,139
You play the violin?

465
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,140
Give him the violin.

466
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:25,248
Play us something now, Braun.

467
01:04:26,473 --> 01:04:28,603
As a treat.

468
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:40,472
Something...

469
01:04:42,176 --> 01:04:44,211
you are fond of.

470
01:05:26,046 --> 01:05:27,277
That's enough!

471
01:05:27,513 --> 01:05:28,910
Search the place.

472
01:05:52,309 --> 01:05:54,368
You were lucky.

473
01:05:54,758 --> 01:05:56,078
We can go now.

474
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:05,104
Sleep well, my dear man.

475
01:06:40,853 --> 01:06:43,835
I made a mistake...
A mistake.

476
01:06:45,025 --> 01:06:46,818
I should have waited on the stairs.

477
01:06:50,161 --> 01:06:51,723
Fanta saw me.

478
01:07:05,157 --> 01:07:09,772
We hope this will be a year
of victory and peace.

479
01:07:10,269 --> 01:07:17,399
We all know that great sacrifices
will be required of everyone.

480
01:07:18,394 --> 01:07:22,749
For without sacrifice, there is no success.

481
01:07:22,962 --> 01:07:26,607
And without courageous effort and
unselfish devotion, there is no victory.

482
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:33,201
Without endurance and discipline,
no battle is ever won.

483
01:07:34,202 --> 01:07:39,202
Therefore, let us close
our ranks even more firmly...

484
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:18,160
...we shall faithfully follow
our beloved leader,

485
01:08:18,161 --> 01:08:22,125
and devote our efforts
and make it our honour

486
01:08:22,126 --> 01:08:25,661
to be loyal to his commands,
and to do our very best.

487
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:46,095
Where am I to serve the breakfast, Sir?

488
01:08:48,705 --> 01:08:49,821
I'm not having any today.

489
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:31,287
- Doctor Vesely.
- That's just wonderful.

490
01:09:31,453 --> 01:09:34,743
Dear Dr Vesely's at home,
and I'm waiting.

491
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:36,335
That's you, is it?

492
01:09:36,477 --> 01:09:40,276
Yes, me, who else could it be?
Is someone else there?

493
01:09:40,524 --> 01:09:42,607
Nobody, you know that.

494
01:09:42,726 --> 01:09:46,087
What are you doing?
I'm waiting here for so long.

495
01:09:46,678 --> 01:09:48,951
I know, excuse me.
I wanted to...

496
01:09:49,282 --> 01:09:52,004
Wanted, wanted...
Why didn't you call?

497
01:09:52,075 --> 01:09:53,708
Hello? Has anything happened?

498
01:09:54,246 --> 01:09:57,039
Hello, hello? Are you there?

499
01:09:57,662 --> 01:10:00,194
Karel, why don't you answer?

500
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,825
What's the matter?

501
01:10:04,426 --> 01:10:06,026
She's there, isn't she?

502
01:10:06,827 --> 01:10:08,444
You're strange...

503
01:10:09,645 --> 01:10:10,727
Well, what's the matter?

504
01:10:17,127 --> 01:10:20,038
- I'm afraid now.
- Afraid?

505
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:24,092
Afraid for me?
I've had such a terrible night.

506
01:10:24,305 --> 01:10:26,316
But it's day now.

507
01:10:26,529 --> 01:10:29,195
Day? Yes, that's right.

508
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:33,597
Yes, it's day now.

509
01:10:34,142 --> 01:10:36,806
- Everything looks better.
- When are you coming?

510
01:10:37,682 --> 01:10:40,711
In an hour or so.
I'll have a bath...

511
01:10:41,656 --> 01:10:44,923
Only, darling, there's one little thing.

512
01:10:45,525 --> 01:10:48,010
Leninka is back in debt again.

513
01:10:48,136 --> 01:10:50,716
- Oh dear, how much?
- Five.

514
01:10:51,396 --> 01:10:53,574
Five, I don't have. Three.

515
01:10:53,686 --> 01:10:56,053
You're angry, darling.

516
01:10:56,266 --> 01:10:59,532
This is the last time, really.

517
01:10:59,668 --> 01:11:03,550
And in return I'll do
everything you like.

518
01:11:04,866 --> 01:11:08,487
Alright. In an hour.

519
01:13:47,145 --> 01:13:50,656
- Mr. Fanta's here to speak to you.
- What's the trouble?

520
01:13:50,987 --> 01:13:53,525
- I don't know.
- Alright. Send him in.

521
01:13:54,026 --> 01:13:55,390
- In here?
- Yes, in here.

522
01:13:57,603 --> 01:14:01,082
Mr. Fanta, you're to go in.

523
01:14:10,371 --> 01:14:13,188
Excuse me, sorry to disturb you.

524
01:14:13,276 --> 01:14:14,312
But the situation is extremely grave.

525
01:14:14,708 --> 01:14:16,796
Good morning, Mr. Fanta.

526
01:14:16,897 --> 01:14:19,917
Serious matters are best solved
in bed or bath.

527
01:14:20,195 --> 01:14:22,596
But not on an empty stomach.

528
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,057
But the situation is extremely grave.

529
01:14:24,117 --> 01:14:25,963
Be good enough to hand me the towel.

530
01:14:27,505 --> 01:14:29,186
No, that one.

531
01:14:31,848 --> 01:14:35,825
- What's that supposed to be?
- Nothing degenerate, Mr. Fanta.

532
01:14:35,826 --> 01:14:36,826
My towel?

533
01:14:38,748 --> 01:14:40,878
The situation is extremely grave.

534
01:14:40,973 --> 01:14:43,996
You seem to have
said that once already.

535
01:14:44,091 --> 01:14:45,141
I saw him.

536
01:14:45,642 --> 01:14:47,239
Here in the house they're
harboring some suspicious element.

537
01:14:47,375 --> 01:14:50,570
I saw him with my own eyes,
being carried up the stairs.

538
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:54,522
- When the police were here.
- How strong are your lenses?

539
01:14:56,573 --> 01:14:57,709
8 1/2...

540
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:04,870
- I saw him!
- But I didn't, Mr. Fanta.

541
01:15:05,036 --> 01:15:08,521
I only agree with you that
last night was melodramatic.

542
01:15:08,663 --> 01:15:11,172
You evidently can't stand noise.

543
01:15:11,598 --> 01:15:15,713
- I warn you, doctor.
- You're threatening me, I know.

544
01:15:15,949 --> 01:15:19,547
And I warn you that
I'm in a hurry. Good day.

545
01:15:49,426 --> 01:15:51,437
You're an informer, Mr. Fanta.

546
01:15:51,438 --> 01:15:52,438
That's what I'll tell you.

547
01:15:52,974 --> 01:15:54,940
I'm waiting here for you.

548
01:15:55,053 --> 01:15:57,893
For me, you're an informer!

549
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:00,408
And I'll let the whole house hear it!

550
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:02,846
Mr. Fanta's an informer!

551
01:16:04,964 --> 01:16:06,029
Informer!

552
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,000
Informer!

553
01:16:07,118 --> 01:16:08,538
Informer!

554
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:53,642
Promptly and accurately
reporting information

555
01:16:53,855 --> 01:16:55,961
ensures your safety.

556
01:17:11,197 --> 01:17:14,960
44-8-11, speak.

557
01:17:49,653 --> 01:17:51,855
You're leaving, Sir?

558
01:17:56,497 --> 01:17:58,533
No, I'm not.

559
01:18:30,833 --> 01:18:31,959
It's stuffy.

560
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:35,850
What have you been doing,
children? What's the time?

561
01:18:37,069 --> 01:18:39,933
Is it that late?
I'd no idea.

562
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:02,886
So late.

563
01:19:19,744 --> 01:19:22,750
- Did he ask where I was?
- No, Ma'am, everything's alright.

564
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:26,034
Only the master's a little...

565
01:19:28,117 --> 01:19:29,939
Shut the door.

566
01:19:34,265 --> 01:19:36,020
Have you had your tea?

567
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:38,572
- Did they have their tea, Anicka?
- Yes.

568
01:19:38,998 --> 01:19:41,741
Just imagine, Karel,
all that trouble for nothing.

569
01:19:41,874 --> 01:19:44,865
The dressmaker's making
screws in a factory now.

570
01:19:45,055 --> 01:19:47,199
And the cleaner's was shut, too.
I don't know what it is today...

571
01:19:49,401 --> 01:19:50,511
I wanted to say...

572
01:19:51,422 --> 01:19:55,067
Ah, a man called.
What's his name... Zelezny.

573
01:19:56,901 --> 01:20:00,292
Zelezny... I know three.

574
01:20:01,604 --> 01:20:02,948
One's getting a divorce...

575
01:20:03,415 --> 01:20:06,326
Doctor Zelezny.
Did he call yet?

576
01:20:15,627 --> 01:20:16,827
He called.

577
01:20:18,828 --> 01:20:20,128
But not Zelezny.

578
01:20:29,673 --> 01:20:34,454
- Leave him, leave him.
- Let go, how dare you!

579
01:20:41,491 --> 01:20:43,952
You're a beast.

580
01:20:47,851 --> 01:20:50,337
And you're... a slut.

581
01:20:50,686 --> 01:20:51,727
You...

582
01:20:51,917 --> 01:20:54,899
You have the nerve to moralise!

583
01:20:55,008 --> 01:20:57,304
You think I'm so stupid
that I don't know anything?

584
01:20:57,635 --> 01:21:00,617
But I've seen through you, ages ago.

585
01:21:00,925 --> 01:21:02,842
I know you inside and out!

586
01:21:03,008 --> 01:21:04,097
Slut!

587
01:21:04,215 --> 01:21:08,002
You have no right to reproach me
for living as best I can.

588
01:21:08,208 --> 01:21:10,835
What do you think it's like
living with you?

589
01:21:11,031 --> 01:21:12,801
For God's sake, tell me,
what do you think it's like?

590
01:21:12,854 --> 01:21:16,499
Only I'm not nearly so bad as you,
I don't have to pay for anything!

591
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:19,900
But you! All you can do
anymore is pay, pay, pay!

592
01:21:19,901 --> 01:21:22,901
And you know what you're getting?
The worst kind of junk!

593
01:21:22,937 --> 01:21:24,435
All of Prague's laughing at you!

594
01:21:33,644 --> 01:21:35,443
And the worst of it is,

595
01:21:35,638 --> 01:21:38,951
your awful, grasping sister says

596
01:21:39,283 --> 01:21:41,709
me and that girl of yours
are like two peas in a pod.

597
01:21:41,803 --> 01:21:44,951
Dad are you going upstairs?
Mr. Sidlak...

598
01:21:57,033 --> 01:21:59,755
Who else is in the flat
besides yourself?

599
01:22:00,311 --> 01:22:04,053
My wife, my son and a maid.

600
01:22:04,156 --> 01:22:05,729
I must ask you all to go to the cellar.

601
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:08,020
An anonymous call. House search.

602
01:22:08,633 --> 01:22:10,278
You are the owner, right?

603
01:22:11,077 --> 01:22:14,769
...that great sacrifices
will be required of everyone.

604
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:18,100
For without sacrifice, there is no success.

605
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:23,544
And without courageous effort and
unselfish devotion, there is no victory.

606
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,545
Without endurance and discipline...

607
01:22:30,009 --> 01:22:35,181
I can't keep those rabbits
anywhere else! Mr. Commissar!

608
01:22:35,394 --> 01:22:39,891
Please let me go,
I can't help it.

609
01:22:40,903 --> 01:22:43,666
- I got them as a gift. Let me go!
- We'll wait.

610
01:22:44,471 --> 01:22:46,459
Bring me a chair.

611
01:22:49,779 --> 01:22:51,980
Keep a watch on Braun.

612
01:23:00,355 --> 01:23:03,250
...will encourage everyone
to do his duty,

613
01:23:05,729 --> 01:23:10,794
and crush anybody who avoids doing it.

614
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:30,795
... 497. Jan Mechura

615
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:34,196
534. Jaroslav Mechura

616
01:23:37,197 --> 01:23:39,797
952. Bozena Mechurova ...

617
01:24:24,722 --> 01:24:27,752
Dr. Vesely, I beg you.
Tell me why we're here?

618
01:24:27,823 --> 01:24:30,403
It's nothing.
No need to be upset.

619
01:24:30,509 --> 01:24:33,426
Then why are we all here
if it's nothing?

620
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:34,533
We're not all here.

621
01:24:42,462 --> 01:24:45,586
Dr. Braun is missing.

622
01:25:01,133 --> 01:25:03,594
I hate to ask you for a favour.

623
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,375
For myself, I only hope
they know how to shoot.

624
01:25:06,494 --> 01:25:09,547
But my wife and son knew nothing.
You understand?

625
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:12,884
And they'd not be ungrateful,
Mr. Fanta.

626
01:25:13,314 --> 01:25:17,337
I've nothing against you,
or anybody, I swear.

627
01:25:17,669 --> 01:25:20,935
I've nothing against anybody.

628
01:25:24,055 --> 01:25:25,548
Why are you all looking at me
like that?

629
01:25:27,463 --> 01:25:30,706
It was my duty.
They said it was our duty.

630
01:25:30,966 --> 01:25:34,091
And it's true.
Absolutely true!

631
01:25:37,061 --> 01:25:40,280
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!

632
01:25:49,064 --> 01:25:50,928
You've messed something up again!

633
01:25:50,929 --> 01:25:52,510
You have to ruin everything!
You're useless!

634
01:25:52,652 --> 01:25:55,208
It's not enough for you
that you've ruined my life.

635
01:25:55,457 --> 01:25:57,705
You married me,
young and ignorant,

636
01:25:57,942 --> 01:26:00,664
and thought I'd fall for your
stupid heroism. Nothing doing!

637
01:26:00,834 --> 01:26:04,005
You make me sick!
I hate you!

638
01:26:14,546 --> 01:26:17,150
Our Father who art in heaven...

639
01:26:17,789 --> 01:26:19,895
I don't want to die!

640
01:26:22,236 --> 01:26:25,691
...as we forgive...
How does it go next?

641
01:26:26,401 --> 01:26:29,100
...those that trespass against us.

642
01:26:39,798 --> 01:26:42,520
What is it, Ma'am,
what's happened?

643
01:26:45,465 --> 01:26:48,495
Promise him anything you like.
I promise you, too.

644
01:26:48,803 --> 01:26:50,288
You heard him,
he didn't betray us.

645
01:26:50,382 --> 01:26:54,004
He probably only informed on Doctor Braun.

646
01:26:54,193 --> 01:26:57,578
Karel, give him money,
any sum, so he won't talk.

647
01:26:57,684 --> 01:27:00,442
Let Braun take the blame.

648
01:27:00,631 --> 01:27:04,371
No matter what he's done,
he shouldn't have done it.

649
01:27:14,501 --> 01:27:15,424
Braun!

650
01:27:21,275 --> 01:27:24,352
We've been waiting only for you,
Doctor.

651
01:27:25,204 --> 01:27:27,122
Let's go upstairs.

652
01:27:27,382 --> 01:27:30,814
A little... confrontation.

653
01:27:46,388 --> 01:27:50,009
You won't find anybody there.
He left during the night.

654
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:57,010
I don't know where he's going.

655
01:27:57,919 --> 01:28:01,374
I found him in the street,
slightly wounded.

656
01:28:03,268 --> 01:28:05,919
I'm a doctor.

657
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:08,986
I was a doctor.

658
01:28:11,531 --> 01:28:12,690
No, actually...

659
01:28:14,182 --> 01:28:15,933
I still am.

660
01:28:16,661 --> 01:28:20,022
A man is as he thinks.

661
01:28:21,761 --> 01:28:24,247
You can't change that.

662
01:28:39,477 --> 01:28:41,537
Cyanide...

663
01:28:41,773 --> 01:28:44,045
Instant death.

664
01:28:59,112 --> 01:29:01,455
Lay him out on that box.

665
01:29:11,444 --> 01:29:15,018
The Reich will steadfastly
and victoriously overcome

666
01:29:15,373 --> 01:29:16,678
all the storms and dangers
of this time.

667
01:29:17,856 --> 01:29:23,739
With iron resolve and
unshakeable faith, our nation...

668
01:29:26,793 --> 01:29:31,117
We hope this will be a year
of victory and peace.

669
01:29:32,418 --> 01:29:39,698
We all know that great sacrifices
will be required of everyone.

670
01:29:40,435 --> 01:29:42,704
For without sacrifice, there is no success.

671
01:29:43,405 --> 01:29:48,505
And without courageous effort and
unselfish devotion, there is no victory.

672
01:29:48,768 --> 01:29:52,413
- We can go.
- And the people in the cellar?

673
01:29:57,490 --> 01:30:00,022
The people in the cellar...?

674
01:30:03,206 --> 01:30:04,721
Let them go.

675
01:30:06,793 --> 01:30:07,875
Take off his hat.

676
01:30:19,782 --> 01:30:21,487
I don't want to die!

677
01:30:55,870 --> 01:30:58,829
... and crush anybody

678
01:30:59,352 --> 01:31:02,003
who avoids doing his duty.

679
01:31:02,104 --> 01:31:10,604
We shall remain in this struggle until
the result is unequivocal victory.

680
01:31:46,466 --> 01:31:47,658
Halt!

681
01:31:52,499 --> 01:31:57,469
Who called 44-8-11
at 11:40 a.m. today?

682
01:31:59,547 --> 01:32:03,570
Therefore, let us close
our ranks even more firmly.

683
01:32:03,878 --> 01:32:06,008
United in will and action...

684
01:32:06,263 --> 01:32:08,204
You can go!

685
01:32:20,626 --> 01:32:23,774
Promptly and accurately
reporting information

686
01:32:23,869 --> 01:32:25,810
ensures your safety.

687
01:32:25,999 --> 01:32:28,153
Call 44-8-11.

688
01:33:58,766 --> 01:34:03,800
