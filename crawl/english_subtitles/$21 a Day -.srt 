2
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,796
Most people come to
southern California for the sunshine.

3
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,192
But there are others who burn easily,
so they stay in the shadows.

4
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,476
Anthony Braddock was one of them.

5
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,078
Tony Braddock
was a professional chemist.

6
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,118
He'd worked himself out of a career
with British intelligence

7
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,875
and into building bombs
for anyone who'd pay him.

8
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,590
Maybe he wasn't the kind of guy
you'd want your kids to grow up to be,

9
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,911
but one of his bombs
got me out of prison in Morocco.

10
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,640
So when he called early
on a quiet Sunday afternoon

11
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,430
and said he was in trouble,
I had to make good on my IOU.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,797
MacGyver?

13
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,758
Tony?

14
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,152
Where are you?

15
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,072
Right here.

16
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,870
I'm sorry for the fright, old man.

17
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,748
Had to make sure you were alone.

18
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,672
Yeah, I'm alone.

19
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,752
Pete Thornton wanted to come.
It wasn't easy keeping him away.

20
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,673
Peter, yes.

21
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,716
He always disapproved of me.

22
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,440
- A keen judge of character.
- Yeah.

23
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,988
According to the organization,
Braddock should be in this area.

24
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,720
Jules, check the warehouses here.

25
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,269
- And when I find him?
- You'II come and get me.

26
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,396
Braddock is mine.

27
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,548
Tara.

28
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,716
It's been a Iong time.

29
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,110
Guess you haven't changed.

30
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,878
How Iong you been
on the run, Tony?

31
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,077
Two weeks. From the West Coast
to the East Coast and back again.

32
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,468
I appreciate your coming.

33
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,831
I remember Morocco.

34
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,919
You saved my Iife.

35
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,234
Yes, a Iot of people
would have conveniently forgotten.

36
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,755
Have you ever heard of a man
with the code name Lancer?

37
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,435
No.

38
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,759
I wish I could say the same.

39
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,518
He hired me to do a job.

40
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,830
Naturally I assumed it was...

41
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,709
...Iegitimate scientific research.

42
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,154
Naturally.

43
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,959
Yeah, I seem to have run out.
You wouldn't happen to...?

44
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,758
No, of course not.

45
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,274
I found him.
But there's another guy with him.

46
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,192
He could be Braddock's contact.

47
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,716
If he is, it'II be the Iast contact
he ever makes.

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,230
You were talking
about a Iegitimate job.

49
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,710
At Lancer's behest
and for a Iarge sum of money,

50
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,032
I developed an explosive with a
remarkable stable molecular structure.

51
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,237
You can mould it Iike plastic
and weave it Iike cloth.

52
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,153
It's quite deadly.

53
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,596
It's my crowning achievement,
you might say.

54
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,796
What would Lancer want with it?

55
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,635
He's going to assassinate
some of the highest-ranking officers

56
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,792
in your country's elite
anti-terrorist brigade.

57
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,749
Omega Force?

58
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,549
None other.

59
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,152
One explosion.

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,752
Quite effective.

61
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,718
The means of which
I'm afraid I've provided.

62
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,392
Well, what's gonna happen, Tony?

63
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,394
When? Where? How?

64
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,194
There's gonna be a funeral...

65
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,670
...an intelligence Iiaison
with the Omega Force, a civilian.

66
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,513
Several of the key officers
will be there to pay their respects.

67
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,432
How will the bomb be disguised?

68
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,957
Well, it could be anything from a pair
of crutches to the American flag.

69
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,439
He'II place it at the gravesite,
Ieave and then set it off.

70
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,833
When is this gonna happen, Tony?

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,072
Tomorrow, 4:00.
Westside Cemetery.

72
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,515
AII right, I'II call Pete,
tell him to notify the authorities.

73
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,557
Tell the brass to stay away
from the funeral.

74
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,597
And get you some protection.

75
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,117
MacGyver, whither thou goest,
I go too.

76
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,039
MacGyver!

77
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,989
He's dead.

78
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,199
What about that other guy,
MacGyver?

79
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,713
We don't know
what Braddock told him.

80
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,233
Killing him shouldn't be difficult.

81
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,311
Yeah? I've heard that song before.

82
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,869
Well, if he had a gun,
he would've used it.

83
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,191
No gun, huh?

84
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,875
Muriatic acid is used
to clean algae off ship hulls.

85
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,318
Add ammonia and it reacts
kind of interestingly.

86
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,277
And of course
we won't mention the smell.

87
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,349
You gotta be careful
when you handle chemicals.

88
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,273
Each of these can be fairly deadly.

89
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,912
But if you mix them together,
they neutralize each other,

90
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,436
and you get instant chemical fog.

91
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,909
The window!

92
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,549
Look.

93
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,629
Forget it. He's out of range.

94
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,873
The trawler's name is Damian.

95
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,632
- Yeah, I can read.
- Yeah.

96
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,870
We gotta trace the registration
and find the home port.

97
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,679
BIood. Looks Iike you hit him.

98
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,276
It's not good enough.
Gotta make sure he's dead.

99
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,398
This is the trawler Damian.

100
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:03,749
Yankee-Bravo-Delta 4792,
calling the San Pedro marine operator.

101
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,115
San Pedro marine operator,
go ahead.

102
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,477
Yeah, I'd Iike to place a call
to my home in Bristol Harbour.

103
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,790
Damian, your transmission
is breaking up.

104
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,520
Please repeat your transmission.

105
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,152
Can you hear me now?

106
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,995
Your transmission is still breaking up.
Please repeat. Go ahead, Damian.

107
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,635
This is the trawler Damian.
Yankee-Bravo-Delta 4792.

108
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,836
Can you hear me now?

109
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,156
Okay, Helen, you called
the Iocal hospitals

110
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,151
and the police and got nothing.

111
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,992
So call MacGyver's place again.

112
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,151
I Ieft another message
five minutes ago.

113
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,914
His machine's running out of tape.

114
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,754
I told him not to go
on this meet alone.

115
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,230
I also told him to call me by 5:00,
and it's past midnight now.

116
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,231
I know.

117
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,992
Get me the police.

118
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,994
They don't Iabel a person missing
till he's been gone for 24 hours.

119
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,798
Well, I can still call them, can't I?

120
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,633
I mean, that is what they're for,
isn't it?

121
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,800
Look, I'm sorry, Helen.
It's getting a Iittle Iate.

122
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,154
Why don't you just go on home.

123
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,709
I will if you will.

124
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,239
Okay, you're the boss.

125
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,391
I'm glad somebody around here
knows that.

126
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,391
I don't wanna Ieave you here alone.

127
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,069
I'm a big boy.

128
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,471
So is MacGyver.

129
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,029
Call me if you need me.

130
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,792
PIease help me.

131
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,236
Who are you?
How did you get on my boat?

132
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,791
Come on, answer me.

133
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,871
- I don't know.
- Just stay right where you are.

134
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,998
- I won't hurt you.
- Yeah, I'II make sure of that.

135
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,758
This is the trawler Damian.

136
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,352
Yankee-Bravo-Delta 4792,

137
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:36,035
calling any Coast Guard unit between
San Pedro and Bristol Harbour.

138
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,349
Coast Guard, do you read me?

139
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,949
Coast Guard, do you read me?

140
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,434
Looks Iike we're stuck
with each other.

141
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,391
Tara, try to access that file again.

142
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,395
There has to be some way
to access that file.

143
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,869
If there is, I don't know it.

144
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,032
The Damian has to be registered with
the Department of Fish and Game.

145
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,189
But it's Sunday night.

146
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,112
AII their computer networks
are shut down.

147
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,918
- Tomorrow morning--
- Tomorrow's too Iate.

148
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,310
The funeral is at 4:00.

149
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,916
If MacGyver's still alive,
he could tip off the world by then.

150
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,840
I'm not in the habit
of picking up hitchhikers.

151
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,718
If we hadn't been in the middle
of the ocean,

152
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,269
I would have tossed you overboard.

153
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,276
Yeah, I'm glad you didn't.

154
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,079
I don't think I could swim that far.

155
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,190
My coffee tastes Iike diesel fuel,
but you want a cup?

156
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,272
PIease.

157
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,633
Now, how'd you get on my boat?

158
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,435
I don't really know.

159
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,069
The Iast thing I remember...

160
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,635
...was I was shot.

161
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,789
Shot?

162
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,799
Look, I'm gonna take you to a doctor,

163
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,439
and then you're gonna talk
to the police,

164
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,158
and then you and I are through.

165
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,434
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to cause you trouble.

166
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,079
You'II be okay.

167
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,997
We can get something to eat
at Phil's Diner once we get in.

168
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,352
This is all I have.

169
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,638
Oh, don't worry about it.
Phil Iets me run a tab.

170
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,079
I'm Carol Varnay.

171
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,790
I just introduced myself.

172
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,076
It's customary to respond in kind.

173
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,279
What's your name?

174
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,794
I don't know.

175
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,831
You don't know your name?

176
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,791
I can't remember.

177
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,992
Hey, not bad.

178
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,789
Thanks. So where are we?

179
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,598
Beautiful Bristol Harbour.

180
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,433
Lots of fishing boats, no fish.

181
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,477
I don't know
if I've ever been here before.

182
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,074
How's your head?

183
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,233
The outside's sore.
The inside's a Iittle empty.

184
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,630
I'm sure glad you came along
when you did.

185
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,075
Thank you.

186
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,356
You're the first thing I've Ianded
in weeks.

187
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,432
What's the matter?

188
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,952
I don't know.

189
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,356
Just remembering something.

190
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,670
Look, Iet me take you
to Dr. Jennings.

191
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,558
He can take a Iook at your head.

192
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,029
No, I'd rather not.

193
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,397
The doctor's gonna ask questions.
I don't have any answers. Yet.

194
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,590
I just need some time to think.

195
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,590
So you will inform us
when you can release information

196
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,432
on the man
who went into the water?

197
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,275
- Yeah. We'II Iet you know.
- Okay.

198
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,758
- Benson, the Times.
- Yeah.

199
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,478
What do you got, Iieutenant?

200
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,438
One murder victim in the warehouse
back there.

201
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,238
Took a 9 mm right in the pump.

202
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,674
Any suspects?

203
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,355
- Investigation's in progress.
- No suspects?

204
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,398
- No.
- Good Iuck to you.

205
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,039
Yeah.

206
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,391
Pete Thornton, Phoenix Foundation.
What have you got?

207
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,357
Oh, yeah. We found some papers
from the Foundation

208
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,795
- in that Jeep over there--
- Never mind the papers now.

209
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,313
What about MacGyver?
Did you find him?

210
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,277
Well, we found this jacket
with this ID in it.

211
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,476
- It was floating in the harbour.
- That Iooks Iike blood.

212
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,710
We're gonna run a Iab test.

213
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,632
What's the coroner's wagon
doing here?

214
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,475
It's a guy named Braddock.
He bought it with a 9 mm. He's dead.

215
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,079
Anything else?

216
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,196
We're gonna start
dragging the harbour.

217
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,635
AII right. Let me know
if you find anything new, will you?

218
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,915
Of course.

219
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,997
Give us a hand over here.

220
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,432
Excuse me, Mr. Thornton.
Benson from the Times.

221
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,478
Didn't you use to do
intelligence work for the DXS?

222
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,073
I've done a Iot of things.
What about it?

223
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,629
This man MacGyver. Was he
on some sort of intelligence operation?

224
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,791
No, he was here to see a friend
about a personal matter.

225
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,319
Did he call you after his meeting?

226
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,038
I haven't talked to him
since yesterday.

227
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,589
Well, is there any reason
anyone would wanna kill him?

228
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,431
Well, we don't know that he's dead,
do we?

229
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,273
I mean, we haven't found a body,
have we?

230
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,269
That's all I have to say.

231
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,034
Well, I'm sorry to intrude,
Mr. Thornton.

232
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,350
I won't bother you again.

233
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,192
This MacGyver has some connection
with Peter Thornton.

234
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,999
Thornton used to be
a DXS operative.

235
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,230
Has MacGyver contacted him yet?

236
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,914
No, but they haven't found
his body either.

237
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,277
If he's alive,
he may still try to reach Thornton.

238
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,230
Registration on the Damian.
Home port is Bristol Harbour.

239
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,039
Owned by a woman
named Carol Varnay.

240
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,149
Jules, get a car. Go up there,
see what you can find out.

241
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,517
We'II meet you
at the old Bristol Harbour Cannery.

242
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,870
Well, you sure know
your way around boats.

243
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,234
Why do you say that?

244
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,992
Way you handle those moorings.

245
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,673
It takes practice.

246
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,193
Figure you either own your own boat

247
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,670
or maybe you worked
as a deck hand on someone else's.

248
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,434
I don't know. Maybe I have.

249
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,078
What is it?

250
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,511
I don't know.

251
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:38,391
Everything I'm remembering is
filled with explosions and gunfights,

252
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,676
and I'm right
in the middle of them.

253
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,393
I don't know why.

254
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,038
Jason, what happened to your bike?

255
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,159
I promise I was careful.
It just broke again.

256
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,677
This is my nephew Jason.
Jason, this is a friend of mine.

257
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,308
- Hi.
- Hi, Jason.

258
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,033
Listen...

259
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,150
...would you be willing
to sacrifice this nameplate

260
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,548
if it would get you going again?

261
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,075
Sure. I guess so.

262
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,759
This happen a Iot?

263
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,150
Yeah, I think this bike is jinxed.

264
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,914
It's Iike it always breaks
at the wrong time.

265
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,832
Things Iike this usually will.

266
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,758
Mine used to come apart every time

267
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,957
I had something
real important to go to.

268
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,959
Where were you headed?

269
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,873
I was on my way to a Little League
game and the chain came off.

270
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,716
I didn't get there until the fifth inning.
We Iost.

271
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,995
See, the problem here

272
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,832
is the sprocket teeth
are all worn down.

273
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,599
What we're gonna do
is make a Iittle guide for the chain.

274
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,310
Ought to keep it on track.

275
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,515
And next time
you'II get to the game early.

276
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,955
Maybe come up with a win.

277
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,994
There. That ought to do it.

278
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,637
Just Iike that.

279
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,075
You fixed it! Thanks!

280
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,793
That was pretty good.

281
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,235
The way you fixed that bike.

282
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,519
Thanks.

283
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,838
Come on. Let's get something to eat.

284
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,431
We should be there
in another 20 minutes.

285
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,919
We're making good time.

286
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,991
How Iong do you think
it took that boat to get there?

287
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,592
Bristol Harbour's 52 miles
up the coast.

288
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,637
The Damian should have
made it back to home port

289
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,074
early this morning.

290
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,438
As of two hours ago, Thornton
hadn't heard from MacGyver.

291
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,957
There are two possibilities:

292
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,350
Either he's alive or he's dead.

293
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,192
If he's dead, they'II bury him.

294
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,715
If not, we'II find him and kill him.

295
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,029
It's that simple.

296
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,111
It's not simple at all.

297
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,669
If MacGyver's passed on
his information,

298
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,354
this whole thing could blow up
in our faces.

299
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,830
Speaking of which, when are we going
to pick up the explosive?

300
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,594
Oh, it's been here all along.

301
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,116
Woven right into the Iining.

302
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,750
AII I have to do is set the timer.

303
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,517
So how Iong have you Iived here?

304
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,079
AII my Iife.

305
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,754
I grew up here
with my dad and brother.

306
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,239
A Iot of memories.

307
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,992
We were pretty inseparable.

308
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,079
"Were"?

309
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,032
Yeah, you know that storm
two years ago?

310
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,192
EIeanor? Took them overboard.

311
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,475
Never found them.

312
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,833
I'm sorry.

313
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,709
The Varnays are fishermen.
AIways have been.

314
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,828
So now I've got the Damian and...

315
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,389
I know I should sell her, but...

316
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,999
You know what
I really want to get into?

317
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,429
What?

318
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,679
Marine science. Research.

319
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,756
- Why don't you?
- It's not that easy.

320
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,838
There's something
about that boat and this place.

321
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,433
It's got a hold on me.

322
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,355
It sounds Iike you're trapped
by things you remember.

323
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,110
I'm trapped by things I can't.

324
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,955
Phoenix.

325
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,594
Phoenix.

326
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,113
Arizona?

327
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,999
No.

328
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,595
No.

329
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,478
Something's coming back,
but I can't get a handle on it.

330
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,075
Has it got something to do

331
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,391
with the mythology of the bird
rising out of the ashes?

332
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,069
No. No.

333
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,677
Business?

334
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,672
An address or something?

335
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,878
Could it be a person's name?

336
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,429
Somebody you know, a friend?

337
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,353
Or maybe it's a symbol.
You know, Iike a sign.

338
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,832
A sign-- A sign maybe
where you work?

339
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,189
The Phoenix Foundation.

340
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,710
It's in Los Angeles.

341
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,032
Come on, what's the number?

342
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,474
Well, call information.

343
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,200
No, it's a special number.

344
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,839
A private one.

345
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,158
I called Sam Taylor in Washington

346
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,515
and asked for an update
on Anthony Braddock,

347
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,671
including all current connections.

348
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,114
And what did he say?

349
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,076
That you no Ionger have
unlimited security access.

350
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,037
Sam said that?

351
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,872
What is he doing,
turning bureaucrat on me?

352
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,314
Get him on the phone right away.

353
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,710
- Calm down.
- I wanna talk to him!

354
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,077
I reminded him of the time
you covered his tail in Marseilles.

355
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,993
And that I still had the pictures.

356
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,832
You kept those shots?

357
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,958
No, but he doesn't know that.

358
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,511
So Anthony Braddock is tied to
someone with the code name Lancer.

359
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,478
Nationality unknown. No home base.

360
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,311
Well, what does this...

361
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,999
...Lancer do?

362
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,879
He kills people. AII over the world.

363
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,349
Strictly cash on the gravestone.

364
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,432
Sam says they think Lancer
is planning a hit.

365
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,830
Could be anytime now.

366
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,672
Could be MacGyver.

367
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,919
That's gotta be the police.

368
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,877
I gave them the private Iine.

369
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,075
Yes?

370
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,312
Hello. Is this
the Phoenix Foundation?

371
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,357
MacGyver! Where are you?

372
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,914
MacGyver, is that you?

373
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,399
MacGyver.

374
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,030
Come on, answer!
Helen, get on the other line.

375
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,078
- Do you know him?
- Oh, he's my ace buddy.

376
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,438
He's Iost his memory.

377
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,677
Well, if he'II come along with me,

378
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,116
I'II try and help him find it.
Right this way.

379
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,676
Don't talk, just move.

380
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,276
Talk to me!

381
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,879
Talk to me!

382
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,591
So who are you?

383
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,395
- What do you want with me?
- No questions.

384
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,271
Come on, Iet's get out of here.

385
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,269
MacGyver, this is Pete.
You gotta answer me. Please!

386
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,036
You gotta answer me. MacGyver!

387
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,828
Carol, could that guy
have been the police?

388
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,719
No, if he was the police,
he would've said so.

389
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,871
Besides, what do the police
want with you?

390
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,715
I don't know. But things
are starting to come back to me.

391
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,519
That Phoenix Foundation,
that was real.

392
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,593
I gotta have time to think.

393
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,797
- Well, do it at my place. Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait.

394
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,189
Look.

395
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,397
I don't want to get you in trouble.

396
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,076
If I want your advice, pal, I'II ask for it.
Now come on.

397
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,675
MacGyver was on the telephone
when I got there.

398
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,389
Said something about
Phoenix Foundation.

399
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,233
Peter Thornton.
What did MacGyver tell him?

400
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,913
I didn't give him a chance
to say anything.

401
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,196
- That's when I pulled my gun.
- That's why you're an idiot.

402
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,679
Don't call me that.

403
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,751
I'm the one that found Braddock
in the first place.

404
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,194
But you Iet MacGyver get away.

405
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,952
- Look, don't you start.
- She's right.

406
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,792
If you don't Iike the way
I'm handling things,

407
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,076
then pay me off and I'm gone.

408
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,110
But I've got enough on the both of you
to put you away until you rot.

409
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,670
So I guess I'm not
such an idiot after all.

410
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,752
Of course not, Jules. I apologize.

411
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,831
You did what you felt you had to do.

412
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,279
Besides, he didn't
tell Thornton anything.

413
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,112
The girl said he Iost his memory.

414
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,034
Carol Varnay.
Find her home address.

415
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,792
I'II set the detonator.

416
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,472
So...

417
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,355
...MacGyver has amnesia.

418
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,080
And amnesia
is not a permanent condition.

419
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,708
It just has to Iast
until the funeral today.

420
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,472
I don't think we can count on that.

421
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,474
Very good, Jules.

422
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,712
Now Thornton knows
MacGyver is still alive,

423
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,917
and if he had the call traced,
he'II be on his way.

424
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,275
If he gets to MacGyver
before we do--

425
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,829
Well, we can't Iet
that happen, can we?

426
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,639
AII right, thank you. That's great.

427
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,791
That call from MacGyver
came from a public phone

428
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,520
on the Bristol Harbour pier,
30 miles north of here.

429
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,671
I'm going up there. Call Sam Taylor.

430
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,479
I want the Iatest information
he's got on this Lancer character.

431
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,996
- Wait! Take your coat!
- Thank you.

432
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,155
No answer?

433
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,949
No. And it's the same number
I called before.

434
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,758
Someone was there.

435
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,229
Now, the man on the phone
called you MacGyver.

436
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,072
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

437
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,117
No, it's just a name.

438
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,554
Well, it's a start.

439
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,349
Now, Iook, all we've gotta do is put
the pieces of this puzzle together.

440
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,839
I'm great at puzzles.

441
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,878
Carol, everything I'm remembering
is so violent.

442
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,951
For all we know,
I could be a criminal.

443
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,553
I don't think you are.

444
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,075
- I could be.
- Do you feel Iike one?

445
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,598
No.

446
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,075
But with all these flashes of memory,
what if I am?

447
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,117
I'II take my chances.

448
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,592
Hi.

449
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,989
Hi.

450
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,073
Did you happen to see a man
using that end phone there?

451
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,595
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

452
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,591
He's a good friend,
a really good friend of mine,

453
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,954
and he's in trouble.

454
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,835
Well, what's he Iook Iike?

455
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,752
Well, he's kind of tall,
a Iittle over six feet.

456
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,913
He's got brown hair, Iong in back,
brown eyes.

457
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,229
He's a nice guy.

458
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,437
He doesn't dress Iike me.
Kind of casual.

459
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,195
He was here.

460
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,588
I never said.

461
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,079
He made that!

462
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,434
How did you know?

463
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,319
Well, Iet's just say
I recognize the work.

464
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,158
His name is MacGyver.
He can fix anything.

465
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,756
He could fix a computer with a hairpin
and a piece of duct tape.

466
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,638
Just Iike he fixed your bike.

467
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,995
Will you help me to help him?

468
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,277
Tara, do you have the address
of the Varnay house?

469
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,837
MacGyver and the girl
can both make me.

470
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,036
I want to take care of them now.

471
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,351
Fine, Jules. The sooner the better.

472
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,473
I thought you wanted
MacGyver alive.

473
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,756
- I do.
- Then why did you say that?

474
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,798
I have to assume MacGyver
told Thornton about our plan.

475
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,996
And Thornton is setting a trap
for me at the funeral.

476
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,752
You don't have to go through with it.

477
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,353
I have a contract.

478
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,591
But you have to protect yourself...

479
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,113
...and the organization.

480
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,039
If there is a trap,
I can use MacGyver to get Thornton.

481
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,156
And Jules can help me do it.

482
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,718
I keep getting so close to putting
everything together, and then...

483
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,231
...nothing happens.

484
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,079
It could be anything from a pair
of crutches to the American flag.

485
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,311
- MacGyver?
- MacGyver!

486
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,513
MacGyver?

487
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,800
- He's dead.
- Who?

488
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,075
I saw him get shot.

489
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,629
What? What are you talking about?

490
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,389
I'm really not sure.
Something about a killing.

491
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,790
Killing? Where?

492
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,151
At a cemetery.

493
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,396
The Westside Cemetery.

494
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,677
Who? Who's gonna get killed?

495
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,991
I don't know.
But it's gonna happen today.

496
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,311
I'm gonna try that
Phoenix Foundation number again.

497
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,669
- Your phone is dead.
- And so are you.

498
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,913
Carol, get out of here!
Get the police!

499
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,949
Get up!

500
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,237
GIad I got here in time.

501
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,917
Are you okay?

502
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,390
- Yeah.
- Guess the target was you.

503
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,790
You just saved my Iife.
Who are you?

504
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,748
MacGyver,
you really don't know who I am?

505
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,433
I've Iost my memory.

506
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,113
It's J. D.

507
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,513
Jonathan Dawkins.
Military intelligence.

508
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,238
I'm your boss.

509
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,756
Don't you remember anything?

510
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,714
AII I remember is that
there's gonna be a killing

511
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,199
at the Westside Cemetery.

512
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,476
I don't know how I know that or why.

513
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,392
Well, that was your assignment.

514
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,551
That's what we sent you in
to find out.

515
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,438
Do you know when
this is taking place?

516
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,953
Sometime today.

517
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,997
That's the Thompkins funeral.

518
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,355
The officers from
the Omega Force will be there.

519
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,589
Omega Force?

520
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,076
The cemetery's an hour away.
We still have time get there.

521
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,310
I need you to stop the killer.

522
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,595
Any idea who it is?

523
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,832
Oh, we've got a suspect.
He's a professional terrorist.

524
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,399
His name's Peter Thornton.

525
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,151
Mobile command post
to Omega base.

526
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,675
Omega base, this is Major Dawkins.

527
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,354
We're on our way
to the Westside Cemetery.

528
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,034
Set up our perimeter security,
but keep it covert.

529
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,438
We don't want our suspect Thornton
to cut and run.

530
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,116
I'II remain in contact.

531
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,039
So how Iong have I been
with military intelligence?

532
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,918
Oh, it'II be five years next month.

533
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,032
We'II get you the best help available.

534
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,033
But first we've gotta stop
this assassination.

535
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,158
We've gotta know if your information
has been compromised.

536
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,198
Peter Thornton is a member
of a terrorist group.

537
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,669
The front is called
the Phoenix Foundation.

538
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,591
Phoenix Foundation.

539
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,508
Yeah, I talked to somebody there.
I'm not sure who it was.

540
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,557
Well, that had
to have been Thornton.

541
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,314
He's the man who engineered
the coup down in San Cortez.

542
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,232
You've been Iooking for him
for five years.

543
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,709
And he's been trying to kill you.

544
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,997
MacGyver, if you remember anything,
remember this face.

545
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,074
Half an hour.

546
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,232
If I'd found out half an hour earlier
I might have been here in time.

547
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,436
What do you think has happened
to MacGyver?

548
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,953
I'm afraid Lancer has him.

549
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,873
The only information we have on him
is that he's planning an assassination.

550
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,029
And we don't know where.

551
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,270
MacGyver said something
about a killing.

552
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,874
- He what?
- It was all in bits and pieces,

553
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,032
but he said it was
supposed to happen today

554
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,031
at the Westside Cemetery.

555
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,195
Oh, that's gotta be it.
Thank you. Thank you, Miss Varnay.

556
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,952
Pull it up right here.

557
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,148
Wait for us
on the upper service road.

558
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,151
You okay?

559
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,639
If anything happens,
if Thornton shows up,

560
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,597
you know who he is
and what he's trying to do.

561
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,035
Don't take any chances.

562
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,991
That's right, Helen,
the Westside Cemetery.

563
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,513
And, oh, I need police backup.

564
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,478
What is a man that God
might take notice of him?

565
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,358
My friends...

566
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:14,709
...Joe Thompkins was the kind of man
God and all of us surely noticed.

567
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,874
And we will miss him
more than we can measure.

568
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,753
He was a beloved husband
and father,

569
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,593
a dear and Ioyal friend.

570
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,753
And though we have come together
today to mourn his passing,

571
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,558
we rejoice in the triumph of his Iife...

572
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,278
I'm checking perimeter security.

573
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,590
Keep an eye out for Thornton.

574
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,672
--will return to our Heavenly Father
who made it,

575
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:44,995
and that his soul will be forever part
of the glory of God's holy kingdom.

576
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:50,280
But remember, our Lord said,
"BIessed are the peacemakers."

577
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,833
In a world shattered
by senseless violence

578
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,992
that so tragically often strikes
at the innocent,

579
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,278
our friend was a peacemaker.

580
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,675
He saw the task.

581
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,712
He accepted it.

582
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,270
He made of his Iife a testament
to his country,

583
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,477
his service, his people.

584
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,153
He defended flag and country

585
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,029
in faraway places,
fighting for the right...

586
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,549
MacGyver!

587
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,672
Hold it. Stay right there.

588
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,992
I know you've got amnesia.

589
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,309
You don't know who I am, do you?

590
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,153
You're Peter Thornton.
You're a killer.

591
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,714
Put down the gun.

592
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,074
I wouldn't.

593
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,028
I have a picture in my wallet
of the two of us together.

594
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,033
- I want to show it to you.
- I said, don't move.

595
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,439
Right now I know you better
than you know yourself.

596
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,989
You don't use guns.

597
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,393
That gun doesn't feel right
in your hand.

598
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,357
It can't.

599
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,911
You don't use guns, MacGyver.
You hate them.

600
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,074
That number you called
at the Phoenix Foundation.

601
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,356
That was my number.

602
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,839
You were trying to reach me,
whether you knew it or not.

603
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,037
I saved your Iife.

604
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,394
You were buried in an avalanche.

605
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,232
And I dug you out.

606
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,039
I saved you.

607
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,392
Somewhere deep inside
you've got to know that.

608
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,476
MacGyver, we're coming!

609
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,392
Go easy, go easy.
We don't wanna hit him.

610
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,309
Easy. Take it easy. Look out, now.

611
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,269
Are you all right?

612
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,197
Thanks, Pete.

613
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,234
Pete.

614
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,397
Thank God.

615
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,471
Tony Braddock said
there's gonna be a killing.

616
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,959
Did he tell you about Lancer?

617
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,839
Lancer's gonna do it at the funeral.

618
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,149
Come on.

619
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,439
Lancer planted an explosive.

620
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,589
- Where?
- I don't know.

621
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,193
I'II clear the area.

622
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,159
--will follow me
all the days of my Iife,

623
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,756
and I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever.

624
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,319
AII right, everyone.

625
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,034
- Down. Down.
- Move out of the area.

626
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,832
You can mould it Iike plastic

627
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,355
or weave it like cloth.

628
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,750
Or weave it Iike cloth.

629
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,554
Like cloth.

630
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,112
It's the coat. The bomb's in the coat.

631
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,598
MacGyver, is that Lancer?

632
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,629
- Yeah.
- Is that--?

633
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,949
- Yeah!
- Well, get rid of it!

634
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,758
I am!

635
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,349
If you knew this was happening,
why didn't you call the police?

636
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,919
I did.

637
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,274
Well, I'II be.

638
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,755
Nice to meet you again, Pete.

639
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,233
So you mean
the Phoenix Foundation

640
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,356
pays you a bonus
after every assignment?

641
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,750
No, well, they don't exactly pay.

642
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,638
They kind of do things.

643
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,233
They arranged for me
to have a scrimmage

644
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,197
with a pro hockey team one time

645
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,397
and arranged for a scholarship
for a Iittle girl.

646
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,198
And...

647
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,190
...they bought some new wheels
for a friend of mine.

648
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,716
Is it really for me?

649
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,474
Yeah, I'd say it's about the right size.

650
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,756
Thanks, MacGyver.

651
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,475
Check it out.

652
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,476
So you are one of the good guys
after all.

653
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,278
Told you.

654
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,714
Oh, you did more than that.

655
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,511
You saved my Iife.

656
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,831
And the Iives of a Iot
of other people too. Thank you.

657
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,037
You made me Iook at my Iife
in a whole new way.

658
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,316
Memories are okay to have

659
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,516
as Iong as they don't
get in the way of dreams.

660
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,996
Am I hearing
what I think I'm hearing?

661
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,195
Marine science. Going back to school.
Nights and weekends.

662
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,875
It's gonna take a Iittle Ionger,
but I'II do it.

663
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,758
And you'II be invited to graduation.

664
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,672
Well, that's something I won't forget.

665
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,071
MacGyver! Look! Watch this.
