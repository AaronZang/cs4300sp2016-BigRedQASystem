4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,300
Big Al has a huge cock.

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,800
Seriously. I'm not kidding.

6
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,700
It's giant.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,500
It seems it has arms and
legs. What is life itself.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,200
As a baby I could bring
shoulder to burp, get it?

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,800
It looks like a tool
plumber. The first time I saw ...

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,900
said: "Keep that thing.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,000
You will not get close
me with this monster. "

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,400
But you know Big Al

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,300
He was coming
holla at me.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,200
He looked at me and said:

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,300
Think you can?

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,500
Think you can?

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,000
I mean ...

18
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,500
It was like ...

19
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm competitive, you know?

20
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,000
I did gymnastics
competitive in high school.

21
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,000
So I took another look.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,700
And I thought, I can
lots of fun trying.

23
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
You know?

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,500
I have to say
clamber tasty.

25
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,500
I'm talking about climbing
tied to the bedpost ...

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,300
with sweaty dirty socks, you know?

27
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,400
You know. Big Al

28
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,300
The king of the hill.

29
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,200
You can say what you want
him, but he climbs and cavies.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,074

So.

32
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,300
Sing it.

33
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,600
I have some ...

34
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,300
new toasters at home.

35
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,900
I want to.

36
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,600
- Where's Reilly?
- Not seen.

37
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,200
Watch it, baby.

38
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,200
Hey, baby.

39
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,700
- Hey, Muggles.
- Where is he?

40
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,200
Ali

41
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,100
Boxy.

42
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,200
- I said I did not want that type.
- You said you wanted customers.

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,900
Do not worry. He
is clean. Checked-in.

44
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,000
Will make money for us.

45
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,400
Wait here, okay?

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
How are you?

47
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,400
Okay.

48
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,500
Where are you from?

49
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,600
- Long Island.
- Really?

50
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,700
What can I do for you?

51
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,000
I want a gun.

52
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,100
Are you stupid?

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,200
Could you speak louder? Whether
broadcast in radio news?

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,100
- Sorry.
- Got it?

55
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,600
Where on Long Island?

56
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,800
Ice Peak.

57
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,400
- Earth Rangers.
- What?

58
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,400
Earth Rangers.
Are you retarded?

59
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,300
Rangers.

60
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,800
- Rangers.
- Yes.

61
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,800
This is an interview?

62
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,400
I just want my 45.

63
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,800
Stop!

64
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,100
Liar!

65
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,000
- Enough!
- Go fuck yourself!

66
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,000
- What is it?
- It's clean.

67
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,600
You do not have guns.

68
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,700
You came too soon.

69
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,100
That's right.

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,800
- You knew what you had to do.
- And did what I had!

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,800
You have it here?

72
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,700
Hands off my
dick and get the hell out of here.

73
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,400
Or process you for harassment.

74
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,600
Bunch of fags
like the Village People.

75
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,200
Get the hell out of my bar.

76
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,200
- Bitch!
- I'll get you!

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We'll get you!

78
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,700
Kiss my dick, your
fucking asshole!

79
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,200
Pull the car from my bar!

80
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Goodbye.

81
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,600
You're hot, B.

82
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
- Yeah?
- Sexy.

83
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Let's Get Away
resolve an issue.

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,100
Big Al

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,800
It was always a troublemaker.

86
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,400
Since he was born.

87
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,200
Son of a bitch! How?

88
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,400
- What have I done?
- I thought I had checked it!

89
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,000
- We checked yes.
- And so they weave for me?

90
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,600
Cesarean section. 48 hours of delivery.

91
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,700
Fucking kid!
Never won anything!

92
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,400
Should have aborted.

93
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,200
Can not manage a
organization as well, ok?

94
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,900
It is a slouch.
Thing amateur.

95
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,300
You have to time it right.

96
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,700
I do not know what you mean.

97
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,400
He never spends the holidays in
home. It's Thanksgiving holiday.

98
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,100
But you will not find it here.

99
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,700
Neither knows what is
or family loyalty.

100
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,100
I do not know what went wrong with it.

101
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,500
Not smoked or drank in my
pregnancy. No drop.

102
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,900
Only beer and wine, but
it's no problem.

103
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,500
I'm tired of it, God!

104
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
What are you doing?

105
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,100
Go to fucking hell!

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,300
You go. You promised you
would take me from this neighborhood!

107
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,100
Right?

108
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,300
Seaside Heights, Rockway, Ocean
City, etc.. You're treading on the ball.

109
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,800
Go fuck yourself!

110
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,700
I want to see the real world.

111
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,400
- The real world.
- I'm tired of this shit!

112
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,600
What a fucking real world?
You got the whole world right here!

113
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,400
Fuck Jesus!

114
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,300
Come here, assholes!
Dinner's ready!

115
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,300
Sorry, but I hate
Thanksgiving.

116
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,500
I did not create a killer
but the streets did.

117
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,600
Stop.

118
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,600
My TV!

119
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,100
Fucking thief!

120
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
This does not!

121
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,500
Our new TV!

122
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,700
Son of a bitch!

123
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,700
He fainted.

124
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,500
Fuck. Look what
he did with the TV!

125
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,900
Had to
do that, sir?

126
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,400
- Sorry.
- Shit!

127
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,700
Call the police, go!

128
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,100
Why the hype.
I was just trying to steal.

129
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,400
Do not believe you!

130
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,300
49 West Street, 527. It is a
emergency. You have a thief in the house.

131
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,300
Outta the carpet!

132
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,300
It is an original Persian. It's expensive!

133
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,600
Sorry. I made a mistake.

134
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,600
Never come back. Sorry.

135
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,000
Get out of my fucking carpet!

136
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,400
Please do not kill me.
Sorry, please.

137
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,000
Sorry.

138
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,200
No wonder that
not passed by the window.

139
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,800
Look at the size of your ass!

140
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,900
This shit seems
a parking lot.

141
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,400
It has to start making Cooper
asshole!

142
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,100
Please!

143
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,300
I hope you
RG naturalized.

144
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,500
Please let me go.

145
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,700
You are from the Punjab or
is there wherever you go.

146
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,000
Sorry!

147
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,500
You disgust me, you know?

148
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,100
- Sorry to have broken the TV.
- Your fucking, you come here,

149
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:06,600
They take our jobs and then ...
You are parasites. Make me sick.

150
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,100
What's happening
with that country?

151
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,300
What's happening
with the fucking parents?

152
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,900
Come back to there.

153
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,100
It's the people who
being stolen.

154
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,200
Sorry, please
let me go!

155
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,800
I have a family on the bus.

156
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,000
Bus? You have a
bus down there?

157
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,300
You broke the TV,
I'll take the bus.

158
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,100
Ok? Number 6, 9 ...

159
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,100
I do not wrap.

160
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,300
I was lying.

161
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,900
This shit is mine.

162
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,400
- Do not put your hand!
- I'm not a coach.

163
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,700
But please, let me go!

164
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,700
Al, I have two toasters.

165
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,200
And the blue uniform of the navy.

166
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,800
42 normal for my nephew
is coming to town.

167
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,800
- And three packets of menthol.
- Right.

168
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,600
- Al
- Yes.

169
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,200
Not my fault. Vim
pro wrong address.

170
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,600
- What happened here?
- I caught him trying to rob me.

171
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,100
Lady, please. This
crazy trying to kill me.

172
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,700
What are you doing?
Stop! It was not your home!

173
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,100
- Whether these to his nephew?
- Yes, they are legal.

174
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,800
- On the house, okay?
- Cool.

175
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,300
So ...

176
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,100
- Cash or charge?
- Money.

177
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,600
Unless you have a
those cards "cold."

178
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,200
Maybe. But it has
to give a kiss.

179
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,400
Fuck you!

180
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,300
His problems began with
my husband and I separated.

181
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,400
He was a wino
Scottish fucking!

182
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,700
It took Al to
to Scotland, you know?

183
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,400
And when Al came back, he
was more tough and mean.

184
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,300
And also never
lost the accent.

185
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,400
Move to the right.

186
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,500
Ai is left.

187
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,200
What the hell is going on?

188
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,600
Hold it. He
is in the bathroom.

189
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,600
- Who?
- The thief!

190
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,600
What the hell are you doing?

191
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,200
What the fuck?

192
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,000
- Is that funny?
- You are a joke?

193
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,700
- Should I call the police again?
- No joke, ok?

194
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
I found a criminal
of truth for you!

195
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,100
I'm fed up with the
do your work, ok?

196
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
He's on the fucking
bathroom. Open the door!

197
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,900
Police! Glad you are
here, please help me!

198
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,000
This guy has weapons
throughout the house!

199
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,500
This guy is a comedian.

200
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,500
Your shitty comedian.
They have no warrant.

201
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,200
Why not read the
U.S. Constitution.

202
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,600
And you, hey.

203
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,400
Come, take this asshole
outta my house

204
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,200
before I tell your supervisor
they are harassing me.

205
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,100
Big Al fuck.
I'm not afraid of him.

206
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,400
I'm not afraid of that asshole.

207
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,400
As his ass
right here, man.

208
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,900
Fuck him. Never liked him.

209
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,900
He never liked that
Puerto Rican here.

210
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,400
Let it be so. If
I did this to him?

211
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,300
Of course not. He is walking in flip-flops,
My business is big fish.

212
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,900
Fuck him!

213
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,600
Asshole!

214
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,900
And what about
my needs?

215
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,600
- What?
- Yes, my needs.

216
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,700
I suck.

217
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,000
- I suck you good.
- Call it sucking?

218
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,300
I call it
the appetizer.

219
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,100
Blowjob of lightning. Right?

220
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,900
Mosquito has sucked me better.
Even stink best ever sucked.

221
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,200
What business is it of selling
a gun without telling me?

222
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,500
- What are you talking about?
- Ok

223
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,800
So think
I do not know about this shit?

224
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,700
Clancy said.

225
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,400
Why are you doing
business on my back?

226
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,000
He needed a weapon.
What should I do?

227
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,800
Spoil the deal?
Your money is there.

228
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,800
- How much?
- Same as always.

229
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,300
$ 400 in the drawer
his underwear, okay?

230
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,300
Near the swineherd.

231
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,600
- You are trying to wrap myself?
- Enough, for God's sake.

232
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,100
You're giving pro Clancy.
He is a son of a bitch.

233
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,900
- I understand how he looks?
- Knock it off. I sleep with a guy.

234
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,000
Stop talking shit.

235
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,400
First, I hear they're selling
arms behind my back.

236
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,900
Oh, I get home
and you do not tell me.

237
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,000
- Then ask to suck my dick ...
- Shut up!

238
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,000
- And you do not suck.
- Shut up!

239
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,300
Who told you?

240
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,100
Hellen.

241
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,700
Son of a bitch!

242
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,700
Son of a bitch.

243
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,300
These men fucking.

244
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,700
Big Al thinks the worst thing

245
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,400
can do is
sleeping with another guy.

246
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,800
Leave the other guy to eat you.

247
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,100
But he could
eat other, right?

248
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,700
He made it all the time.

249
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,000
Pras women one thing,
to other men.

250
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,600
Favoring it.

251
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,600
This business does not stick with me.

252
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,400
I do not understand.

253
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,300
I do not know why guys think
who are overcoming a relationship.

254
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,800
They think they're
"Eating us."

255
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,400
When I sleep with a guy.

256
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,400
I guarantee that he knows
Who is eating whom.

257
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,200
And shove my finger in his
ass just so he knows it.

258
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,300
It did not pass my 45
by mistake, right?

259
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,400
- What?
- The 45.

260
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,500
No. I'm not stupid. Was another.

261
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,300
That is recorded
in my name, ok?

262
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,600
Suck their fingers.

263
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,400
- I'm getting horny.
- I know.

264
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:44,900
Right? Do not touch the 45, okay?

265
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,700
Want to know Al? He is very
good at getting things.

266
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,300
Cars, jewelry, clothes.

267
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,000
Women. But he
do not know look after them.

268
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,100
I was his property.

269
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,200
You can find me crazy, but I
wanted something more than that, okay?

270
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,800
Oh, and nobody broke
most want to go out,

271
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,000
all the guys are afraid.

272
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,900
I have to go out with guys
New Jersey. Horrible.

273
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,200
What?

274
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,300
- It's Vic.
- It had to be that same bitch.

275
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,800
Shut up, she's my friend.
One second!

276
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,000
Do not stand her.
She always ruins everything.

277
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,800
Shut up!

278
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,300
- She is bisexual, ok?
- So what? Still a dyke.

279
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,800
You have to remember
his affair with her?

280
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,800
Once was.
Large to be boring.

281
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,100
A second, sweetie.

282
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,700
- Hi
- Hi, sweetheart.

283
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,500
- How are you, lindona.
- Fine.

284
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,800
Nothing lesbianism
in front of me.

285
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,900
- Unless I'm in the middle.
- Not Call him.

286
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,500
Okay, I do not
fucked slimy.

287
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,100
How are you?

288
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,700
You look great.

289
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,000
Your hair is awesome!

290
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,900
Like it?
Do you think her hair is great?

291
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,600
Looks like she got
with a spanner.

292
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,100
- Shut up.
- Nice to see you too, man.

293
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,800
- Sit down. Want a drink?
- Yes.

294
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,500
She lives with me now,
dyke, okay?

295
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,700
Looks like it.
Since I knocked on the door

296
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,600
and she answered, etc..

297
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,100
Al, still confused?

298
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,900
- What?
- Are you still drunk?

299
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,200
- Go home, you can.
- It's so obvious?

300
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,100
- You fucking wino!
- Come on, boner.

301
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,000
Son of a bitch!

302
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,700
My God! Al, stop it!

303
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,700
- Jesus Christ!
- You are a moron.

304
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,600
You are living proof that
We should all be lesbians.

305
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,800
Yes, I think
just a turn.

306
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,800
- So, your hair looks amazing.
- Thanks.

307
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,800
Really cool.

308
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,400
- And I've been working out very well.
- Yeah?

309
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,700
I won in 5cm
2 arms and chest.

310
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,100
Legal.

311
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,300
I have to have shoulders
wide to beat the Al

312
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,400
Since I met Al,
wanted him to die.

313
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,200
I hated his masculinity.

314
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,700
His essence.

315
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,700
It was not your fault
he could not escape it.

316
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,800
He was so. Product
of his horrible childhood.

317
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,200
But ...

318
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,400
Give a kiss.

319
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,300
See what is missing?

320
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,300
Even more.

321
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,800
No tongue kiss
while I'm away, girls.

322
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,400
I enjoyed it there within five minutes.

323
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,000
Thanks for the warning.

324
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,300
Get out.

325
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,000
Clean bar?

326
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,900
- Who is it?
- Jose Vargas.

327
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,500
What?

328
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,900
We should say that
not sold to Jose.

329
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,800
He would kill me if she knew
sold to a Puerto Rican.

330
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,200
As long as he does not think ...

331
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,500
sold to a Puerto Rican,
we're good at.

332
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,100
He's just brute force and
I the girl with the plans.

333
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,400
I am a businesswoman, I have
any big plans.

334
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,900
- You have big plans?
- Yes.

335
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,900
- You know.
- I hope I'm included.

336
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,100
You know you are.

337
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,800
If he hurt you again,
I kill it.

338
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,500
I promise.

339
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,000
My daughter Kat.

340
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,000
The danger always attracted her.
Even when I was a little girl.

341
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,200
She was always
doing what could not.

342
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,700
Ordered her not to do,
and she did it anyway.

343
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,200
"Do not drink." and she drank.
"Do not do drugs." and she wore.

344
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,600
"Beware of the boys."
Forget it.

345
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,800
She always challenged.

346
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,800
Always wanted too.

347
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,300
Never wanted to be normal.
She had to be special.

348
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
And look what happened.

349
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,100
I'm not surprised.

350
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,100
She was always beautiful and
Proud of your hair.

351
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,400
And she inherited it from me.

352
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:32,000
You get more ass
that toilet.

353
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,200
I'm talking about
Quality Ass.

354
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
Quality fuck.

355
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,100
What matters is what
is in the middle of the legs.

356
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,400
- You have to Kat.
- Okay, man.

357
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,700
You can not have everything, right?

358
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,200
I think I'll go back to Dell.

359
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,600
Let this woman go.
She's a bitch.

360
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,100
She gave my ass so many times that he
looks like a scientific experiment.

361
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,700
So what? It excites me.

362
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,700
If it excites you. You're the man
that more lives full of lust.

363
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,800
You would do anything
by a pussy.

364
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,900
I decided to change his life.

365
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,100
- What?
- I'm going back to Catholic again.

366
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,500
- I'll give up everything.
- Dude.

367
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,300
I am tired of hearing
this litany. I've heard this before.

368
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,300
Enough. I want a normal life.

369
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,800
A life and a normal job.

370
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,100
- What do we do?
- Nothing much.

371
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,900
Nothing illegal, ok?

372
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,800
I've said that from this
tomorrow my life is another.

373
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,700
You have to change
completely.

374
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,300
You know ...

375
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,500
Always have a place for you

376
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,500
in my organization.

377
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,300
You'll be mine
right arm again.

378
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,700
Do not you hear me, man?
What the fuck are you talking about?

379
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,200
Never been his right arm.

380
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,500
I was independent. Did
my own work.

381
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,400
Never worked for you, Al!

382
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,500
You need me, man!

383
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,400
Bullshit.

384
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,600
The only thing
need you

385
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,000
is a woman like Kat.
It's what I need.

386
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,300
What the fuck is this obsession?

387
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,700
It is not obsession.

388
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,800
It's a great girl.
Just that.

389
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,100
Slope there.

390
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,500
- What's happening?
- I'll steal that car.

391
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,900
It's the car that stole
last week.

392
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,700
Yeah, right.
And now I have to return.

393
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,000
The guy who stole a paid

394
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,700
great reward
for his recovery.

395
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,900
I better be
legal and return.

396
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,300
And the guy who sold it to?

397
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Fuck him. He is a foot
scuff normal work.

398
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,300
Just like you want to be.
A normal guy.

399
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,700
Normal guys to fuck, Big Al did not.
That's what happens.

400
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,200
You will earn one month
wage in 10 seconds.

401
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,500
Deal or no, Mr. Normal?

402
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,800
It's the last time, Al's over.

403
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,700
Last time.

404
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,600
Al should have left the neighborhood.

405
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,200
Kat wanted it.

406
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,800
The way
things resulted ...

407
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,900
Al should have listened to her.

408
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,200
If I wanted to kill Al?

409
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,400
Yes! Many times.

410
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,800
He had something for
which I kill him?

411
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,600
Yes

412
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,200
Hi, ladies.

413
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,100
- Are you the money?
- Right here.

414
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,700
Passes for here!

415
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,900
- Why do not you get me?
- Bitch.

416
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,100
Kidding.
Come here, baby.

417
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,300
You know
you would not curl.

418
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,500
Yeah it goes here.

419
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,800
- I like doing business with you.
- Yeah?

420
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,800
The way they always do.
Strip legs of me.

421
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,000
I would do much
more with you, honey.

422
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,700
And who would not?

423
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,600
You need a man
like me, dear, you know?

424
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,000
- I could show you some things.
- Yeah?

425
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,700
My boyfriend, Big Al,
would not like that very much.

426
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,200
I can hit on your boyfriend.

427
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,700
I'm not interested,
Sanches, get out, thanks.

428
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,100
You could get rid of it?

429
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,900
It would be easy.
Why is he with?

430
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,700
He is walking in flip-flops.
A lindona like you.

431
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
You need to be with
a man who

432
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
is reaching
somewhere. Like me.

433
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,400
- Oh yeah?
- Yes.

434
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,900
You are going to jail.

435
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,300
Even more, Chico.

436
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,400
I'll never want to eat
you "or" this attitude.

437
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,400
You can eat attitude,
but I would be more delicious.

438
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,500
Even more.

439
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,600
Juanita, who delights.

440
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,700
I can not express
my gratitude, detective.

441
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,900
It's incredible that neither is a risk
it. Thank you very much.

442
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,900
Sure.

443
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,100
If I can do
something for you ...

444
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,400
Listen. The District
contact you tomorrow.

445
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,900
- Ok
- Ok, thanks. Whatever you need.

446
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,600
Thanks.

447
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,800
Thank you.

448
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,900
Sex with men is like snow.

449
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,300
You never know how many centimeters
will be or how long it will last.

450
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,500
The difference between men and
women is too big for me

451
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,200
even begin to understand.

452
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,600
For example, a woman ...

453
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,900
just want to hear three
words of a man, I love you.

454
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,200
A man wants to hear three words
too, but different.

455
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,000
It's so big!

456
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,100
Not?

457
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,800
Assholes!

458
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,600
To me, Big Al is the reason that
abortion should be legalized.

459
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,700
You talk about sex more than
any girl I know.

460
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,500
You are the girl more
so fuck I know.

461
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,000
- Standing next to you makes me horny.
- Go take the tail.

462
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,800
When will drop the Al?

463
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,900
Really? Knock it off, Vic.

464
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,300
Knock it off!

465
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:26,700
We're having fun, right?
Said this at the wrong time.

466
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,100
I'll wait for you.

467
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,000
What do you have in common?!

468
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,600
Weapons. We both love.

469
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,400
The weapons and I are
in love with him.

470
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,900
That is what we have in common.

471
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,000
You're in love with him?

472
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,400
Yes, Vic, I am.

473
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,800
- Sorry, but ...
- No, you know what?

474
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,500
Possession is not love.

475
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,200
Alcoholics do not have love,
they have hostages.

476
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,600
And it does not suit you.

477
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,900
I serve.

478
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,600
I may even treat you like
shit if you like.

479
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,300
Thank you. Come on.

480
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,100
- Hey.
- And there, assholes.

481
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,300
At least someone is
earning a living here.

482
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,900
Look Reilly.

483
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,400
Ass.

484
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,900
Ass and nice.

485
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,900
So dumb it takes 2 hours
to watch the 60 minutes.

486
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,900
- I'll get this tonight.
- Good luck.

487
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,200
She's a dyke.
She likes to suck pussy.

488
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,200
It is a challenge.

489
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,000
I do not eat.

490
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,600
It may not be as
Kat bad if the bears.

491
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,400
What does this mean?

492
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,600
Hi, girls.

493
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,500
- Why are you laughing?
- Let's talk back.

494
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,300
- Reilly, how are you?
- Well

495
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,300
What?

496
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,100
For God's sake. Are
See what I have to endure?

497
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,100
Come on.

498
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm going. Easy.

499
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,100
Can I pay a
beer for you, Vic?

500
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,900
I do not drink.

501
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,800
I am Irish from birth.

502
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,800
Really? What a coincidence.

503
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,500
Reilly, I'm not ...

504
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,100
I was not born in Ireland,
but my family.

505
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,700
My parents have some shoes
Irish first.

506
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,300
My mom makes the best
buoy Irish town.

507
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,100
She makes those sweaters
tiny little cute too?

508
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,700
- Indeed yes.
- Really?

509
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,700
Do so. She must have some
reassembling these sweaters a. ..

510
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,600
the early nineteenth century,
I think.

511
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,600
She knows all the
Irish music.

512
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,100
Danny Boy, etc.. And my father ...

513
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,300
met the guy who invented the
Irish Spring soap.

514
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,900
See?

515
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,700
Everyone in this fucking neighborhood ...

516
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,400
Whipped! You're Irish.

517
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,600
- Relax, eat a potato.
- What?

518
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,800
Sorry.

519
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,300
I'm not feeling
same today. I'm kinda busy.

520
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,300
Do not worry.

521
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,300
What is your nationality?

522
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,300
Jewish.

523
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,200
Jewish? Where is it?

524
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,300
In the Bible.

525
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,000
It must be very old.

526
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,400
Undoubtedly.

527
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,700
- Where are most of the Jews?
- Long Island.

528
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,900
Now we can get out?

529
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,700
I heard you slept
with some women.

530
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,600
What's this?

531
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,500
Nothing.

532
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,500
I also slept.

533
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,200
Really?

534
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,100
Legal, Reilly. Your mother should
be very proud of you.

535
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,400
Now could you please
going home the fucking?

536
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,000
Am I bothering you?

537
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,500
No, I'm always hostile
when you do not like anyone.

538
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,500
I love horror movies.
You like?

539
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,800
I like it.

540
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,800
Maybe go watch one, Friday night,
want to come with me?

541
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,300
Jesus, Reilly!
You are a horror movie for me.

542
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,400
If you play, man. I will not be your next
victim. I'm not interested, okay?

543
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,000
- Why not?
- Why not just want me to draw.

544
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,500
- Not true.
- Is not it?

545
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,200
No.

546
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,700
You're so tough, you know?

547
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,300
Right. Contact a good reason
not to give me.

548
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,800
A good reason?

549
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,800
Do not take it personally,
but not like you.

550
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,800
This is not right.

551
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,700
It's an excuse.

552
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,000
- Incredible.
- It's just an excuse.

553
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,200
You do not even want to.

554
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,700
You want to Kat.

555
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,100
But can not have.

556
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,000
- Do you have a problem there.
- What?

557
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,500
- Al
- Al

558
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,800
Why not kill?

559
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,200
Just get rid of it.

560
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,600
Oh, perhaps
it could be yours.

561
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,100
Al is my friend. I do not do this
sort of thing with friends.

562
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,400
It's just a detail.

563
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,100
Come on, Reilly, be courageous.

564
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,700
Try something new.
Kill a friend.

565
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,800
He does not like yourself.

566
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,900
Always speaks ill of
you behind your back.

567
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Oh yeah?

568
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,500
Type?

569
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,200
Say.

570
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,900
- You're not afraid of him, right?
- No.

571
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800
Get rid of him then.

572
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,600
He thinks you
is a foot-and-shame.

573
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,900
I no longer do things like that.

574
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,900
I am changing.
To follow my religion now.

575
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,600
Following your religion?
How sweet.

576
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,300
It's a bit late for that,
huh?

577
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:19,000
After all this talk, I
to go to the bathroom to vomit.

578
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,400
Wait.

579
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,700
What do I do to eat you, eh?

580
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,800
Come on.

581
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,600
I want you.

582
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,900
Right.

583
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,800
I sleep with you under one condition.

584
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,800
If you get rid of Al

585
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,600
- You are very demanding.
- You should see me in bed.

586
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,700
- You're a good guy, Reilly.
- Thanks.

587
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,000
Think about it.

588
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,600
I'll think.

589
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,900
I'm worth it.

590
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,200
I bet you do.

591
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,000
Now he will turn
a good Catholic boy.

592
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,800
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

593
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,200
If you do, I'll take in the face.

594
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,100
Fuck.

595
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,200
Hey, Reilly, and then?

596
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,400
- You're beautiful.
- Are you drunk?

597
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,800
I want to kiss you right now.

598
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,100
Is not that drunk skunk.

599
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I always wanted
were my girl.

600
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,000
Reilly! Come here.

601
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,300
I'll be there soon. I'm going.

602
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,600
- Daddy's calling, Reilly.
- If you stay with me shooting this neighborhood

603
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,400
You know he will not.

604
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,100
- O'Reilly is a good match.
- Very sexy.

605
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,900
Sexy?
I thought you were in love.

606
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,500
Have dinner request does not stop me
to see what's on the menu.

607
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,000
Do not know if he told you, but I am
one of the special dishes of the night.

608
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,200
Shit! Look who came.

609
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,400
- Fool!
- We talk to never come here.

610
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,000
So?
Want to light my cigarette?

611
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,900
Are you crazy?
What the hell are you doing here?

612
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,900
Give the lighter.

613
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,700
- Why are you so nervous? Hhhh.
- Stay away from me.

614
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,700
Al

615
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,900
Jesus Christ.

616
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,300
- See you around.
- Get your hands off me.

617
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,500
The Puerto Rican is
be rude.

618
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,400
Have to put it in place.

619
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,700
Never mess with
nobody's wife.

620
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,000
- Do not move.
- Never mess with mine!

621
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,100
- What?
- Please sit down.

622
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:11,500
- What have I done?
- Do not be silly, bitch!

623
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,100
- Do not know what I did.
- You know yes.

624
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:20,100
- No.
- I saw you with the Puerto Rican.

625
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,300
It's about that then
Puerto Rican.

626
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,100
He came to me and asked a
cigarette and I told him to fuck off.

627
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,400
- You touched his arm.
- I touched nothing. What are you talking about?

628
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,000
- Do not lie!
- I touched unintentionally, ok?

629
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,800
- Honey ...
- You're drunk.

630
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,300
Come here.

631
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,600
Get up,
your big baby.

632
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,800
- Go fuck yourself.
- You spoke with him e. ..

633
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,100
- Shut up.
- You lit his cigarette e. ..

634
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,700
- Touched his arm ...
- Al, that business ...

635
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,700
Then he tried to touch the chest,
right?

636
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,000
It was not love?

637
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:10,800
- When I saw him looking at her ...
- Could you stop?!

638
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,800
beautiful legs.

639
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,600
You're like a bitch
night with this dress.

640
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,600
You seem like a bitch, huh?

641
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,000
- You bought this dress.
- I seen my girl.

642
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,300
You said I looked like the
inside him, like Faith Hill.

643
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,000
Want to suck my dick right?

644
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,600
Did you suck
his dick too, right?

645
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,200
- Shut up.
- Shut you.

646
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,600
Did you suck
Puerto Rican cock.

647
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,200
- Answer!
- Get off me!

648
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,200
Would you give him,
your white trash.

649
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:47,600
Vic stayed with all night.
The three of you. Bitch bitch.

650
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,900
I saw the way it looked.
You disgust me!

651
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:56,800
Answer a question, ok?
What did he say to you?

652
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,700
- Nothing! He only asked fire!
- Liar!

653
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:06,700
Sorry, honey. Come here.

654
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:13,700
Okay. Just could not stand to see.

655
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,500
You embarrass me
in front of my friends.

656
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,200
How will I maintain
their respect?

657
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:25,800
Reilly said: "Look to your wife
Chat with a Puerto Rican. "

658
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,600
"She wants dick latino." That's
Whatever, fucking whore?

659
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:34,700
Expects me to suck
pussy of Puerto Rican?

660
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,900
Want me to eat pussy
Puerto Rican? Bitch!

661
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,500
How can a
these slutty!

662
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,200
I told his son
motherfucker! I did nothing.

663
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,500
- I was going to fuck it, bitch.
- Stop!

664
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,300
Bitch sucker of Latin!
Stay down!

665
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,600
- Do not move!
- No! Please.

666
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,500
- Stop, please!
- Come here. Cut your face.

667
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,300
- Retail that face.
- Stop!

668
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,900
- Do not move.
- Let me.

669
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,300
I will leave you so ugly
nobody will look.

670
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:19,300
Please, Al

671
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,200
Honey.

672
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:35,400
- He touched his hand.
- He said he liked my hair.

673
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,700
- He said he liked my hair.
- See? You lied.

674
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,400
You lie, you see?
Hiding things from me.

675
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,000
- You understand?
- No, please.

676
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,300
Why not say so before?

677
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,000
- I do not know.
- Come here, baby.

678
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,800
- I never want to see you so.
- Please!

679
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,100
- Listen.
- Please, Al!

680
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,400
I never want to see
you dressed like that.

681
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:08,100
It looks like a slut in that dress.
Tire.

682
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,100
- Please.
- Remove.

683
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,900
Give it here.

684
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,500
Take this shit, ok?

685
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,400
Ok, let's go to the room.

686
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,400
Come to my room.
Let's see what else is there.

687
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,600
Show your other clothes. Strip
clothes from the closet, baby.

688
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,300
- Show me. Give here.
- These clothes?

689
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,000
Clothes are a bitch, baby!

690
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,100
- Look at this shit.
- Please stop, Al

691
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,600
- Clothes are a bitch!
- Do not do it, Al

692
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:55,600
Please, Al, Sorry.
Never talk to anyone.

693
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,900
Shit!

694
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,500
Ok, come here.
Look in the mirror.

695
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,500
Come on, look in the mirror.

696
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,500
You see?

697
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,500
Tell me.

698
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,300
- Say it's a bitch.
- Stop it, Al!

699
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,300
Say it's a bitch!

700
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,700
- I'm a bitch!
- Say you love me.

701
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,900
- Say you love me.
- I love you.

702
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,300
Says he wants to suck my dick.

703
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,000
I want to suck your dick!

704
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:36,800
Honey.

705
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,700
- I'll cut your hair!
- No!

706
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,400
Stay still,
you'll learn.

707
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,400
It is the only way
will learn.

708
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:57,100
It is the only way
will learn.

709
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Come here!

710
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:09,200
I want to spend the rest of my
life with you, your fucking bitch!

711
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:21,300
Al!

712
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:30,600
I'll buy a mirror
new for you tomorrow, love.

713
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,500
No excuse for
treating people like him.

714
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,500
There are people who had a
childhood worse than that of Al,

715
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,700
and end up doing
great things.

716
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,300
Become a
model of citizenship.

717
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,200
As a secretary who knew
who had a horrible childhood. Type:

718
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Too horrible to talk about: Rape;
incest, eating with hands, etc..

719
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:59,900
But he lived with a smile on
face and everything was wonderful.

720
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,700
She was funny. Nothing
like this animal: Al

721
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,500
Death penalty.

722
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:11,000
Shoot him. It has to be
be swift and brutal.

723
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,600
Okay. Okay?

724
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,800
- You have to go, Vic.
- What?

725
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,500
You have to go, why ...

726
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,900
I do not want trouble.
You have to go.

727
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm not going nowhere.
You come to my house with me.

728
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,700
- No.
- What are you doing?

729
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,700
I can not. He turns back
me. You know him.

730
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,800
Do not want to get in trouble
More, please.

731
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,700
I'm scared.

732
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,900
I'll turn it all inside.

733
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,800
I'll be fine.

734
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,700
As can be
with him after that?

735
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,800
I love him.

736
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,800
I love fucking.

737
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,200
This is sick. Love does not
would cause suffering.

738
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,300
- But I love you, Vic.
- It was because of weapons?

739
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:06,000
It was not.
He was just jealous.

740
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,500
- Who is it?
- Reilly.

741
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,500
Do not let anyone enter.

742
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:20,600
Jesus Christ, are you okay?

743
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,600
But what the fuck.
Sit.

744
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,600
It was the Al

745
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,600
Son of a bitch down!

746
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,600
He beats women.
How did this happen?

747
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,400
Do not be so surprised,
was not the first time.

748
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,500
It'll be okay, honey.

749
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,200
Okay nothing
It was you who made him do it.

750
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,100
- Are you one of them.
- How so?

751
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,100
I did nothing.

752
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,400
Al does not work pro

753
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,100
Clancy and other guys did.
I swear. Come here.

754
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,800
- Reilly.
- Easy. It'll be fine.

755
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,000
I do everything I want.
You decide.

756
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,400
It's just bullshit. You all
are full of crap.

757
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,300
I'll get your stuff.

758
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,700
And let's get you out because
can not stay here anymore.

759
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,300
- Come to my house. It will be better.
- I will not go with anyone!

760
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:07,300
I'll wait and when he'll return
break his face in front of you!

761
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,800
- Stay here?
- Honey, okay, sorry.

762
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,300
- Should not have done it, Al!
- Get outta my house!

763
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,000
- Go fuck yourself!
- Do not touch it!

764
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,300
I was playing, you do not
deserve, you bastard!

765
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,300
- So try it!
- Reilly!

766
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,900
- Stop!
- Reilly out of him!

767
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,100
Beware! Come on!

768
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,400
- Look at the fucking gun!
- You're hurting him out!

769
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:39,600
You're hurting,
Reilly, stop!

770
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,800
Oh, my God!
Let Kat, get out there!

771
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,900
They were very noisy.

772
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,200
I'll just say this.
I do not want trouble.

773
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
What happened behind those
doors was not of my business.

774
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:15,400
- Let me see let Al?
- I'm here to help you, and not Al

775
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,100
Think you believe it?
You think I'm stupid?

776
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,900
I know you want me to help you
Al to put in jail forever?

777
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,100
I will not have anything to do with it.
Got it?

778
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:29,300
I do not know what Al did in
past and honestly do not care.

779
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,200
I'm here because I was responsible
his case, to help you.

780
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:36,400
This is my job. Phallus
with battered women.

781
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:41,400
Battered women?
What the hell does that mean?

782
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:47,100
I am a bacon beaten?
What are you talking about?

783
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,500
Come on, Kat.
It's obvious that he hurt you.

784
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,300
He hit me, so what?

785
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,300
He rarely hits me.

786
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,100
This was not a
simple beating.

787
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,400
Will wait until next time,
until you kill him?

788
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:16,200
- It was not his intention?
- Listen.

789
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,700
You can protect yourself.
Talk to me.

790
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,200
Nothing to say
will leave this room.

791
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:26,500
Yeah, right. The
walls have ears.

792
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:30,600
I am not asking
handed over her boyfriend.

793
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,500
Right? Just wondering:

794
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:38,600
As a man who loves a
woman would do this to her?

795
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:43,000
And why a woman
would you be with him?

796
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,400
Needless to say
nothing if not want.

797
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:51,000
We could only stay
sitting here for a while.

798
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,600
He cut my hair.

799
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:06,400
Jesus! It was an accident, okay?
I have not tried to kill her!

800
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,200
Was it murder
the bullet had caught her.

801
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:12,400
But only got grazed. Was a
accident. I never kill Kat!

802
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,200
She sucks better
all in NY.

803
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
- I see you have it in high esteem.
- Okay, look ...

804
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:25,100
If a woman that upon
his face, would not want to hurt her?

805
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,400
Not worth it
by killing anyone.

806
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,800
I think you
Kat never proved.

807
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:35,500
So ... married?

808
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,900
Divorced.

809
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,400
Lonely?

810
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,600
No way. My work
keeps me very busy.

811
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,100
You want to fuck me, right?

812
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,800
It can be hard to believe you,
but I can resist its charm.

813
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,300
You'd be the first.

814
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:04,700
And his girlfriend who is
a point of giving out on you?

815
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,200
What would she say if you
hear talking like that?

816
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,900
Please do not be so dramatic.
I'm not going nowhere,

817
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,500
not to be home.
Home sweet home. Bet.

818
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,300
Kat is not going to complain.
She can not live without me, you dig?

819
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,300
She loves me.

820
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:26,700
- So what do you think of me?
- What is homicidal and psychopathic.

821
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,800
And if you stay on the streets,
'll probably kill someone.

822
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:35,400
- Maybe himself.
- Do not say that or I'll kill you!

823
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,700
What's the matter with you,
you moron! You're tough?

824
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,900
More than me?
If you feel funny, Clancy.

825
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,400
But I know you.

826
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,100
She just said she was talking
with the Puerto Rican.

827
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,600
Fuck you, asshole, I
I know you're a jerk.

828
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,500
A despicable coward with foot odor.

829
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,400
And Kat was beaten by
Because of what you said.

830
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,600
Bullshit. She deserved it.
You can not trust her.

831
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,500
Beware what you say, Clancy.

832
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,200
I'm talking to look after you
life, or get hurt.

833
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,600
- Are you threatening me?
- Fuck.

834
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,600
You do not have
bother me.

835
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:12,600
Has the Kat Reilly, Latinos.
Do you think Jose will leave cheap?

836
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:18,000
Think? I'm talking to fend for himself.
The fish dies by the mouth.

837
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,400
You're not me
leaving scared.

838
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:24,100
I'm not? Then you're retarded!
See you at the morgue, genius.

839
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,700
I do not plan to live
here all my life.

840
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,600
Dream of leaving here.

841
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,400
Al and I have plans to go
to the beach or something.

842
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,900
This year out
but maybe next year.

843
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,300
- Likes the beach?
- Yes.

844
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:45,500
I love the beach. Al has promised to
get a place for us there.

845
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,800
No need for that Al.

846
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,700
You'll be surprised at the
much you can do alone.

847
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,100
- Better stop here.
- Why?

848
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,100
I do not want trouble.

849
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,800
I have neighbors who will talk.

850
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Call me, ok? Come on.

851
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,700
You'll get in trouble.

852
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,100
Slag!

853
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:09,400
What was in my head?

854
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,900
Fucking prick!

855
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:20,500
Someone should have killed Al ago
long. I've thought about it, but ...

856
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:26,200
I could not. We had spent
through a lot together e. ..

857
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,200
Would not it be nice
do this, you know?

858
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,100
It's something in the neighborhood.
We have rules.

859
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:38,000
Of course we fight.

860
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:42,100
We did not go much in agreement
times. Most of the time.

861
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,100
But it would have been nice.

862
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,800
- Hi, trouble.
- Hi

863
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:54,100
- On the house.
- I can not accept anything stolen.

864
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,100
Are you kidding?
I did not steal it, was the Al

865
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,200
Handle at once.
Do not leave me no way, ok?

866
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,700
Okay.

867
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,700
Want to join?

868
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:10,600
- Yes.
- Come in.

869
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,200
- I'll make some toast for you.
- Ok

870
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:20,600
Listen. Al will be free in 24 hours
you have to make a decision.

871
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,100
Make a complaint or get
a court order.

872
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,700
How do you know so much about Al?

873
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:30,300
Because I was married
with a man like him.

874
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:34,400
- Wow.
- I'll show you something.

875
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,200
Jesus Christ.

876
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:45,200
- When was that?
- 6 years ago.

877
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:50,100
After I left,
I returned to school,

878
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,100
I got my diploma.

879
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,800
- You're mad.
- My life has changed for the better.

880
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:02,700
Changed. Leaving it was the
Best thing I ever did.

881
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,400
- I'm afraid.
- You can.

882
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:10,800
He was not afraid
he was behind you?

883
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:18,600
I could not give more
the luxury of being scared.

884
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,300
- Hi
- Hi, Reilly.

885
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,400
Any news?

886
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,700
- No, and you?
- No.

887
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,100
- Beer.
- Ok

888
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,300
Take.

889
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,300
I'll kill him.

890
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,400
I'll kill the bastard.

891
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,500
This must be the thing
smarter than I said.

892
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,900
It's here. Where I live.

893
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,900
Is there another place to live?

894
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,100
Can I stay in the house
my friend Vic, but ...

895
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,000
I do not think that is
a good idea.

896
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:30,600
- Why not?
- Because I get the couch ...

897
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,000
and end up in her bed. Got it?

898
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,400
What?

899
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:42,100
Upset by having you
slept with a girl?

900
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,600
There is ...

901
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,800
No. Why?

902
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,800
I always say: Each one in his.

903
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:55,500
Each one in his.
Also always say that.

904
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,100
Each one in his.

905
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:07,100
You're so tense. Relax.

906
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:13,900
Moreover, it is the end of
block. Not far enough.

907
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:19,000
He could find us
easily there, you know.

908
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:23,300
- You could stay here.
- I could not accept that.

909
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:27,900
No problem.
I have a room.

910
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,000
- I think, thanks.
- Listen.

911
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:36,200
You are a woman with
power and need to use.

912
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,400
Lips, nipples, hips.

913
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,100
You're all woman.

914
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,500
Have to think so.

915
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,400
Use your power of woman
to change your life.

916
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:52,000
- I slept with a woman?
- No.

917
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:59,300
- It's me singing?
- Maybe. Wants me to be?

918
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,700
Mean. Come on.

919
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,900
We're talking "helps"
huh?

920
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:11,400
I'm not helping you
for that reason.

921
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:15,000
And contradicting what you think,
not everyone wants something from you.

922
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,400
I'm doing here
my duty ...

923
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,100
and not to take advantage of you.

924
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,600
I swear.

925
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,100
Really?

926
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:28,000
No thanks. I do not believe
anything you're saying.

927
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,200
Nobody does anything for free.

928
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,800
When I was 9 years ...

929
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:42,600
He told me he wanted
I had never been born.

930
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:48,200
He said
never wanted children.

931
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,600
But he lived in the mood to climb by

932
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,200
Because of his incredible
sexual drive.

933
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:55,900
So he could not
take your hands off my mother.

934
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,000
So I told him ...

935
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
That's no excuse. If not
want children did not.

936
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,800
Has many children
junk out there, right?

937
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,700
Eat your ass bitch.

938
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:13,900
This is my solution pro
birth control.

939
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,600
Turn the bitch and eat my ass.

940
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,100
- How are you?
- Al

941
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,200
I'll call the Vic and Liz,
they are down there.

942
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,800
- And I'll call the police.
- It will not.

943
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,100
You should not be here.

944
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,600
Do not make things more
difficult than they are.

945
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:46,400
I do not want that bitch
Come in here to investigate.

946
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,500
I warn you, okay?

947
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:53,300
Do not want her to come here.
I warn you.

948
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,000
Come here.

949
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,600
I think she never had
luck with men, but ...

950
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,200
she never knew how
keep a man.

951
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:10,300
I, for one, am married and happy
My fourth husband for two years.

952
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,500
It works.

953
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:15,100
Gerdie. Could close this
maw and cook something for me?

954
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,000
Shut your fat mouth!

955
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:21,300
We'll eat when
I want to, ok?

956
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:27,700
I do not know where she got
her problem with men.

957
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,000
Perhaps her father.
He's crazy.

958
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:35,500
Clancy said he saw you talking
with the Puerto Rican again.

959
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,200
- I have not spoken with him, okay?
- I wanted to suck his dick?

960
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,700
- No, I want to suck his dick!
- Admit it!

961
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,900
So why not respond?
You must be thinking?

962
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:49,700
- You have to think?
- No! 're Making me nervous!

963
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:49,800
Right.

964
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,200
It seems I'm the "Million-Dollar Show."

965
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,200
Shit!

966
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:57,900
Go away at the first sign
of a domestic disturbance?

967
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:03,900
- Oh, no Al, Al
- What?

968
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:08,500
Insanity is not a
domestic disturbance!

969
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:13,300
It is a disease that rots.
And you're crazy.

970
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:16,300
- Ok
- Let me go, please.

971
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,100
Promise not to beat
most of you, ok?

972
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,100
You said that last time.

973
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,100
- This time it's for real, ok?
- No.

974
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,100
- I need some time.
- This time it's for real.

975
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,100
I need some time
to think, ok?

976
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,100
- Do not go.
- See if I can forgive you!

977
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,600
- For God's sake!
- Save that shit!

978
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,100
Keep that shit!
You're not going anywhere!

979
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,700
Do not touch me.

980
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,800
- Do not touch me.
- Do not say I can do!

981
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,600
I am your master! Centimeter
by inch, you're mine.

982
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:45,300
- I am your master! Ok?
- Al ..

983
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:49,500
I will ask a court order
to expel you.

984
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,900
- I'm right.
- I got the chick!

985
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:56,500
You do not have any power.
I have. You are a woman!

986
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,200
I make your face to bits
if you request a court order.

987
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,500
You will not be able
come near me.

988
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,100
Or accurate.
Send someone to do.

989
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,400
I'll be sitting
here watching TV.

990
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,100
As your face
is being shredded.

991
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,700
Will I have three witnesses.
Police. My friends.

992
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,100
And when your face
is being punched,

993
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
and you'll be here
have no proof.

994
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,500
So ...

995
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,900
Will be so ugly when
crawl back to me ...

996
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,300
neither will
want to see you anymore.

997
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,400
- Kat, c'mon!
- Sit down.

998
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,700
Neither move.

999
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:39,000
- Kat? Okay?
- What the hell is he doing here?

1000
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,700
He says he came back.

1001
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,400
- Vic.
- She will be with me.

1002
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,700
Listen, Kat. Remember
as we speak.

1003
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:49,000
Can I call the police
now if you want.

1004
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:52,300
- Say you'll stay.
- It'll be fine.

1005
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:57,400
- Put them away from home.
- They could go?

1006
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:01,000
We will reach an agreement.

1007
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,200
I do not want trouble,
ok, please?

1008
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:07,300
- Kat.
- Okay?

1009
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,500
Listen, Albert.

1010
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,600
If hurt, not
I'm your girlfriend.

1011
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:18,200
- I'll kill you.
- I'm scared to death, okay?

1012
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,900
- For really should.
- Your black fucking.

1013
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,800
Get out of my house to
I eat my pussy.

1014
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,800
I swear at what you want.

1015
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:30,700
If you hit it again,
will be between you and me. Got it?

1016
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,800
- Kat?
- Please, go.

1017
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:42,000
It'll be fine. It is a matter
particularly among the people.

1018
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,700
Go fuck yourself!

1019
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:48,400
Do not make me get up.

1020
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:02,600
I married at 18, with a guy who
thought to be a Prince Charming.

1021
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:07,000
- But it was a frog, right?
- Right.

1022
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:12,700
But he tricked me for a while.
Louquinha I was the guy.

1023
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,700
You were young.
Maybe it was just louquinha.

1024
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,300
Or wrong.

1025
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,000
Probably both.

1026
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:22,900
At first it was great.

1027
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:29,200
But then he began to
drink and act like Al

1028
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:36,200
I was 6 months pregnant.
A girl. Tess.

1029
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:41,200
He came home drunk one night
and began to fight over ...

1030
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:45,500
drink all or nothing.

1031
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:50,700
Then he began to
beat me without stopping.

1032
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,700
Somehow, I escaped and
I ran screaming down the hall ...

1033
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,400
and neighbors
called the police.

1034
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:59,800
Again. E. ..

1035
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:03,900
I reached the top of the staircase
and he reached me ...

1036
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,600
He hit me so hard ...

1037
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,500
I fell down the stairs e. ..

1038
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,900
I lost the baby.

1039
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,100
- Sorry.
- Ok

1040
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:30,900
Nor was the place to get
my clothes and things.

1041
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:36,100
It did not come see me at the hospital.
I was so angry.

1042
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:48,200
Men are dogs. One day
will wake up and start barking.

1043
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,100
Right.

1044
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:58,000
But I would love to help Kat
then ... if you think of something ...

1045
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:03,300
- Anything.
- E. ..?

1046
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:07,000
- Let me know, ok?
- Yes.

1047
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:12,200
You're screwing me.
Are you listening?

1048
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:17,600
You fucking bitch!

1049
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:23,900
- Why does not speak my name!
- Al

1050
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,800
- Say it!
- Al!

1051
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,200
What are you suggesting?

1052
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:51,700
If Kat is not strong
enough to drop the Al,

1053
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,700
maybe he needs
Drop it.

1054
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:59,800
- He'll never do that.
- Perhaps not willingly.

1055
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,000
What are you saying?

1056
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,000
You seem to follow the rules and
My suggestion is a bit risky.

1057
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:15,400
- Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
- You bastard. I loved it.

1058
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,000
Go ahead.

1059
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:23,100
A friend of mine has just
with Al for a price.

1060
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,600
Wait.
We have not had that conversation.

1061
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,800
He's not so expensive
can crack.

1062
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:34,400
Crack? We are not
talking about dinner.

1063
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:37,700
You're talking about murder.
You crazy?

1064
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:41,700
It's the only way we get her out
His stay with me for her.

1065
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,600
You are in love with her?

1066
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:51,400
Would do anything for her.
I'm mad about her.

1067
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:53,500
Or maybe it's just crazy.

1068
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,400
Realized that is
talking about murder?

1069
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,200
You said: Who does not
ventured, nothing gained.

1070
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,700
He was talking of arming.

1071
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:03,500
Or something, was not
talking about killing anyone. Christ!

1072
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:07,500
Known me for 2 hours and wants
I'm an accomplice to murder.

1073
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,100
I do not want more.

1074
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Do you think this neighborhood
are above the law, but are not.

1075
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,200
This is not the old west.

1076
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,700
It's what you think.

1077
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,500
Fuck!

1078
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,100
Unleash the Al!

1079
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,200
I think I did not understand something, okay?

1080
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:34,100
Still not finished with him.
Got it?

1081
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,900
- Like it?
- Gives pro spent.

1082
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:52,000
I thought I'd take care of the problem.
What happened? Giving back?

1083
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,400
I thought you would handle it.

1084
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,300
I'm working on it.

1085
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,400
I like you.

1086
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:08,900
Idem.
Despite being a man.

1087
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:16,300
Know. Big Al was a major cause
death in the neighborhood for a while.

1088
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Are you saying that
Many want him dead?

1089
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:23,800
I am saying that we live
a very dangerous neighborhood.

1090
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:29,600
- Everyone has to be careful.
- That's exactly what I say.

1091
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:35,200
Do not let me learn that
Reilly is talking to or Vic.

1092
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,700
I would say I love you very much.

1093
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,400
Do not worry.
I will not talk to anyone.

1094
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:41,000
- If you will not have trouble, ok?
- Ok

1095
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,200
A kiss.

1096
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,700
Right.

1097
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:01,900
I have 2 hours.

1098
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:10,900
- We have two hours.
- Yes, that's all I need.

1099
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:15,400
Hey. I wish I had saved my
first time for you.

1100
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,900
- Really?
- I wanted to be a virgin for you, Reilly.

1101
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,500
Fuck.

1102
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,700
What?

1103
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:27,500
Do anything
to get rid of him.

1104
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:30,100
Do anything
to get rid of him.

1105
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
- Anything?
- Yes, It will get rid of it?

1106
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,900
I promise I'll take care
it for you.

1107
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:38,100
Promise?

1108
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:45,900
I wish I had saved my
first time for you, Vic.

1109
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:50,200
I wanted to be a virgin
you, Vic. You know why.

1110
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:55,600
I can not stand. Every time he would
rings, just think of you, Vic.

1111
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:59,300
Do not take it anymore.

1112
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:04,100
Kat knew exactly what
is doing. She's smart.

1113
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,100
She goes by the numbers.

1114
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,400
Playing. Taking risks.
playing with odds.

1115
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,800
If she wanted something for Christmas.

1116
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:18,000
She talked to 4 people
buy the same thing ...

1117
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:21,200
She estimated that
that one would meet.

1118
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,400
And she was right.

1119
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,000
Nobody has ever climbed
better than you.

1120
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:41,800
- Will do what I want?
- Yes.

1121
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:46,800
She got everybody backpack.

1122
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,800
Not happy
everything is back to normal?

1123
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,700
- Yes.
- I was wrong?

1124
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:08,300
Yes

1125
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:16,700
You always right, Al

1126
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:19,900
- What is it?
- What?

1127
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,000
Right.

1128
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,500
- I love you.
- Me too.

1129
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:36,900
Listen, I want to take you ...
I will return here after dinner.

1130
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:39,800
I want to get a sophisticated place.
Take you out.

1131
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:44,700
No. How come?
We were going to stay here and make dinner.

1132
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,600
- Making big beans.
- I want to take you to ...

1133
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,500
French restaurant
one near the ...

1134
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:51,100
- Near the market.
- Hey, Al ..

1135
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:53,200
- Al
- Where's my jacket?

1136
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:55,000
You know ...

1137
01:10:55,300 --> 01:11:01,100
I have a new fantasy
Crazy that I've been plotting.

1138
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:05,200
And I wanted to experiment with you.

1139
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:08,800
- Okay?
- I think so.

1140
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,900
I know that you love so much.

1141
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,700
- I want that.
- Yeah?

1142
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,600
Ok

1143
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,200
Where's my jacket?

1144
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:22,800
- Why not ...
- The jacket written Big Al?

1145
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:25,800
Do not use the Big Al
I bought a new one, where is it?

1146
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:27,300
Want to Big Al

1147
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,600
Why? There it is.
I bought a new beautiful.

1148
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,500
Come on, honey. For me.

1149
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,000
Ok

1150
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:41,000
The problem is that Al
he never thought big.

1151
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,700
It was always a
foot-and-shame.

1152
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:45,300
But he found
someone Height: Kat.

1153
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:50,400
I'm saying.
That's smart. Tough.

1154
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,400
There was a period in her life in
that every guy who goes out with her ...

1155
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:56,700
changed the name to the complainant
the first 3 weeks.

1156
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,700
I'm not sure?

1157
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:21,100
I really want to change this time,
Fr.

1158
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,700
I'm so tired of
be wrong with my baby.

1159
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:29,100
Want to be a good man, you know?

1160
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:31,500
But I'm saying.

1161
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:36,800
I can not leave it in the pants.
Even when I'm in church praying,

1162
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:40,200
every time I see a girl
beautiful in the hall, I want ...

1163
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:44,800
- I shove down her skirt.
- What do you do?

1164
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:50,700
- Again I pray.
- Thank goodness that triumphs.

1165
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:54,000
- How do you think I feel?
- What are you saying?

1166
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:58,600
A row of women are
kneeling in front of me ...

1167
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,900
open their mouths, put
tongue out,

1168
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:05,600
look at me and say "Ah".

1169
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:10,200
- What do you do?
- Again I pray.

1170
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:13,900
It's sickening. How can you say that?
How can you think so?

1171
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:19,100
These poor girls are looking for you
to have hope and you

1172
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:24,100
want them to suck his dick.
Its fucking disgusting.

1173
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:28,300
I'm just a man, Al
I have a chick under the cassock.

1174
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:34,600
- You will burn in hell.
- I'm no better nor worse than you

1175
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:41,100
You're weak. I hate weakness!

1176
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:51,900
You disappoint me, man!

1177
01:14:55,700 --> 01:15:00,300
Stay away from children, okay?

1178
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:03,400
- It's him!
- Come on, man?

1179
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,400
Get him!

1180
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,400
Put your hands behind your back!

1181
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:09,500
- Fuck!
- What are you doing, Al!

1182
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,100
Fuck you, asshole!

1183
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,900
- Be quiet!
- Do not move!

1184
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:18,000
You're under arrest for
Clancy O'harra murder.

1185
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,700
Do not move!

1186
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:26,600
- You're not going anywhere.
- Fuck!

1187
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,400
It is a mistake!

1188
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,900
Get off me!

1189
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:35,800
- Fuck off.
- Get in there!

1190
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:40,500
What is this attitude not
will get you nowhere.

1191
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,000
Go fuck yourself!

1192
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,300
Get in the car!

1193
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:50,200
- Look at his head.
- Fuck!

1194
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:55,800
He must have done something in life.
He lived in big trouble.

1195
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,000
Then I thought:
"If you're ever in trouble,

1196
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:00,300
then do something
let your mother proud. "

1197
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:05,200
Rob a bank, a post
gasoline. Something worthwhile.

1198
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,100
Want to meet?

1199
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,500
So you have to do something
which obliges them to respect it.

1200
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,800
No matter if you like.

1201
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:16,900
If you fear. Then yes.

1202
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:20,000
Turn headline. Am I right?

1203
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:28,000
I do not believe that finally
got rid of him.

1204
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:33,000
No one can
connect to it, right?

1205
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,500
You are a danger, eh?

1206
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:42,800
You know you like it.
Never thought you did.

1207
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,500
There's nothing sexy
in being afraid.

1208
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:53,000
God.

1209
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:57,900
If you knew that you would know,
would have done anything to you first.

1210
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,600
In sex, you are unique.

1211
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,800
I'll find a way
to reward you.

1212
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:23,000
Kat ... is a doll.

1213
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,800
One of the first bitch.

1214
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,300
And that's a compliment.

1215
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:32,000
- Did not hear anything in the streets?
- I heard nothing.

1216
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:36,200
I want to talk to the mother of Clancy
and find out who was behind him.

1217
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,800
Reilly does not know anything?

1218
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:44,500
Why not go talk to him
in line, gotta get out of here now.

1219
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,500
Why worry?
They have no evidence.

1220
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:51,000
My digital
are in the gun, right?

1221
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:55,400
- How?
- I do not know.

1222
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,000
My lawyer says
the good thing is that ...

1223
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:00,600
I have evidence that was not close
Clancy's house that night.

1224
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,900
I was with you.

1225
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,900
But I do not understand why the guy
who lives downstairs ...

1226
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:08,200
said he saw me leave
running from the building ...

1227
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,300
shortly after 22:45
hearing the shot.

1228
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,700
He said he knows that I was by
he saw my jacket Big Al

1229
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,000
But I lost that shit
jacket weeks ago.

1230
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,300
Anyone could
be using it.

1231
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,800
I do not understand, understand?

1232
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,900
Clancy was dead
I sold the gun?

1233
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,600
No.

1234
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:27,900
He was killed with 45 to
is registered in my name.

1235
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:33,300
- I do not understand.
- Someone is up to me.

1236
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:36,100
- Who?
- I do not know.

1237
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,100
Someone who knows us.

1238
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:44,200
- Are you accusing me?
- No. .. I do not know.

1239
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,300
How do I know.
What the fuck am I saying?

1240
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,300
The good thing is that you are my proof.

1241
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,700
- You're my alibi.
- What proof, Al?

1242
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,300
- Where were you tonight?
- How so?

1243
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:58,600
- Where were you tonight?
- I was with you.

1244
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,800
We were playing at home
deck and watching TV, remember?

1245
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:05,500
You do not want to leave that night,
back after the movie.

1246
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:09,100
I made baked beans with
toast and tuna for me.

1247
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,200
What?

1248
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:15,000
I do not remember.

1249
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:21,200
Do not play games with me.
You're my alibi.

1250
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:24,200
I'm doing
confusion about the date.

1251
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:30,200
- I was with you.
- No. I was with a friend.

1252
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:36,400
And he would swear on a stack that
Bibles. He is very religious.

1253
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:41,000
- You would not do this to me, Kat.
- Want to bet?

1254
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:46,300
- Want to bet?
- Not too late for us.

1255
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:52,600
- Please ...
- Do not beg.

1256
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:56,700
Your ...

1257
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,500
asshole.

1258
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:02,300
I'll kill you,
fucking bitch!

1259
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:08,000
- Sit down!
- You will not regret it!

1260
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:12,800
Listen, for now
I'm in control.

1261
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,500
And he knows how:

1262
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:21,500
hips, lips, teats.

1263
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:24,200
Complete woman.

1264
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:30,600
What are you talking about?
Who you been talking?

1265
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,000
- I want to hear, Al
- I'll kill you.

1266
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:35,900
- Listen well.
- I'll kill you!

1267
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:40,500
You're leaving me with much
anger and you do not want that ...

1268
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:46,100
because I have power.

1269
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:51,400
You will rot here
asshole.

1270
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,400
If I want to.

1271
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:56,200
You understand me, Al?

1272
01:20:56,100 --> 01:21:00,200
You set me up.

1273
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,400
- Do not be so dramatic.
- It was the Vic.

1274
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:07,800
It was Vic, right?

1275
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,500
Wrong.

1276
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:16,500
It was not Reilly. He does not ...

1277
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:19,400
Say it is not climbed with him, okay?

1278
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:24,700
Tell him he did not ask for
you suck his dick!

1279
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:27,100
He did not need to ask.

1280
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,400
I offered.

1281
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:36,300
- Oh, Kat.
- Only ...

1282
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:39,800
Thanks for the haircut.

1283
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,900
I turned someone else.

1284
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,200
- So how did?
- What?

1285
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:48,800
- As armed pro Al?
- There have laid.

1286
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:52,500
Snap out of it.
I know it was you with Kat.

1287
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,300
Not me.

1288
01:21:56,500 --> 01:22:02,300
- He slept with her recently?
- No, and you?

1289
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:06,100
- No.
- Bitch.

1290
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:11,600
- But you still want it too, right?
- To tell the truth ...

1291
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,100
It is too much trouble.

1292
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,400
After all this,
I can never trust her.

1293
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,100
I would be suspicious
all the time.

1294
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,500
It scares me.

1295
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:27,200
He preferred to sleep with
somebody more like you.

1296
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:29,200
Really?

1297
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:30,800
Yes

1298
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:36,100
I never speak much with a woman
without ending up going to bed.

1299
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:37,500
You know?

1300
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:41,200
If you're lucky, you might have
many firsts with me.

1301
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,100
- This is not a game?
- I'm not with games.

1302
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:51,000
- Play pool.
- It would be a new approach.

1303
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:57,600
Become friends
first and then climb.

1304
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:04,400
- Your legs are great, Vic.
- You like it?

1305
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,800
Taste.

1306
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,200
Really.

1307
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:13,100
If you play right can be
back to you within 10 minutes.

1308
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:16,700
- What should I do?
- Shut up.

1309
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,600
I am speechless.

1310
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,400
- What was that?
- What?

1311
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:41,100
You have not cured me.
I am not sick.

1312
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:46,700
Whenever I play in two teams,
and I'ma sucker for redheads.

1313
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,800
Me too.

1314
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:04,800
- How was it?
- It was good.

1315
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:09,200
- Let's get outta here.
- Ok

1316
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:31,600
Then we can get your stuff?

1317
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:35,800
- And take me home?
- No.

1318
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:40,600
No? How so?

1319
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,700
No.

1320
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:49,100
I thought that with Al out of the game
'd stay together.

1321
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,400
I said that?

1322
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:54,300
It was not necessary.
Your body has expressed it.

1323
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:01,000
Whipped.

1324
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:04,700
You got what you wanted and
now is getting rid of me.

1325
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:09,300
- So, it will be Vic and Reilly?
- Not so, ok?

1326
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:14,200
Neither.
I need to be alone. Understand?

1327
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:20,400
So, after all
I've done for you ...

1328
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:26,000
- The reward is just a kiss?
- What happened to you?

1329
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:30,000
And that fucking hips, tits,
lips, woman? Power.

1330
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,200
- Use.
- Stop!

1331
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:36,800
Do not throw my words
in my face! You used me!

1332
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:39,200
I did not take anything from you, ok?

1333
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:41,900
He said I could trust you.
That does not need anything from me.

1334
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,600
And in the end, treated me as
others. Right?

1335
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:48,400
You got what
wanted to take away from me.

1336
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:51,400
So do not be a victim.

1337
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:56,800
Fuck!

1338
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,200
Fuck!

1339
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:03,100
Can not play
people out like that!

1340
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,100
What's happening
with ketchup?

1341
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:34,000
Big Al Pacas climbed well.
He was great.

1342
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:36,900
Until you stop being.
Do not get me wrong,

1343
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,800
when we started out,
was exciting, dangerous.

1344
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:45,800
He was funny, sexy, high.
It made me feel safe. Protected.

1345
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:49,100
But he could not me
protect yourself.

1346
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:54,300
Big Al could give me almost everything in
world, but "almost" was not enough.

1347
01:26:54,400 --> 01:27:00,100
Life is like sex. If you want
exit right, do it yourself.

1348
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,300
Hang out with Big Al ..

1349
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,000
made me realize that
best feeling in the world ...

1350
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:12,000
is taking care of number one here.

1351
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,700
Myself.

1352
