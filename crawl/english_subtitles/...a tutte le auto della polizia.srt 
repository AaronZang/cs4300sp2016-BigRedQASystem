2
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:22,161
Calling All Police Cars...

3
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,719
This shouldn't be so bad. 
Now a shot from the front. Head down.

4
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,724
Look at me...
not at the camera.

5
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,916
Smile, love, smile.

6
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,918
Let's try from this side.

7
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,118
Look forward...
hold it.

8
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,353
Smile. 
Don't you know how to smile?

9
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,666
That's enough.
I want to take a swim.

10
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,330
The water's cold!

11
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,884
- It's freezing!
- You'll catch a cold.

12
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,644
I'm still going in.

13
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,162
Her father thinks It's amusing, but when she
catches the flu, I have to take care of her.

14
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,565
Come on!

15
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,663
Let me help you.
Cold, eh? - No.

16
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,988
Dry yourself well.

17
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,792
Come on. That's enough.

18
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,576
- Get us something to drink.
- We have a maid, clear!

19
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,604
- That's what I meant.
- I'll take care of it, dad.

20
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,364
Thank you.

21
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,201
Your husband is very close
to your daughter, eh?

22
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,783
- Would you like a drink?
- Thank you. A Schweppes, please.

23
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,241
- And you, sir?
- Anything non-alcoholic, thanks.

24
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,618
- Tell me the truth. Wasn't the water cold?
- Not at all.

25
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,309
- And you… the usual?
- Yes, thanks.

26
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,673
- Don't you want anything, Franz?
- A... gin-and-tonic. - OK.

27
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,075
- And you, Doctor? A soft drink?
- Yes, thank you.

28
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,295
It's time for bed, Fiorella.
It's late.

29
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,802
- Walt until the record's finished.
- What? It's late.

30
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,262
What a pain in the butt!

31
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,423
- Good night.
- Please don't go!

32
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,876
- You must go to sleep.
- I'm not sleepy. I get scared at night.

33
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,113
- Scared of what?
- Lots of things. Please turn my night light on.

34
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,150
Very well.

35
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,150
Now sleep. When your father gets home,
I'll come back and turn it off.

36
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,645
- Bye.
- Good night.

37
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,802
- Hi! Fiorella!
- Hi!

38
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,412
Adriana!

39
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,397
- I need a favor.
- I bet you want my homework!

40
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,050
Honestly, I wasn't able to get my
math’s homework finished.

41
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,947
You think you're the only busy
girl around? I'm busy tool

42
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,775
You're such a drag!

43
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,668
So you gave her your homework!
And now she's your best friend?

44
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,546
What do you care?
We're friends… so what?

45
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,751
She's only interested in you
for your homework!

46
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,104
Carla is a real friend:
she's not like you.

47
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,693
Remember: my parents think 
I'm studying at your house tonight.

48
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,672
Tonight? I'm busy.
What if they phone?

49
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,178
Don't worry about it.
They never phone.

50
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,229
Okay, I don't mind. I'll do it for you.
But where are you really going?

51
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,028
If you really were my friend,
you wouldn't ask me that.

52
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,516
Besides, I don't discuss my private life.
Have I ever asked you about yours?

53
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,404
Antonietta, I'm going out.
I don't know when I'll be back.

54
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,880
Make sure Fiorella eats, and
that she doesn't go to bed late.

55
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,541
- See you! - Where are you going?
- To study.

56
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,732
If something happens, where
can I find you?

57
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,404
Adriana's. 
Are you going to play bridge?

58
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,744
- No, it’s something serious.
- Ah, then its poker!

59
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,556
- The car keys...
- Going without a bag?

60
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,836
- I don't feel like carrying one.
- And the books?

61
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,433
What good are books anyway?!

62
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,103
- Good evening, Professor.
- Fiorella isn't back yet?

63
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,693
No. She told the madam that 
she was going to study at a friend's.

64
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,193
And who was the friend?

65
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,386
Adriana, 
I think. She told the madam.

66
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,863
- Is the madam here?
- No, she hasn't returned yet.

67
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,674
- OK.
- Shall I serve supper?

68
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,553
What? I'm not happy that my daughter
isn't back home at this hour!

69
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,461
- No, just get me some whiskey.
- Very well.

70
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,467
- What was the friend's name again?
- Adriana.

71
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,284
Adriana? Probably Formenti's girl.

72
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,325
Here it is.

73
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,722
- It's almost ten!
- Formenti residence. Who's speaking?

74
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,803
Good evening. It's Icardi…
is Fiorella still there?

75
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,314
- Fiorella Isn't here.
- What do you mean?

76
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,153
We haven't seen her today.
We rarely see her these days.

77
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,836
She said that she <i>was</i> studying with
Adriana, and she isn't home yet.

78
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,808
Do you want to speak to Adriana?
Perhaps she...

79
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,782
- Yes, thank you.
- Good evening, Professor.

80
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,104
Adriana, do you know where
Fiorella has gone to study?

81
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,763
- No, I don't know anything.
- Very well. Thank you. Bye.

82
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,749
- Here's your whiskey, Professor.
- She's not there.

83
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,461
- She isn’t there?
- She never went!

84
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,256
But... maybe I heard wrong.
She was talking to the madam.

85
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,143
The madam...
Give me that!

86
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,642
Here she is, the madam!

87
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,546
Emilia! All I ask is for you to take
care of our daughter...

88
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,988
and you go out playing cards!

89
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,264
- Why? Where is she?
- That's what I'd like to know!

90
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,070
- She went to Adriana's.
- I called. She never went.

91
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,284
Carla... nobody there.
Mirella... no, not her.

92
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,919
Where can she be?
Where can she be?

93
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,146
If she was at one of her friend's, 
She would've called by this hour.

94
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,836
- What could've happened to her?
- I don't know, I don't know!

95
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,196
You say she left without her purse?
No documents, nothing...?

96
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,054
- No, she left without her purse.
- No purse... this is terrible!

97
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,271
What can we do? Should we call
the hospitals? The Red Cross?

98
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,198
I'll call Mordini.

99
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,809
- What is It? 328... what is It?
- Yes...

100
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,851
Don't cry!

101
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,806
- Hello?
- I want Congressman Mordini.

102
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,268
He's not here... I don't know.

103
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,500
This is Professor Icardi…
Try to find him immediately.

104
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,891
I'll be expecting his call.
Yes, yes, I'm at home.

105
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,606
- Sorry, what was your name?
- Icardi. Professor Icardi.

106
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,422
- Find him quickly.
- Maybe tomorrow morning.

107
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,186
No, no, it's important.

108
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,705
I'm Marshall Attardi, of the mobile squad.
I was told to contact you.

109
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:25,042
Yes, one moment. Chief, he'll
only speak to you.

110
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,359
Yes, Dr. Carraro, Chief
of Police. Talk to me.

111
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,844
Professor, first you've got to give
me some information...

112
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,727
The name of the girl, 
age, hair and eye color...

113
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,930
Who is that arsehole?

114
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,436
It must be somebody Important.
The Chief is giving him his full attention.

115
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,370
Very well, Professor. 
I'll call you. Goodbye.

116
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,407
Start with the normal searches:
hospitals, hangouts and so forth.

117
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,823
If you find anything, 
call me at any hour.

118
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,228
Half two...

119
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:16,012
Why are you wearing that damn hat?
Take it off!

120
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,734
Like usual, 
you blame me for everything.

121
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,633
- Coffee, madam?
- No... yes, okay. Thanks.

122
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,069
- Pour me some too.
- OK, Professor.

123
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,823
Doing nothing drives me crazy.

124
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,884
What are the police doing?

125
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,363
Nothing new, Professor.
We would have called you.

126
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,045
Of course, Professor.
Good night.

127
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,757
Excuse me, Chief, but Icardi called again.
You know, Congressman Mordini': friend.

128
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,151
Yes... no news from the street units,
the hospitals... nothing.

129
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,175
Okay, I'll alert the squad cars to be
on the lookout. Goodnight.

130
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,701
If this happened to a girl from
my neighborhood...

131
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,112
they would have lust sent two detectives,
and case closed!

132
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,693
But Instead this Professor Dickhead
tells a congressman...

133
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,014
and the whole force is out looking
for this runaway.

134
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,919
But, she's just a girl of 16 years of age.
I think it's right.

135
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,933
What do you mean Tight'? 
Why 'yes' for her and 'no' for others?

136
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,734
Is your son home alone?

137
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,335
It's nothing new; 
the nanny comes at seven.

138
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,792
Poor little boy. I'm sorry, but...

139
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,962
Fine, just shut up. 
Don't say anything!

140
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,862
What could have happened
lo my little girl?

141
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,500
Well, Ma'am, we can exclude her from
being the victim of an accident.

142
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,299
But we're still conducting a
city-wide search for her.

143
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,941
- We must start looking at other possibilities.
- What other possibilities?

144
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:47,730
Two, in particular: a kidnapping, considering
the high profile of Professor Icardi.

145
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,497
Incidentally, have you received any
strange phone calls recently?

146
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,254
No.

147
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,371
There is also a problem with this option...

148
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,944
Your daughter said she went to a friend's.
But that wasn't true.

149
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,142
This means she went elsewhere.

150
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,812
Professor Icardi. Is a professional
who works very hard...

151
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,749
hospitals, clinics... but he's not rich
enough to be a target.

152
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,386
Tell the truth!
I'm sure it's because of the money.

153
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,031
- The clinics, the deals, the Investments...
- Why are you talking?

154
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,681
You don't even care about our daughter!

155
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,941
Excuse me, madam, sir.
There's another possibility.

156
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,136
Perhaps your daughter 
left home voluntarily.

157
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,579
Don't make me laugh, detective.
“Left voluntarily”?

158
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,446
It happens every day, in every
type of neighborhood.

159
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,048
Teenagers today are so unpredictable.
They don't know what they want.

160
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,182
What are you trying to say?
Fiorella is only a little girl.

161
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,943
There's a bond of confidence between my
daughter and I. There is dialogue!

162
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,161
I'm just suggesting possibilities.

163
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,004
Do you have a photo of Fiorella,
and could we see her room?

164
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,541
- You go and take a look.
- Madam, would you accompany me, please?

165
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,955
- Thanks.
- What are you showing him?

166
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,032
Excuse me! A picture from
three years ago?

167
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,622
Madam, could you please show us
Fiorella's room?

168
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,603
You're starting off on the wrong
foot, detective.

169
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,514
We must start by going down every
path, until we find the right one.

170
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,803
We can't exclude any possibility.

171
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,471
This is her savings book.

172
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,036
A million and a half...
that's a nice sum!

173
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,780
Well, she deposits her allowance,
plus gifts and suchlike.

174
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,206
For her birthday, 
we gave her 100’000 lire.

175
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,986
There haven't been 
any recent withdrawals.

176
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,813
The swimsuit that belongs in this
bag isn't here...

177
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,950
these are all different brands.
Do you know anything about this, madam?

178
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,934
No... I've no idea.

179
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,727
When she needs something, she just
goes to the boutique.

180
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,902
- Are these Fiorella's designs?
- Yes, she made them.

181
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,227
But now her drawings have changed.

182
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,496
Here's her latest.

183
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,360
Strange...

184
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,693
Yes.

185
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,473
Madam, excuse me, but can you tell
me how she was dressed today?

186
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,136
She was wearing blue jeans, a shirt,
and a beige sweater.

187
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,282
- Here, is this OK?
- Yes, I'd say it was perfect.

188
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,188
Yes. Make 100 copies 
as soon as possible.

189
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,942
- And distribute them to all squad cars.
- Of course. Goodbye.

190
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,959
- Do you have an Idea?
- Sure. Professor Icardi is a son-of-a-bitch,

191
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,034
full of shit, with dirty money hidden away.
I'd like to throw him to the wolves.

192
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,112
- I was talking about the case.
- Yes, true.

193
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,015
The girl left on a moped, 
and bikes need petrol, right?

194
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,409
This is Solmi, what's up?

195
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,885
A customer at a petrol station 
Recognizes the girl from the photo.

196
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,193
- Near Tuscolana, at 10km.
- Alright, I'm on my way.

197
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,453
- Yes, I already told them.
- I want to double check.

198
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,745
Sometimes, people make mistakes,
and are afraid to change their statements.

199
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,818
I'm sure.

200
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:56,184
- What color were her eyes?
- I don't know. I don't remember.

201
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,649
Good. It's difficult to remember,
but liars talk anyway.

202
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,330
You've proven you're not a liar.

203
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,339
She arrived pushing the bike.
She'd run out of petrol.

204
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,403
She put her hands in her pockets,
and said “Oh God! I've got no money...

205
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,307
I gave her a liter, and told her
to pay when she returns.

206
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,794
But then 
she found 200 lire in her pocket.

207
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,599
Sure. So she wasn't going very far...

208
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,388
Listen: 
do you recall seeing her before?

209
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,995
- Yes, I've seen her before.
- Do you know what direction she normally takes?

210
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,525
That way, heading out of Rome.

211
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,996
The Icardi’s live here, near Aurelia.

212
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,628
The girl crossed all of Rome,

213
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,678
and refilled in Tuscolana.

214
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,481
But where was she heading?

215
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,479
At this point, Giovanna's Idea seems
to be most probable, that is...

216
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,768
the girl was wearing her swimming
costume under her clothes.

217
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,320
We found an empty bag, 
but no costume.

218
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,494
And where would a girl go with a
swimming costume? To the beach.

219
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,360
She was heading east, not west.

220
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,898
A pool, a private house,
or a bath house?

221
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,050
Why would she wear it under her clothes?
Couldn't she have changed anywhere?

222
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,021
Perhaps she was going to a lake,
or a swimming club up north.

223
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,523
But I think she was heading towards
the lake... God knows!

224
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,093
There are lots of maybes, 
and too many variables.

225
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,660
We should consider all the possibilities:
a kidnapping, revenge...

226
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,735
let's not forget, 
Icardi is a famous surgeon.

227
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,951
Perhaps one of his 
patients ended up dead...

228
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,906
and the family hold him 
responsible for the death?

229
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:34,715
I know it's not a great theory, 
but there're lots of obstacles out there.

230
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,974
Why are we excluding the possibility
that the girl just ran away?

231
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,166
Look at the family!

232
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:45,224
In that case, she would have taken something
with her, and her savings are untouched.

233
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,556
We'll keep working away at It and
check the area near the lake.

234
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,396
What have you got against
Professor Icardi?

235
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,519
If he doesn't co-operate, it's because
you don't seem concerned.

236
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,182
But I've been patient with him!

237
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,511
Anyway, 
I don't like that type of people.

238
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,714
I don't know... 
perhaps it's because he's a doctor.

239
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,913
When I had my accident, 
I waited four hours for a doctor!

240
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,156
While I was waiting, 
my wife was dying.

241
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,543
Fine, but don't hold it 
against all doctors.

242
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,593
If I'd have got hold of one of them
back then, I would've killed them.

243
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,870
Your attack dogs put on an
impressive show.

244
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,578
They understand every command
with absolute obedience.

245
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,149
Sure; you treat the dogs better
than the officers!

246
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,986
Did you come here just to argue?

247
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,039
No. I need a few good dogs 
for a search.

248
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,259
You can use the unit here.
They're the best.

249
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,863
They can find a track at
a kilometer’s distance.

250
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,272
Okay, that's enough. Let them go.

251
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,439
Here, look!

252
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,219
It's like trying to find a
needle in a haystack.

253
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,386
Every Sunday, thousands of
people leave things behind.

254
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,641
- Come on!
- Do you want to leave?

255
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,575
- No, we'll see it through.
- Okay.

256
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,130
Let's walk on the other side.

257
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,107
If Fiorella was meeting up with someone,
she wouldn't want to be seen.

258
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,321
She would've done It In the
quietest area, right?

259
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,241
That's true...
Come in, Sebastian, do you hear me?

260
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,170
Yes, I hear you.

261
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,169
Let's check over this way.

262
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,707
You guys check over there.

263
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,321
Sergeant, over here!

264
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,127
Take them <i>away.</i> You know
what a mess they'll make.

265
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,448
Fernando, 
come and have a look at this.

266
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,550
We'll take this to the lab right away.

267
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,992
There's no doubt: it's blood.

268
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,184
The reaction is positive:
it's hashish.

269
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,716
Before being dumped in the water,
she was shot in the neck.

270
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,995
When they told me she wasn't
interested in fellow students,

271
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,662
I knew immediately that a
man was involved.

272
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,304
It's an ugly story. What a bastard…
shooting her in the back!

273
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,524
Killed In cold blood, like a
clog, get it?

274
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,676
First they smoked some hashish,
then he shot her.

275
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,799
- A real execution.
- It's probable.

276
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,873
Search the woods, naturally,
for the gun.

277
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,052
After killing her, the creep
tied her to the moped,

278
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,123
and then dumped her in the water,

279
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,149
tied to It to make her disappear.
We must find this pig!

280
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,055
My little girl!

281
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,018
No, don't go.

282
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,313
Take care of this.
You know what to do.

283
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,573
See if there's anything In her
blood: alcohol, drugs...

284
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,518
Yes, I know. The obvious things.
See if she was violated.

285
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,033
Keep in touch with the lab boys.

286
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,589
We need to find the gun...

287
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,126
if the killer is not a criminal,

288
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,101
then It's possible that the gun will be
registered, and will lead us to him.

289
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,526
Also, take time to search the
woods and lake, okay?

290
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,589
Let's begin.

291
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,579
I see no evidence of drug abuse.

292
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,177
If she took drugs, she didn't
use needles.

293
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,885
She's a little girl! Why would you
think she used drugs?!

294
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,678
They're starting younger and
younger these days!

295
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,466
Death was caused by a gun shot.

296
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,465
The bullet penetrated the cranial area,

297
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:03,487
entering under the skull,
and is still lodged in her head,

298
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,839
in the lower right side of the brain.

299
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,882
It seems to be a 7-65 caliber.

300
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,420
Can you bag that please, and pass
it on to the lab boys?

301
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,047
For the moment, I want to know
if she was violated.

302
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,896
I told you: 
there's no evidence on her body.

303
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,181
I understand. I mean carnal violence.
Was the girl a virgin?

304
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,920
Examination of the uterus demonstrates...
evidence of pregnancy. About three months.

305
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,340
Certainly not a virgin!

306
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,449
- It's not true! My daughter...
- Andrea!

307
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,701
Don't you dare? Don't you dare?
mention my daughter’s name!

308
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,627
- Calm down, remember...
- Remember!

309
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,959
I understand, but the autopsy
proved it conclusively.

310
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,932
- But only up to a point.
- Who was her doctor?

311
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,378
My daughter 
has never needed a doctor.

312
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,449
I always took care of her.

313
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,761
We need to know the environment
your daughter lived in.

314
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,309
Names of clubs, pools, schools...

315
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,336
If it helps, my daughter attended
the international school.

316
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,338
And you can't tell us anything else?
Anything that may help, a suspect?

317
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,321
No, nothing.

318
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,048
Maybe your wife will be more helpful.

319
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,975
Leave her alone.
She has nothing to tell you.

320
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,165
- Doctor Marini??
- Yes?

321
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,313
- Listen, I need to talk to Mrs. Icardi…
- You can't.

322
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,822
Why? Is she sick?

323
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,622
Ah, you're a police officer...
then I should say she's feeling better than me.

324
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,618
Excuse me, but If she's fine then
why can't I see her?

325
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,235
Who knows? I don't know.
I don't know, with the information I get!

326
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,834
- Are you offering coffee?
- Of course.

327
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,810
Do you know how much I make?
700’000 lire a month.

328
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,338
And I'm <i>always</i> working.
Luckily for the boss and patients.

329
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,150
Does the clinic belong to the Professor?

330
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,408
Him and his partner Amirato,
another bandit!

331
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,344
They earn millions, and give the
patients the cheapest treatment available.

332
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,935
He's more of a loan profiteer
than a great surgeon!

333
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,542
Do you know 
what his scientific methods are?

334
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,881
To be an Intimate friend
of a big politician...

335
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,306
five-term ministers and
influential congressmen.

336
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,562
But now he's paying for it.

337
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,110
More accurately, 
his daughter paid for it.

338
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,111
And how do you think she would
have turned out?

339
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,539
She would have never survived
parents like that!

340
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,303
Yeah, listen: will you let me speak
to Mrs. Icardi?

341
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,721
What, so I can get the sack?
Thanks for the coffee.

342
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,561
You're welcome.

343
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,148
Listen, excuse me. Get me a nurse.
I need to take a piss.

344
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,476
- Good day.
- What is it?

345
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,306
Excuse me. I need information.

346
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,425
- Come on In.
- Thank you.

347
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,628
I need an operation and I
wanted to see the place.

348
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:11,090
Are you blind? It’s disgusting. 
There's no room, no sheets, no medicine.

349
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,232
But what about the surgeons…
are they good?

350
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,835
Some say they're good, some say.
They're butchers!

351
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:22,402
And what about Professor Icardi?
I've seen him talk on TV.

352
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,971
- Oh, he talks good.
- And as a doctor?

353
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:31,459
He's lust like all the rest:
sometimes good, sometimes bad.

354
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,818
- Can I talk to the Professor?
- He's not here today.

355
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,002
Since the mess with his daughter,
he doesn't come as often.

356
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,001
- What happened?
- Somebody killed her, or she killed herself...

357
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,528
In that family, who knows?

358
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,060
Who's that? - The Professor's
assistant, Professor Giacometti.

359
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,186
- Does he operate too?
- He's always in the operating room.

360
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,243
- Excuse me.
- Listen, excuse me...

361
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,471
my friend had an operation here
on Thursday afternoon.

362
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,970
Was it done 
by him or the Professor?

363
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,769
He has something wrong 
with his gall bladder?

364
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,227
On Thursday? That would've been Giacometti.
He was here till ten that night.

365
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,909
- Thursday… are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure!

366
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,957
It was one of my kid's birthdays.

367
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,782
When I got home, 
there wasn't any cake left!

368
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,275
I was just speaking 
to Congressman Mordini.

369
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,763
This business with Icardi. 
Is a delicate situation.

370
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,946
We don't want 
the press getting involved.

371
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,252
At least, 
not with the sordid aspects.

372
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:38,265
It would only hurt the family further.

373
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,540
Don't you agree, commissioner?

374
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,780
- I'll say as little as possible.
- Listen: use maximum caution.

375
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:58,057
The journalists must believe that
it was an accident.

376
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,889
The journalists aren't naive.

377
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,896
If they think we're hiding facts,
they'll start digging deeper.

378
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,690
Icardi is well known.

379
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,159
You can imagine the spectacle.

380
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,252
And it would be politically disastrous.

381
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:18,350
You see, my dear Carraro, we're only
recommending maximum caution,

382
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:25,226
I know I can count on you.
I wanted to ask you...

383
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,210
Officer Solmi 
seems like a good policeman,

384
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,285
- but he's not very discrete.
- I fully support Solmi.

385
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,538
Sure, sure. But...

386
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,793
but we want you to head the
investigation.

387
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,184
Listen, Chief Carraro, this
is a delicate situation.

388
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,125
- It's not a good time to take risks.
- Solmi is an excellent officer.

389
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:58,775
Sure, but remember: I'm holding
you personally responsible.

390
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,465
- Have I made myself clear?
- Okay, okay.

391
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,808
I never dodge my responsibilities.

392
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,348
It's mine! Good clay,
Mr. Secretary.

393
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,580
- Good day!
- Good day.

394
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:31,845
I'm from the police... I'm here about
the girl found dead in the lake.

395
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,150
- I didn't see anything.
- You're here every day?

396
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,468
Yes, yes.

397
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,411
Look at this photo. Have you
seen this girl here?

398
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,737
Never seen her before.

399
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:49,461
Listen, she came on a moped
and went clown that hill there.

400
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,319
She <i>was</i> with a car. 
You don't remember anything?

401
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,493
A lot of people drive around here.

402
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,430
- Cigarette?
- Yeah.

403
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,662
- Thanks.
- Try to remember.

404
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,246
That girl was murdered, understand?

405
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,930
I mind my own business,
not other peoples!

406
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,799
<i>Why don’t you try Momma'?
He might know summing.</i>

407
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,714
Who's Momolo? Why might he
know something?

408
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:26,574
He's always around... here and there.
Go into town and ask for him.

409
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,597
I only know him by sight.

410
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,920
The bill, please.
We'll leave after coffee.

411
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,909
Wait here.

412
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,698
Momolo, a bill for you!

413
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:59,891
Here.

414
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,758
- You're killing me with everything you eat.
- She was hungry!

415
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,154
Listen: don't go to the same
spot as before. - Why not?

416
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,323
About 100 meters further,
there's another grassy area.

417
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,254
Try it there; it should be better.

418
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,880
More salt!

419
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,989
- Are we safe here?
- Yes, hurry up.

420
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,161
- Enrico Tummoli??
- Yes.

421
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,107
I'm from the police.
Come with me; we need to talk.

422
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,221
Here's a photo of the girl who
was found dead in the lake.

423
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,516
I was told you may have seen her.

424
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,364
- Who told you that?
- Answer me! Did you see her or not?

425
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:47,059
- I only go to the lake to fish.
- What were you fishing for today?!

426
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,947
I was only there for a moment;
I was looking at the water.

427
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:55,251
- Let's continue. Did you see her or not?
- Yes. Sometimes she visited the lake.

428
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,403
She'd arrive on a moped,
then she'd meet somebody.

429
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,743
A man? Did you get a good look?
What did he look like?

430
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:08,995
- Around thirty, or forty.
- Tall, fat, what?

431
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,439
- Average.
- And his car?

432
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:18,982
The oar? The oar was big, a
light color. Foreign plates.

433
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,222
- Do you remember the type of car?
- I don't know anything about cars.

434
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,260
- Did they come often?
- Every week, more or less.

435
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,523
- Since when?
- Four of five months.

436
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,591
What did they do 
when they came here?

437
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,819
They would fuck 
like crazy in the car.

438
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,706
Two days ago, when she was killed…
you were watching?

439
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,319
What did you see?

440
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,563
I didn't see anything.
I wasn't there that day.

441
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,098
I may have some other questions;
make sure I can find you.

442
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,740
I can't tell you anymore.
I wasn't there.

443
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,094
He's been convicted 
of public indecency...

444
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,229
and has had various charges
of child molestation.

445
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,931
Interesting, this Enrico Tummoli…

446
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,839
He's a peeping tom and a flasher.
The murder is the real crime.

447
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,751
Would It be the first time a
pervert killed someone?

448
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,821
An Individual with his record ls
already a potential murderer.

449
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,703
- The girl was killed with a gun.
- It's not difficult to come by one these days.

450
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,326
Even young kids are robbing
people with guns.

451
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,106
Don't forget the evidence of
the tire tracks.

452
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,647
It's a place where lovers go to make out.
Who knows how many may have been there?

453
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,962
How do you think a girl like her,
from a well-off family, a good student,

454
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,043
could get Involved with someone
like that? He's just a lonely old man.

455
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:38,398
She could have had 
a relationship with some kid.

456
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,779
Tummoli...? Watched, became 
Obsessed and attacked her.

457
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,111
No... I'm not convinced;
the girl was pregnant.

458
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,844
I want a search warrant 
for Tummoli's house.

459
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:54,162
He's a suspect and I want to see
if we find a firearm.

460
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,333
If we find the gun, 
the case is closed.

461
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:00,513
Yeah, it would be great for everyone 
if he were the killer... excuse me.

462
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,219
- Marshall, there's nothing here.
- Alright, that's enough.

463
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,948
What are you looking for?
At least tell me that much.

464
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,764
If you don't come clean,
this story isn't over.

465
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,029
Let's go.

466
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:44,214
What are you doing here?
This is my house. Get out!

467
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,919
Here's the report on the 7-65.

468
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,214
The bullet tells us nothing
if we can't find the gun.

469
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:07,355
Let's move on to the tire tracks.

470
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,494
They're Michelin tires, but considering
that it's a public place...

471
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,318
as proof 
it's worthless in a murder case.

472
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,891
Though, from the tracks it's clear
that it was a big car.

473
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,827
Now we move on to something
more concrete...

474
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:21,196
this could assist the case, 
or maybe not.

475
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,437
On a tree trunk, we found
this thread of fabric.

476
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,704
It seems to be from a
beige color jumper.

477
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,644
The microscopic examination
revealed some particles.

478
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,631
We identified them as chalk,
or plaster.

479
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,938
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

480
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,321
Of course, 
it could belong to someone else.

481
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,267
But the chalk reminds me of a
blackboard in a school.

482
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,465
So it could belong to the girl?

483
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:46,316
No, absolutely not.
They don't match the girl's clothes.

484
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,220
Nothing else of interest?

485
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:52,512
We found a key, a biro
beside the hashish.

486
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,261
You didn't know anything about
Fiorella's relationships?

487
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,547
No. Until last year we were close
friends, then Fiorella...

488
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,785
So we can presume it wasn't
someone from the school?

489
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,733
Certainly.

490
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,475
What about a teacher, a coach,
or an administrator?

491
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,499
- Why are you laughing?
- She wasn't a lesbian. All the teachers are women!

492
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,800
- All of them?
- Yes.

493
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,850
There are no men in the school,
not even in the office?

494
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,769
No. He's the only man here.

495
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,825
Excuse me, my ride is
waiting for me.

496
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,541
I still have a few more questions.

497
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,723
I didn't even know her.
Ask her… it'd be better. Bye!

498
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,284
Alright. Think It over and If anything
comes to mind, call me.

499
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,511
Stop! Stop!

500
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,252
Keep her in sight, but keep
your distance.

501
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,939
- 39 calling station, 39 calling station.
- Yes, speak.

502
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,925
Can you put me in contact
with detective Solmi?

503
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,269
<i>Yes? This is Solmi.</i>

504
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:53,945
Fernando, I'm talling a white
Mercedes, 4145XF.

505
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,127
<i>Very interesting, but what do you
want me to do about it?!</i>

506
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:00,023
I was In front of the school, when this
car passed without stopping.

507
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,305
It stopped a block away.
A girl called...

508
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:07,302
Carla from Fiorella's class lumped
in and took off in it.

509
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,918
<i>Give me your position every
five minutes.</i>

510
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,820
<i>I'll switch 
with you as soon as I can.</i>

511
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,891
Good, over.

512
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,044
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.

513
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,154
Remember I told you I couldn't
come today?

514
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,726
You come when I tell you, got it?

515
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:50,796
Unit 14 continues to trail the
Mercedes at 125th.

516
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,063
<i>Alright, over.</i>

517
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,345
<i>Private road
Access forbidden</i>

518
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,618
They entered a villa.
What should we do?

519
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,978
<i>Don’t Let them out of sight,
but stay hidden.</i>

520
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,490
Alright, received.

521
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,825
<i>I want you to film what's
going on inside.</i>

522
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,290
These are young girls!

523
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:12,712
Get used to It. certain people
have unusual tastes.

524
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,738
- Here, stop.
- That's the girl from the school.

525
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,417
- That's the same girl as on the film.
- Yes, of course.

526
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,965
Attardi, get moving.

527
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,871
I don't care about my parents.

528
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,952
But if they find out, they'll
send me to boarding school.

529
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:01,931
We'll try to keep your name out
of this dirty story.

530
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,711
But you must co-operate. Look at these
photos... recognize anybody?

531
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,214
This one. I saw him inside.

532
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,234
- But... are you sure?
- I have a good memory.

533
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,447
But don't you know who this is?

534
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,569
I don't know. Franz told me to meet
him the other afternoon.

535
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,000
The madam told me to behave for...

536
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,971
a very Important client, and that he
would give me an extraordinary gift.

537
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,550
So I went, and she took me
to Franz's office.

538
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,987
- Good day.
- Hello.

539
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,484
- You're cute. Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks.

540
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,402
- Can I play a record?
- Sure, go ahead.

541
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,623
Can you explain why you do it?
You don't seem forced into it!

542
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,291
- At first, no.
- Then why?

543
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,641
For me it's all the same.
Why not get paid for it?

544
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,337
But you don't need the money.
You're not poor.

545
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:31,053
- A little money is always good, right?
- Did Fiorella frequent that house?

546
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:36,245
You know very well who I'm talking about:
Icardi, your classmate.

547
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:39,557
No, I can swear Fiorella never
went to that villa.

548
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,127
- She wasn't in the prostitution ring?
- I never saw her at the villa.

549
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,879
However, I did see her at
our gynecologists.

550
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,735
Ah... and why did you go there?

551
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:52,282
I've never had any trouble, but one time one
of the girls had to have an abortion.

552
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,850
Afterwards, they sent us all for IUD's.

553
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,025
- Who sent you there? Franz?
- Yes, Franz.

554
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,078
- What was Fiorella doing there?
- I wouldn't know.

555
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:02,243
We're leaving now. Give us the name 
And address of the gynecologist.

556
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,878
- And make sure you don't tell anyone about It.
- All right.

557
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:15,042
Hey, get out of here! You can't come in.
This is private property.

558
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,838
Calm down. Let's see some ID.

559
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,137
Cuff him.

560
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,398
- Are there any other exits?
- No, but there's a guard on the other side.

561
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:35,580
Hurry… surround the house.
You can come with me.

562
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,996
Let go of me! You're hurting me.
I haven't done anything.

563
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,323
Open up, 
or we'll break down the door.

564
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:00,008
What do you want? What right do
you have? Where is your warrant?

565
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,691
- Okay, take her away.
- Son-of-a-bitch!

566
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,408
Down there!

567
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,686
The gun.

568
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,089
Come on, get dressed.

569
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,251
What sluts! Let's go.

570
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,586
Quick! Hun-y up!

571
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,013
We were just talking, really.

572
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,595
Just talking, half naked?
Get dressed, you clown. Move!

573
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,680
Idiot!

574
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,723
- You're Franz Pagano?
- Yes, detective.

575
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,913
But I won't say anything else, naturally.
I want to see my lawyer.

576
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,759
- Nobody has ever treated me like this!
- There's always a first time for everything.

577
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,195
Check those numbers.
You'll be surprised.

578
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,072
“Big money"…

579
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:11,425
Usually, 
the police are more understanding.

580
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:25,834
A minor... 
you'll get at least 10 years.

581
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:29,162
For the love of God! That's Gluseocina
Strombelli, 21 years old.

582
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,050
She is the youngest for our clients.
Here, have a cigarette.

583
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,975
I have proof that there are
minors in this place.

584
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,237
Detective... look at this.

585
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:44,061
Open it up. You have no choice...

586
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,236
or I'll do it myself, with a blowtorch.

587
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:53,310
Very well. Here you go, detective.
You do it.

588
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,719
Baking soda.

589
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,442
A 7-65.

590
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:28,922
Sometimes Fernando is so insubordinate
We've been waiting for a century!

591
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,868
- The traffic...
- The traffic is bad for everybody!

592
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,815
But we're still here on time!
Why should we wait on him?

593
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:39,919
Let's start.
Give me those damn files.

594
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:44,375
Let's start with Enrico Tummoli...?
the famous witness.

595
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:48,092
He could be something else,
this psychopath.

596
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,026
We've had him 
under strict surveillance.

597
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:53,294
These are the frequent guests
at Icardi's house.

598
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,750
Now, if Tummoli's testimony is accurate...

599
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:01,914
we're looking for a man who's between
thirty and forty years of age,

600
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,911
medium size... it's all so vague.

601
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,264
Perhaps like this Giacometti.

602
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:11,447
He's the son of a Swiss consul.
Married to Ammirato's daughter.

603
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,320
He has shared business Interests with
his father-in-law and Icardi,

604
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,754
and he's also his assistant.

605
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:19,991
But he's also involved 
in money trafficking.

606
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:23,885
Save that for the scandal sheets.
We're interested in the murder.

607
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,833
Thursday the 14th, the day of the
murder, he was in the clinic.

608
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,581
He operated until ten that evening.

609
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:34,425
Then there's this one, some kind of playboy
who frequented the house. Franz...

610
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,995
We were just talking about you.
You're late!

611
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,789
I know, you've been waiting a century!
But I haven't just been holding my dick.

612
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:46,397
Anyway, we were talking about
a specific individual,

613
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,381
Sure, Franz Hekker.
I arrested him this morning.

614
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:58,135
Franz Hekker, alias Francesco Pagano.
Born in Amsterdam, the 24th June 1936.

615
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:01,260
Father Italian, Vittorio Pagano,
mother Heater Hekker.

616
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,669
Arrested three years ago 
for drug trafficking.

617
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:04,806
Interesting.

618
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,974
Arrested In '71 on prostitution
related charges,

619
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,076
case dropped 
due to lack of evidence.

620
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:13,641
I vaguely remember.
There was a minor involved.

621
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,974
But the family withdrew the charges.
I think they were paid off.

622
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,431
He's a bastard who hunts kids for
rich men with big wallets.

623
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,058
I think Congressman Mordini
is involved in this mess.

624
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,991
And you're surprised?

625
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,573
I don't know 
how to thank you, Carraro,

626
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:33,734
for the way you're handling 
this delicate case.

627
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:37,236
I've already spoken to the magistrate,
and he suggests...

628
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:41,108
that the address book should disappear.

629
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:46,559
A scandal with the politicians will
only hinder the investigation.

630
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:49,814
I'm convinced you've already
captured the killer.

631
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:53,566
Franz Pagano is a man capable of
blackmailing influential people,

632
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:57,258
until now he's been quiet.
I'd be afraid of...

633
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:01,763
No, don't worry. This Individual isn't
going to blackmail anyone.

634
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,614
If you can prove his guilt...

635
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:08,395
It would be the best result
for your career.

636
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,608
- Also, something else.
- What is it?

637
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:16,889
I want your associate Mordini
dismissed from office.

638
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,158
Mordini is an excellent official.

639
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:25,597
You shouldn't disregard his record
for a slight indiscretion.

640
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:29,321
I appreciate discretions, but you
should have told me about it.

641
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:32,614
My collaborators shouldn't hide
things from me.

642
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:36,719
Secondly, those men were
fucking minors in that villa.

643
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,712
These were little girls.
Even you would...

644
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:43,691
call this beyond an indiscretion.
Isn't that right, Mr. Secretary?

645
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,594
Agreed. 
I'll arrange a transfer out of Rome.

646
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,080
- Is that alright?
- Thank you.

647
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:54,720
I've told you: I don't know!
I didn't get a good look at him.

648
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:58,145
It could be one of these, or
maybe not... I don't know.

649
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:02,959
Take a good look. Did any of
these men come to the lake?

650
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:23,286
I've told you; I don't recognize any
of them. I saw him from a distance.

651
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,532
Are you sure?

652
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,676
I've told you everything I know.

653
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:29,058
Maybe you're the one who did it?

654
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:33,671
You killed her after spying on her
all the time, you filthy maniac!

655
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:38,299
- It's not true! I did nothing.
- You listen good...

656
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,893
If you don't tell me everything you know,
I'll throw you in prison.

657
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,849
Now then, let's start again.
What kind of car was it?

658
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:03,229
A Mercedes. At least it looked like one.
White, with a dark interior.

659
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,642
The man, the killer, are you sure
you can't recognize him?

660
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:11,362
I don't know. If I saw him again,
maybe. Who knows?

661
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,203
Fine, leave. Get out.

662
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:33,675
Doctor, there's a detective who
wants to speak to you.

663
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,508
Quick… help me.

664
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,827
Watch her head!

665
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:49,481
Hurry, hurry!

666
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:05,929
I have nothing to hide.
I've done nothing illegal.

667
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,254
Your surgery, name and...

668
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,891
telephone number were written
throughout the address book.

669
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,868
<i>Do you know how many girls
come have for ND' s'?</i>

670
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:18,992
Why should I refuse them?
It's better than getting pregnant,

671
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,698
and getting an abortion from
a quack with no scruples.

672
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:27,735
Fiorella Icardi came to see you.

673
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:31,798
You know, there's a rule of
professional secrecy...

674
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:36,203
The girl is dead... 
we're talking homicide.

675
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:40,050
She came to find out If she
was pregnant.

676
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,975
That's all. Nothing else.

677
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,480
Who sent her here?
Was it Franz Pagano?

678
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:53,655
I don't have to answer that.
But, I have nothing to hide...

679
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,830
No-one sent her.

680
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,192
I'll come back... 
I'll see you again, Doctor.

681
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:10,069
The bullet was not fired from
the gun you found.

682
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:40,237
I didn't talk, but you'd better
pay up, and quick. I'll be waiting.

683
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:01,744
Ah, it's you. Thanks for coming.
I was a bit worried.

684
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,449
Would you like some whiskey?

685
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:08,896
You know that a detective was here earlier.
But I didn't let myself get cornered.

686
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,850
I said nothing. But he will return.

687
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,122
Perhaps we should have watched him.

688
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,408
But who could have imagined...?

689
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,882
- Franz Hekker has been released.
- I didn't know.

690
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:56,163
The only charge we had on him 
Was prostitution.

691
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:59,334
Because of the blackmail angle,

692
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,220
the magistrate demanded his release.

693
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,942
As soon as he's free, we'll have
another dead body:

694
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,405
the doctor involved 
in his dirty organization.

695
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:08,734
We should have known the shifty
doctor was involved.

696
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,889
I agree with you, 
but he's not the killer.

697
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,167
What game are we playing?
Do you know?

698
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:18,313
I don't think he's the killer,
at least not Fiorella's.

699
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:22,291
I'm sick of your methods!
If you know something, tell me.

700
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:24,408
Or do you think you're the only
one who can do it all?

701
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,279
The tires: the tracks left
at the scene of the crime.

702
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:31,683
The tires were Mlchelins.
Franz's are Goodyears.

703
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:35,002
- But the tracks may not be valid.
- Then there's the report on the gun...

704
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,532
- Let's hear it.
- It came back negative.

705
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:43,342
It doesn't mean it wasn't him.
He could have another.

706
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:47,900
Couldn't he have two guns?
Let's take another path.

707
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:51,737
Maybe Tummoli's been hiding
something as a witness.

708
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,524
I think he knows more than he's saying.

709
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,581
But maybe he's lust selling
us a pack of lies.

710
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,012
Perhaps it's time to take a look
at Congressman Mordini.

711
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:05,053
Don't worry... I'll take care of it.

712
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:19,350
- What time is it?
- Half twelve.

713
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,840
Shit! Another six hours...

714
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:40,367
Who's there?

715
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,190
Who is it?

716
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:09,215
- Everything quiet over night?
- All quiet. He hasn't moved.

717
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,002
Alright.

718
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:29,110
Momolo?

719
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:18,001
- He's been dead at least 5 or 6 hours.
- I won't be able to forget this.

720
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,139
It's all our fault, all of us.

721
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:23,175
This means he was the killer.

722
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:27,495
Don't be so sure. Everyone abused him,
treated him like a clog.

723
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:32,162
We didn't even treat him with respect.
Come on, let's go.

724
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:39,951
Everything seems clear to me.
Through his suicide, Tummoli.... confessed.

725
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:44,010
- Are you really convinced?
- What more do you want?

726
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,991
For me the case is closed.

727
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,028
Don't tell me Fiorella Icardi was
dating that guy.

728
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:53,954
I think she was meeting someone else.

729
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,571
A man in a white Mercedes, 
specifically.

730
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:59,035
Tummoli...? Was the only one 
who mentioned the white Mercedes.

731
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:03,352
Perhaps he invented It.
He added it after we arrested Franz.

732
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,876
- Anything new?
- I've just come from the autopsy.

733
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,097
What's the news?

734
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:13,735
They say the marks from the rope
around his neck discount suicide.

735
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,604
- Well then?
- He was strangled.

736
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,815
We're back to where we started.

737
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,123
Now we've got three murders.

738
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:02,719
What the hell do you want?
I told you not to come.

739
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:07,794
Let me in. I'm scared...
I don't want to go home.

740
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,132
Momolo is dead because he
saw them together.

741
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,396
The gynecologist saw them together
and he's dead too.

742
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,266
What do you care?
You didn't see anything.

743
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,271
- Really, I...
- What?

744
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:17,475
One day...

745
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:20,006
What… did you see something?
Did you tell the police?

746
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,049
I was waiting for you at school.

747
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,805
Be quiet! I know nothing and I
don't want to know anything.

748
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,667
- I know nothing about these people.
- I don't know about them either.

749
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:33,914
But nobody wants to help me.
Franz, hide me. I don't want to go home!

750
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,740
Calm down, you idiot!

751
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:44,443
I've got things to do. You stay here and
don't open the door to anyone. OK?

752
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,320
When I get back, 
I'll see what I can do.

753
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,782
- Ice?
- No, thanks.

754
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,395
How do you expect to incriminate
this degenerate?

755
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:02,655
- Actually, he visited this house.
- He's been here several times.

756
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:08,147
- Taking advantage of my good nature...
- I know about your relationship with Franz.

757
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:13,246
If Franz is known for dealing drugs
then this should be easy.

758
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:17,131
There's no proof. Much
speculation, but no proof.

759
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,794
- See you again, Professor.
- Wait, Chief.

760
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:27,022
- This man... did you at least arrest him?
- We're investigating...

761
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,680
This is wrong. He's still free!

762
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,967
There will only be more
crimes and killings!

763
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,666
Don't take it so hard, Professor.

764
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:45,339
The police are all alike.

765
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,493
They have fun 
making people miserable.

766
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:52,653
Franz?

767
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,937
Help!

768
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,804
What are you looking for?

769
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,992
A button... I dropped a button.

770
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,716
Is this your car?

771
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:44,839
Why? Do you think I can't
have a car like this?

772
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:50,672
You're a bit too sarcastic.
It's not an attractive trait.

773
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:57,094
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

774
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,162
Remember, Gianluca… be good.

775
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:55,668
Excuse me, I didn't want to bother
you in front of the kids...

776
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:57,284
but I need to talk to you urgently.

777
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:01,285
I don't know how. I can't
help you. I must be going.

778
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:04,090
Fiorella was your friend's daughter.

779
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:06,509
I didn't think you'd refuse me.
Just a few questions.

780
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,415
- Hurry, follow me to the office.
- Okay.

781
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:14,998
Cigarette? 
You smoke Benson's, right?

782
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,573
I don't have time to waste.
Get to the point.

783
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:23,367
The person who killed Fiorella 
Frequented the family house.

784
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,249
A friend of the family, 
so to speak.

785
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:28,619
Why couldn't it have been 
a random encounter?

786
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:31,940
No, the relationship 
has lasted for months.

787
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,252
The man who accompanied her 
is around forty...

788
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:38,222
and drives a white Mercedes 
with foreign plates and Michelin tires.

789
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:43,223
You have a Mercedes like that.
Registered under a phony name.

790
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,629
That's why it took so long to find you.

791
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,319
- Why are you telling me these things?
- Look...

792
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:51,794
See, Professor...

793
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:57,782
Here's one of the tracks left by
the car at the scene of the crime.

794
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:02,105
The forensic scientists work at a
high level of efficiency.

795
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:08,447
In nature, nothing is identical.

796
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:12,957
No two eyes the same color, 
no two finger prints are the same.

797
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,817
- I'm not interested In these things.
- One moment. Let me finish...

798
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:20,310
Even tire treads are different.

799
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:24,490
- What are you trying to say?
- I've already told you, Professor.

800
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:27,524
You have a white Mercedes, 
with Michelin tires.

801
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,534
Your insinuations are absurd!

802
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:36,655
Professor... 
you should be more responsive.

803
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:39,308
This ls a murder Investigation;
I'm doing my job.

804
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:45,902
If you co-operate, we can conclude
this nice and quickly.

805
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:47,223
What do you want from me?

806
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:50,767
I want to make prints of your tires.

807
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:55,118
You have now passed all limits!
You're treating me like a criminal.

808
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,010
Who are you calling?

809
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,411
My lawyer; 
he'll put you in your place.

810
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:06,371
Call him. I know you can cause
a lot of trouble.

811
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:12,147
But don't forget the bad publicity.
It'd be better to avoid it all.

812
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,649
You should leave immediately.

813
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:19,559
Professor… you have a firearm,
I imagine?

814
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,551
I expect the gun 
is properly registered?

815
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:28,523
- A 1-65, perhaps?
- You should leave immediately.

816
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:32,303
You see, we never found the murder
weapon in the surrounding area.

817
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:35,193
It was nowhere to be found.

818
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,567
I believe the killer still has it.

819
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:41,541
That Thursday, 
I was operating all day.

820
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,057
Until six, but you still would
have had enough time.

821
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:48,784
Did I kill Fiorella, 
then return to the clinic?

822
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:53,493
- Detective...
- Excuse me for disturbing you, Professor.

823
01:29:58,880 --> 01:29:59,915
Hold it!

824
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,314
Give me the gun.

825
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,063
Cuff him.

826
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:46,057
Now you'll tell me why you killed her.
Come on!

827
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:50,889
It was her fault.

828
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,833
She was a slut.

829
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:59,322
I thought I was alone. I was
waiting to see the Professor.

830
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:04,252
She saw me, 
but acted like she hadn't.

831
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:08,280
She provoked me.

832
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:12,232
Anyone in my place couldn't have
resisted her.

833
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:20,419
But then... then she was pregnant.
She didn't want to have an abortion.

834
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,287
It's simple: leave your wife and kids
and come with me.

835
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:47,888
I killed her for my children.
I killed the others for them, too.

836
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,615
I didn't want their lives mined.

837
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:58,697
Take him away.

838
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:20,488
The bluff with the gun and the
tire tracks worked.

839
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:23,222
Once he had begun, he couldn't stop.

840
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:26,318
He tried to save his family
from his own hypocrisy.

841
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:31,172
Only a maniac could've killed
four people like that.

842
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:36,849
<i>Says</i> who? He'll claim temporary Insanity,
and will end up on some mental ward.

843
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:39,480
Anyway, our investigation ends here.
