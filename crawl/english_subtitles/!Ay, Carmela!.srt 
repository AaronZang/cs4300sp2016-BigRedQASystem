21
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,712
for the fine breeding

22

23
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,036
of my prancer from Jerez.
Sitting

24
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:09,434
in his saddle,
l'm a queen,

25
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:13,193
diamond spurs on my heels,

26
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:16,789
and on my head
for a crown,

27
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:20,435
and on my head
for a crown,

28
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,792
the cheery Cordovan hat.

29
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,357
My prancer

30
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:36,552
gallops and rides the wind
when he crosses the pass

31
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,636
on his way to Jerez.

32
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,318
l love him

33
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,874

35
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,677
with his charms.

36
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,672
My prancer

37
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,037
gallops and rides the wind
when he crosses the pass

38
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,790

l love him

40
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,227
as l love the Gypsy

41
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:14,993
who torments me

42
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,588
with his charms.

43
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:19,392
My prancer

44
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,798
gallops and rides the wind
when he crosses the pass

45
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,910
on his way to Jerez.

46
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,114

50
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:56,395
by that great poet, Machado...

51
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:02,510
Dedicated to General Lister,

52
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:06,072
head of the Ebro army.

53
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,067
Airplanes!

54
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:22,678
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

55
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,993
Everything's okay, friends!

56
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:08,436
lt sounds like one of those
German turkeys.

57
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:12,038
He should go bomb
his fucking mother

58
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:13,873
and leave us alone.

59
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,319
Gustavete will accompany me.

60
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,428
''Your letter,

61
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:41,035
oh noble vigilant heart,

62
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:44,997
strong and indomitable
Spaniard,

63
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,434
your letter,

64
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,478
heroic Lister,
helps me bear

65
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,553
the burden of death.

66
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:56,989
Your letter brings to me

67
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,269
the din of war
on Spanish soil.

68
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,394
Gunpowder and rosemary

69
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:04,351
have stirred my heart.

70
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,751
There, where the Ebro
starts her journey,

71
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,590
on that cold peak
where the Spanish cry is born,

72
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,991
from mountain to sea,
l say to you:

73
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:20,036
if my pen had the worth
of your captain's pistol,

74
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,634
contented l would die.''

75
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,272
The farts!

76
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,396
Come on, let's hear
the farts!

77
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,831
Fine, l'll sound retreat
and then l'm off.

78
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:00,594
Remember?

79
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,747
l hope it comes out.

80
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,515
Long live the Republic!

81
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:55,552
NO GOlNG BACK!
FORWARD!

82
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:02,037
Long live the Republic!

83
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,714
lf the priests knew
of the licking that they're due,

84
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,193
they'd shout...

85
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,277
liberty, liberty, liberty!

86
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:18,117
Long live the Riego anthem!

87
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:21,831
Long live the Republic!

88
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,228
lf the king only knew,
then he would

89
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:28,554
shout, too...

90
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:30,637
liberty, liberty, liberty.

91
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,388
Liberty! Liberty! Liberty!

92
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:06,428
l want no objections,
all right?

93
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:13,198
-You see that?
-He's starving.

94
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,275
And l'm not?

95
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:24,551
Goddamn bloody fucking war...

96
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,108
There's eleven.

THAT'S CHEATlNG!

100
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:02,229
Come on. You really
enjoy tormenting him.

101
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,908
ls it my fault
he can't divide?

102
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:12,833
-Know what l was thinking about?
-No.

103
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,712
The meals in the seminary.
What blow-outs!

104
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:18,432
You know priests.

105
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,749
First, rice with oil and garlic.

106
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,392
Then, fish with sauce.

107
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:25,947
On special days,

108
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,952
there were shell fish
in the rice.

109
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,671
But real shell fish,
and lots, too.

110
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:36,232
Shrimp, prawns, mussels...

111
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:40,469
Gustavete...

112
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,953
You like shell fish?

113
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,948
CRABS

114
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,870
Crabs, he says. Fuck me.

115
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,348
Come on, move!
Everyone outside!

116
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:31,714
Outside!

117
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,109
We need the beds
forthe wounded.

118
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:38,071
-Move your ass!
-Come on!

119
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,394
Move, damnit!

120
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:42,838
Get out of there.

121
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,115
-Move it.
-What's going on?

122
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:47,150
-Just get up.
-Why?

123
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,394
Get up now!

124
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:49,588
Some tour.

125
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:52,633
-You can't eat or sleep...
-Now what?

126
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,990
And that kid twitching
around in the bed, damnit.

127
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:59,072
-Leave him alone.
-Let's go to the lorry.

128
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:15,798
lt's all your fault.

129
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:19,077
Signing a contract
to work at the front!

130
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,394
What contract?

131
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,352
lt was either that
or fighting here.

132
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:25,438
l'd be six feet under.

133
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,473
Well, we've come and raised
the troops' morale, right?

134
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,828
-Here.
-l say...

135
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:33,030
We can go back to Valencia.

136
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:36,993
Because here we'll be bombed
or starved or frozen.

137
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:40,035
Come on, let's go
to Valencia.

138
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,718
Where do we get gas?

139
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,387
Who's there?

140
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:07,154
Who's there?

141
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,269
Wait for me, l'll go.

142
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:27,149
Christ!

143
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,714
Good evening.

144
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:30,794
Evening.

145
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:33,754
Have you my friends
around here?

146
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:37,668
One is tall with a big nose,
the other's a bit shorter.

147
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,628
No, l haven't.

148
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,588
Want to get in?

149
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:50,478
Get in, it's cold.

150
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:53,149
But if l don't see them...

151
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,192
You see better from here.

152
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,028
You've got a point.

153
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:01,115
Hey, do you like anis?

154
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,429
Well...

155
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,113
Make up your mind.

156
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,915
Get in, it's damp out here.

157
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:08,950
-Just for a minute.
-Come on.

158
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,914
-lt's cold tonight.
-lt is.

159
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,069
Try this.

160
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:20,273
lt'll warm you up.

161
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:23,149
Thanks.

162
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,228
Why were you out?

163
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:32,834
To find them.

164
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,151
We did the show tonight.

165
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,153
You're a dancer.

166
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,914
What a guy!
How did you guess that?

167
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,875
They're as hard as iron!

168
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,877
-Fresh!
-lt's to keep warm.

169
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:49,394
Come on...

170
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:53,110
-Let me warm my hands on yourtits.
-Hands off!

171
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,275
Hey...

172
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:00,278
-Where are you from?
-Murcia.

173
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:04,189
-Just a bit.
-l said no, damnit!

174
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,468
Fuck it anyway!

175
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:08,435
You get in,
drink the anis,

176
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:10,272
then nothing!

177
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:13,954
All right!

178
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,348
Get out!

179
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,918
Okay, take it easy.

180
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,468
Here.

181
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:21,828
Come here.

182
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:26,594
Happy now?

183
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:30,273
The other one, too.

184
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:34,792
You men are all the same.

185
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:36,318
You're so pretty.

186
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,871
You're prettier
than the Fuensanta.

187
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,109
Give me a kiss.
Just a kiss.

188
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:44,712
No, wait, wait...

189
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:47,194
-We'll lie down.
-They're here.

190
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,673
-Who?
-My friends.

191
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,109
Here, a kiss,
so you can't say...

192
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:53,116
So long, Murcian!
Thanks.

193
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,958
Valencia...

194
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:11,074
is the land of flowers,
of light and of love!

195
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,758
Valencia...

196
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,589
your women all have
the color of roses...

197
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,590
What's happening?
Stop!

198
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:14,390
-Stop, for God's sake! Stop!
-What? All right.

199
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,030
God, we were about to crash!

200
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:20,596
lf you're sleepy, say so.
Why didn't you?

201
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,835
-l'm not sleepy.
-God, this man!

202
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:26,116
lf l didn't love you...

203
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:35,869
-lt was nothing. l could see.
-With your eyes closed?

204
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:38,354
We're going to sleep.

205
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:40,556
-Gustavete!
-Open up.

206
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:42,358
They're sounding reveille.

207
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:44,836
-Look at him!
-Come on, kid.

208
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:47,115
You've had enough sleep.

209
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,157
-lt's yourturn to drive.
-He can't drive.

210
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:50,950
Come on.

211
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:53,753
l drive better asleep
than he does awake.

212
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:55,713
Help me up.

213
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:16,588
One thing...

214
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:18,034
What?

215
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,314
You...

216
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:22,788
with the soldier,

217
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,718
in the lorry...

218
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,438
how far did you go?

219
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:31,798
You can be so silly.
Getting jealous...

220
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,869
He'll fuck the differential!

221
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:44,917
Carmela...

222
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,352
Now that l'm awake,

223
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,838
shall we do a Uruguay?

224
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,191
No, l'm tired. Why not
in Valencia tomorrow?

225
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:25,392
Chaparrita, the divine,

226
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:28,958
early in the morning

227
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:32,276
goes to pray
in the holy temple.

228
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,677
She asks

229
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:38,750
and begs of God

230
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:42,872
to take herto His bosom
when hertime to rest is due.

231
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,998
She showers me with kisses

232
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:50,953
and nibbles me with love
and sometimes

233
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:52,956
makes me cry.

234
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:55,830
Ssometimes when she cries,

235
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,350
she pales and fades,

236
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:02,869
but soon paints herself
again.

237
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:04,114
Why are you here?

238
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,308
Are you mute?

239
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:14,274
Where are you going?

240
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:15,630
Don't move!

241
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:34,108
To Valencia?

242
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:37,067
Where did you come from?

243
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,348
From Montejo?

244
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:46,349
On the ground!

245
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,267
Come on, quick!

246
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:50,798
Your papers!

247
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:54,074
To the lorry.

248
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:57,037
Let's get your papers.

249
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,551
Move, fucker!

250
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,950
-What's going on?
-Overthere!

251
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:04,308
Come on, move it!

252
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:06,348
Hello, comrade.

253
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,835
Actors entertaining
the heroic Republican army.

254
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:11,558
Search the lorry.

255
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:18,830
Salute like real Spaniards.

256
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:21,311
l think we've blown it.

257
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:22,628
Hail Franco!

258
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:24,234
Up with Spain!

259
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:25,914
Captain...

260
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:31,268
Valencia, eh?

261
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,069
And this?

262
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,949
The flag isn't ours,
l swear.

263
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,672
lt was for a number.

264
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:55,949
Christ knows
it wasn't funny...

265
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,990
Leave Christ out of it!

266
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:00,669
Yes, sir.

267
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:02,274
He's... out of it.

268
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,515
lt belonged to the Republicans...

269
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:07,313
the reds, excuse me.
The flag, l mean.

270
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:11,713
We're artists. We've never
mixed politics with our act.

271
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,910
Tell him you were a seminarist.

272
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,633
Yes, l came close
to saying Mass.

273
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:17,828
Why didn't you?

274
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,348
Well, the farts...

275
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:20,514
What was that?

276
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:22,789
Excuse me, the starts.

277
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:25,672
l'm a bit nervous
and at times...

278
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:34,030
This is not
the red zone.

279
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:38,197
-Anything else, sir?
-No.

280
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:39,388
Yes, sir.

281
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,518
lt's not the red zone.

282
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:50,190
We're not bloodthirsty
like the communists.

283
00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:54,154
There's justice
in Franco's Spain.

284
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,509
Good Spaniards
have nothing to fear.

285
00:24:59,639 --> 00:25:01,277
So, we can leave then?

286
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,153
Hail Franco!

287
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:09,507
UP WlTH SPAlN

288
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:11,997
You learn quickly.

289
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,589
He can hear,
but not speak?

290
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:18,155
Who, him?
No, sir, not a word.

291
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:19,750
How's that?

292
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:22,918
We don't know.
We found him on the road,

293
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,713
starving.
No papers, nothing.

294
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,957
And, if you'll pardon me,
stark naked.

295
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:32,037
We fed and clothed him
and he stayed.

296
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,390
He remembers nothing.

297
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,750
He must be mute from fear.

298
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:38,638
From bombing...

299
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,190
By those bloody reds.

300
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:44,314
Well, then.

301
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:46,477
Thank you very much.

302
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:50,509
Enough bothering the lieutenant.
Enjoy your meal.

303
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:57,991
Where are you going?

304
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,678
To get the lorry.

305
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,109
Right.

306
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:06,869
And then to Valencia.

307
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:08,308
-Yes...
-No!

308
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,030
Who, us? We're not leaving
Nationalist Spain.

309
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,354
This is home.

310
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,637
You can be sure of that.

311
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,194
Cardoso!

312
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,234
Cardoso!

313
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:28,034
Yes, sir!

314
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:32,713
Take this crew over
to the school.

315
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:35,149
Why the school?

316
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:38,754
So you can
learn some more.

317
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,790
What are they doing?

318
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,832
Paulino, l can't bear it!
Ourthings!

319
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,593
-Will we get them back?
-Of course.

320
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,268
Hurry up.

321
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:03,749
Good afternoon.

322
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:05,348
'Afternoon.

323
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:15,193
Excuse me...
This is a jail, isn't it?

324
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,797
What do you think?

325
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,437
We haven't done anything.

326
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,034
You're not from here.

327
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:27,835
No, we're just
passing through.

328
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:33,829
And that lot?

329
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:38,077
Prisoners of war.

330
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:39,957
lnternational Brigades.

331
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:42,474
Foreigners,
from different countries.

332
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:47,394
What about you?

333
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,153
You been here long?

334
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,511
Since they took the town.

335
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,993
God knows
where my sons are.

336
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,838
Don't worry, ma'am.

337
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:01,232
We who are innocent

338
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,147

339
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,188
Friends?

340
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:28,191
Ah, Poland!

341
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,628
Right.

342
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,472
You, Polish.

343
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,313
Poland very far,
very far from here.

344
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:43,629
A bullet?

345
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,390
Poorthing.
Does it hurt?

346
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:02,234
You understand him?

347
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:05,511
Of course. He says
he's from here, Poland.

348
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,157
You, Polish...

349
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:10,874
Me, Spanish.
From here...

350
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:13,356
From Spain. You say it.

351
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:14,754
Spain.

352
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,549
Very good!
You see

353
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:31,874
how fast he is?

354
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:33,478
Yes, he's very clever.

355
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:35,554
Me,

356
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:36,989
Carmela.

357
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,428
More softly.

358
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:41,628
More sweetly.

359
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,308
Car-me-la.

360
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:46,995
That's it.

361
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:51,875
Ay, Carmela!
Ay, Carmela!

362
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,393
Stand up everyone!

363
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:10,155
Come on!

Everybody get up!

You...

And you...

And you...

You, too...

And you...

370
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:51,668
Well, look here!

373
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,310
to get a look at you.

374
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,713
l'm not a communist.

375
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,514
You don't say?

376
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:07,433
Come on, shitbag.
Get moving.

377
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:11,312
You won't fuck with me anymore,
bastard.

378
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:17,833

-No, it's not!

381
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:41,192
They're going to kill us.
Kill us!

382
00:33:57,439 --> 00:33:59,794
-Tie them up.
-Come on, let's go.

383
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:01,068
Put them there.

384
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:03,234
Lights!

385
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:05,474
Ready!

Fire!

387
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,194
Let's see.

388
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:21,471
The artists, come out.

389
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:24,468
That's us.

390
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:27,077
Or shall we beat you out?

lt's us.

Let's go.

395

Listen, this is a mistake.
We're not reds.

396
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,113
We're good Spaniards.

397
00:34:49,799 --> 00:34:51,517
Take me to the lieutenant.

398
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,517
What's that idiot saying?

399
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,154
ltalians.

400
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:12,348
ltalians and Spanish, friends.

401
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:14,074
Very friends...

402

Mussolini, great man.

403
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:20,187
lt's no good, Paulino.
lt's over.

l want to see a priest.

405
00:35:25,319 --> 00:35:27,310
The lady wants to confess.

406
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:28,156
ME, TOO.

407
00:35:29,279 --> 00:35:31,349
You understand?
Con-fess.

408
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,399
No, l want us to get married.

409
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,232
-We are married!
-Just a civil marriage.

410
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:40,590
l want a church wedding.

411
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:44,717
Please, before
these bastards kill us.

412
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,194
Listen, where...

413
00:35:56,399 --> 00:35:57,309

414
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:00,155
Sorry, l don't speak Spanish.

415
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:06,638
TO TRlAL

416
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:09,673
Yes, we're going
to be court-martialled.

417
00:36:09,879 --> 00:36:10,948
ls that bad?

418
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,238
What, a court martial?

419
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:15,754
lt's the worst.

420
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,112
GO YA THEATRE

421
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:19,793
Come on...

422
00:38:01,799 --> 00:38:04,438
-Lieutenant, the prisoners.
-Here.

423
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,148
You and you.

424
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,034
Well, then.

425
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:42,237
''Taken prisoner
when trying to infiltrate

426

behind our lines,

427
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,549
hoping to provoke disorder
in our rearguard.''

428
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:49,954
We're not infiltrators.

429
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:51,592
lt's a mistake. We...

430
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:52,834
Silence!

431
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,592
''They possessed

Also a note from a political

Commissar...

435
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:12,274
illegible...

436
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:14,197
and a Republican flag.''

437
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:18,676
You said this was part
of your act, right?

438
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,154
Right, right.

439
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:22,632
Now come on.

440
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:25,512
Show me what you did
with that damn flag.

441
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:28,868
Yes, sir.

442
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,394
Here...

443

Carmela...

444
00:39:34,479 --> 00:39:36,197
-My wife...
-At your service.

445
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:39,272
-l had the flag...
-l'll explain.

446
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,153
lf she may...

447
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:44,718
she'll remove her coat.

448
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:46,315
Of course.

449
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:00,553
She draped the flag...

450
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:02,796
like it was a tunic.

451
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:04,637
-With one breast bare.
-What?

452
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:07,114
So he'll think it was a joke.

453
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:12,471
With one breast showing.

454
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:16,115
To give the lads a hard-on,
if you get my drift.

455
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:18,152
My compliments. Beautiful.

456
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:21,074
For God's sake.

457
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:24,988
Then...

458
00:40:25,919 --> 00:40:26,988
Gustavete...

459
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,873
on all fours...

460
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:30,268
was the lion.

461
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,675
Do the lion
forthe lieutenant.

462
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:43,428
lt was absurd,

463
00:40:43,919 --> 00:40:44,988
crap,

464
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,511
the Commissar's idea.

465
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:48,828
But l...

466
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:52,155
l'm a tenor, a lyric tenor.

467
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:54,271
-A singer?
-A singer.

468
00:40:54,879 --> 00:40:56,232
Please, carry on.

469
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:18,438
Wonderful. My compliments.

470
00:41:18,999 --> 00:41:20,398
Do you like poetry?

471
00:41:20,759 --> 00:41:21,589
Yes.

472
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:27,954
''He was seen walking
amongst rifles

473

down a street to the fields,

00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:35,268
the morning stars
still in the sky.

475

They killed Frederico
as the moon hid.

476

The firing squad

477

dared not look up...''

478
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:43,275
Wrong side!

479
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:44,674
A poet, too.

480
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:46,198
Very interesting.

481
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:54,395
Can't you stop it flashing?

482
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,989
You control the light
be moving the lamp, sir.

483
00:41:58,519 --> 00:41:59,474
Very good.

484

lf you give me

that your hands
are unbloodied,

490
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:22,311
l may get you freed.

491
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:25,710
-Look!
-Like the driven snow!

492
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:27,588

493
00:42:28,399 --> 00:42:30,754
Since l am a theater director,

to organize a concert
for our soldiers.

496
00:42:36,879 --> 00:42:38,835
May l count on
your collaboration?

497
00:42:40,879 --> 00:42:41,868
Lieutenant...

And with an eminent son

Thank you.

503
00:42:54,999 --> 00:42:58,628
You've got Michelangelo,
Dante, Petrarch,

504
00:42:58,879 --> 00:43:00,710
Puccini, Anchovy, Mussolini...

505

Yes, lieutenant,

-Well, that.
-Thank you.

Very good.

508
00:43:09,479 --> 00:43:11,754
But what about costumes
and music?

509
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:15,315
Tell him the bastards
stole our lorry...

510
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:16,716
What?

511
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,908
What Miss Carmela
means is that

512
00:43:20,399 --> 00:43:23,516
we are sadly lacking
in wardrobe

513
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,955
and she is
greatly distressed

514
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:28,753
at having to perform
in such conditions.

515
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:32,628
Comrades, in the new Spain,
as in Fascist ltaly...

516
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:33,874
no excuses.

517
00:43:34,439 --> 00:43:36,236
Believe, obey, fight!

518
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,074
Believe, obey, fight!

519
00:43:42,799 --> 00:43:43,993
LONG LlVE MULOSlNl

520
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:45,433
Long live the Duce!

521
00:43:58,679 --> 00:43:59,907
What a place!

522
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,231
ls it good?

523
00:44:49,799 --> 00:44:51,790
Exquisite! Fit for a king!

524
00:44:51,999 --> 00:44:53,591
Don't exaggerate.

525
00:44:53,799 --> 00:44:56,233
Because when mamma makes it...

526
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:00,194
What's that?

527
00:45:00,399 --> 00:45:01,673
He says his mother

528
00:45:01,879 --> 00:45:04,109
makes even better spaghetti.

529
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,277
Our mammas are wonderful.

530
00:45:08,759 --> 00:45:11,796
You nevertold me
you spoke ltalian.

531
00:45:11,999 --> 00:45:13,114
The seminary again.

532
00:45:13,439 --> 00:45:15,589
Spanish and ltalian
are from ltaly,

533
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:18,108
the Romans.
And l speak Latin.

534
00:45:24,799 --> 00:45:27,438
Sorry, l don't understand
Spanish.

535
00:45:28,879 --> 00:45:30,073
lgnoramus.

536
00:45:30,959 --> 00:45:33,473
''Wine that maketh glad
the heart of men!''

537
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,228
He liked that.

538
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:51,953
Once you get a good meal
inside you...

539
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:00,633
There's one thing.

540
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,828
lf the fascists always eat
like this, we've lost the war.

541
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:15,309
Here.

542
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:20,596
May l?

543
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:22,672
Come in, come in.

544
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:34,149
lt's you. Great.

545
00:46:34,399 --> 00:46:37,789
Look, l think you'll
find some costumes here.

546
00:46:37,999 --> 00:46:39,990
What's here is yours.

547
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:44,994
All that's here is yours.

548
00:46:45,479 --> 00:46:47,390
Go on.

549
00:46:48,279 --> 00:46:49,394
Come on, Gustavete.

550
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:53,117
Meanwhile, we'll talk
about the show.

551
00:46:53,919 --> 00:46:55,352
Now, my dear Paulino,

552
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:58,027
the scripts
forthe new scenes.

553
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,116
This is an introduction.

554
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:04,075
And this is a beautiful
and patriotic poem.

555
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:07,427
l want help
with the flag number.

556
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:09,311
-There's a flag number?
-Yes.

557
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:13,274
But it's nothing
like the reds' number.

558
00:47:13,479 --> 00:47:16,551
This is the idea.
You have to fill it out,

559
00:47:16,759 --> 00:47:17,874
develop it.

560
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,556
l'll expect you shortly
in the theater.

561
00:47:24,279 --> 00:47:27,828
-Believe, obey, and fight!
-Very good.

562
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:30,917
Give me a good scene
with the flag.

563
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,632
Don't worry, lieutenant.

564
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:38,596
''On the Hill of the Angels,

565
00:47:38,799 --> 00:47:41,188
which the angels guard,

566
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:45,188
they have shot Jesus,
and the stones are bleeding...''

567
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:46,832
-You see this?
-What?

568
00:47:53,319 --> 00:47:54,229
Listen.

569
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:57,273
We could ask the lieutenant
and have

570
00:47:57,559 --> 00:47:58,833
a church wedding.

571
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:00,958
lf we get out of this.

572
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:05,390
-You swear?
-Yes, damnit!

573
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:07,194
Give me a kiss!

574
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,230
-The soldier.
-Come on.

575
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:20,789
To work.
l have to learn this.

576
00:48:23,439 --> 00:48:25,794
-What about me?
-Let's see.

577
00:48:26,439 --> 00:48:29,590
Look. New words
for ''My Prancer''.

578
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:32,554
What's that?

579
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:39,354
''But be not afraid, mother.

580
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:42,198
All Castile is up in arms.

581
00:48:42,439 --> 00:48:44,999
Madrid is already in view.

582
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:48,311
Can't you hear? Franco is here.
Up with Sain!''

583
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:49,588
lt needs polka dots.

584
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:51,949
Give me one of those.

585
00:48:55,479 --> 00:48:57,595
-''Macedonia Gold''.
-Not ''Mathedonia''.

586
00:48:57,799 --> 00:48:59,915
-''Macedonia''.
-''Macedonia''.

587
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:02,988
l never smoke these,
but for once...

588
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:04,473
Since it's a war.

589
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:07,834
This is all there is.
Well?

590
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:09,028
Whatever you want.

591
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,877
-This is no use for a flounce.
-l don't know.

592
00:49:20,399 --> 00:49:21,878
Let's look upstairs.

593
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:28,389
-Long live Spain!
-Long live!

594
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:33,875
''Unconquered saviours
of the fatherland:

595
00:49:34,479 --> 00:49:37,073
today you, the brain,

596
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:40,908
the heart and the arm
of the glorious uprising

597
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,032
which has returned to Spain her
pride in her imperial destiny...''

598
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:49,678
Man, this is something!

599
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:52,078
Damn them anyway.

600
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:57,117
You like this material?

601
00:49:58,919 --> 00:50:00,989
lt's for covering mattresses.

602
00:50:02,359 --> 00:50:03,633
Tight, so it stays up.

603
00:50:21,919 --> 00:50:22,829
What's up?

604
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:24,434
Take Big-Eyes away.

605
00:50:33,479 --> 00:50:34,309
That's it.

606
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:38,394
Hey, kid!

607
00:50:38,759 --> 00:50:39,874
You! Kid!

608
00:50:40,439 --> 00:50:42,236
Let's get a drink.

609
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:43,474
What?

610
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:45,476
-A drink, see?
-Where?

611
00:50:47,479 --> 00:50:48,992
No fine sewing,

612
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:50,757
no hems, nothing.

613
00:50:50,999 --> 00:50:53,388
The ruffles and that's it.
Come on.

614
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,272
We don't have time
for anything fancy.

615
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,269
The scissors are behind you.

616
00:51:01,879 --> 00:51:03,437
What did l tell you?

617
00:51:04,399 --> 00:51:05,388
Here, try it.

618
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:08,669
No, not like that.

619
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:10,034
Look, look.

620
00:51:17,759 --> 00:51:18,874
Goddamn bloody...

621
00:51:19,439 --> 00:51:20,428
Vinegar!

622
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:24,355
How long has it been here?

623
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:25,958
-It's not good?
-No.

624
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:40,597
These people didn't

625
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:43,757
even get to dessert.

626
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:51,668
Terrific.

627
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:53,434
Quinine wine,

628
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:55,630
good even for invalids.

629
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,232
Great forthe digestion.

630
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:02,831
A Neapolitan song.

631
00:52:17,879 --> 00:52:18,595
You like it?

632
00:52:19,959 --> 00:52:21,074
Marsala's better.

633
00:52:21,479 --> 00:52:23,197
Fuck, you're never happy.

634
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:25,838
Give me a Macedonia.

635
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:28,194
-Macedonia.
-Macedonia.

636
00:52:28,399 --> 00:52:31,311
Macedonia! When will you
learn ltalian?

637
00:53:38,399 --> 00:53:40,310
-Carmela!
-What?

638
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:41,429
Carmelilla!

639
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:43,751
-What do you want?
-Come.

640
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,588
Come here.

641
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:52,548
Carry on.

642
00:54:05,879 --> 00:54:06,948
Look at that bed.

643
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:08,834
Are you crazy?

644
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:10,594
And the soldier?

645
00:54:10,799 --> 00:54:13,711
To Uruguay, guay...

646
00:54:13,919 --> 00:54:16,274
l won't go, go...

647
00:54:16,799 --> 00:54:19,916
Because l can't swim.

648
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:26,079
Come here, my queen,
l'm brimming over.

649
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:27,947
Devil of a man...

650
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:31,118
And in such a hurry.

651
00:54:34,279 --> 00:54:36,156
-You'll never change.
-No.

652
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:39,629
ldiot!

653
00:54:41,759 --> 00:54:44,068
-l want to, too, believe me.
-Yes?

654
00:54:44,839 --> 00:54:46,795
Just the way l like it,

655
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:49,396
your ass is cold and yourtits

656
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,588
are hot...

657
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:51,988
Paulino...

658
00:54:52,399 --> 00:54:54,788
-What is it, my dove?
-Look.

659
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:01,308
lt's the mayor!

660
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:09,194
What are you doing?

661
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,867
You have to ask?

662
00:55:11,279 --> 00:55:13,839
-Take it easy. Come here.
-No, no...

663
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:15,313
Carmela, my life...

664
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:18,758
-Our love conquers all.
-You want us to...

665
00:55:18,959 --> 00:55:19,869
with them...

666
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,148
watching?

667
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,715
l understand you, of course.

668
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:27,317
l know you're sensitive.

669
00:55:27,759 --> 00:55:30,512
But if we don't overcome
these things...

670
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:34,669
-lt'll be the end of us.
-But Paulino!

671
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:37,518
And just work it out.

672
00:55:37,719 --> 00:55:39,391
How long has it been

673
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:41,789
since we've had a bed
to ourselves?

674
00:55:41,999 --> 00:55:43,034
That's true.

675
00:55:43,399 --> 00:55:45,913
-But this is the mayor's bed!
-Right.

676
00:55:47,999 --> 00:55:49,034
Hush!

677
00:55:50,279 --> 00:55:51,314
Take it easy.

678
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,998
Leave it to me.

679
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:00,877
We're alone in the world.

680
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,757
l love you so much...

681
00:56:39,305 --> 00:56:40,374
You know what?

682
00:56:40,585 --> 00:56:43,099
This new flag number
is vulgar.

683
00:56:43,425 --> 00:56:46,064
You should be ashamed of it.

684
00:56:46,265 --> 00:56:49,063
-lt's the lieutenant's.
-He should be ashamed.

685
00:56:49,945 --> 00:56:52,982
-And l'll tell him that.
-lt's our necks.

686
00:56:53,185 --> 00:56:54,538
-You're a chicken.
-What?

687
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,303
Me? l'll thump you!

688
00:56:57,145 --> 00:57:00,262
You're an angel on stage
and a devil in bed.

689
00:57:00,465 --> 00:57:02,421
And a chicken otherwise.

690
00:57:02,625 --> 00:57:04,183
You should have said

691
00:57:04,385 --> 00:57:07,377
we wouldn't work
without our lorry.

692
00:57:08,745 --> 00:57:09,700
Keep moving.

693
00:57:10,465 --> 00:57:12,262
l'll look ridiculous.

694
00:57:14,545 --> 00:57:15,773
And it's my period.

695
00:57:16,265 --> 00:57:18,574
lt's not your imagination?

696
00:57:18,785 --> 00:57:20,059
My imagination?

697
00:57:20,265 --> 00:57:22,620
No, my wisdom tooth
tells me when.

698
00:57:22,825 --> 00:57:23,814
Great!

699
00:57:24,345 --> 00:57:26,222
Where will l get napkins?

700
00:57:26,585 --> 00:57:28,701
Maybe the lieutenant
can lend me some.

701
00:57:30,425 --> 00:57:32,381
-Come on there!
-Move!

702
00:57:36,345 --> 00:57:38,859
-At last! All ready?
-Lieutenant.

703
00:57:39,065 --> 00:57:42,944
The costumes are ready
and the new numbers are here.

704
00:57:43,145 --> 00:57:45,534
-And the flag number?
-Right here.

705
00:57:45,985 --> 00:57:48,453
''Varietès'' sounds more elegant.

706
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:50,337
You ask why we changed it?

707
00:57:50,545 --> 00:57:52,854
''Varietès'' is French.

708
00:57:53,065 --> 00:57:55,738
ln the new Spain,
we speak lmperial Spanish.

709
00:57:56,305 --> 00:57:57,784
-Please.
-Let's go.

710
00:57:58,665 --> 00:58:01,304
SHOW TONlGHT
FOR THE NATlONALlST ARMY

711
00:58:01,505 --> 00:58:03,655
C ARMELA AND PAULlNO
TlP-YOP VARlETY

712
00:58:04,305 --> 00:58:05,579
Lieutenant,

713
00:58:05,985 --> 00:58:08,863
let's talk about
the damn flag number.

714
00:58:09,065 --> 00:58:11,056
Excuse her, she's nervous.

715
00:58:11,265 --> 00:58:12,414
Leave me alone!

716
00:58:12,945 --> 00:58:14,139
Please continue.

717
00:58:14,385 --> 00:58:16,421
l don't say it's not witty,

718
00:58:16,745 --> 00:58:19,976
but l do think
it's coarse and vulgar.

719
00:58:20,745 --> 00:58:21,939
What's that in ltalian.

720
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:24,215
Yes. A real shit.

721
00:58:24,665 --> 00:58:27,543
Your wife is clever.
That was my idea.

722
00:58:28,305 --> 00:58:30,819
To do something
tasteless,

723
00:58:31,145 --> 00:58:32,464
coarse, crude...

724
00:58:32,825 --> 00:58:33,735
And why?

725
00:58:33,945 --> 00:58:36,664
Because that number
is dedicated

726
00:58:36,865 --> 00:58:40,744
to the Brigade prisioners
who have no culture.

727
00:58:41,305 --> 00:58:42,658
Northern barbarians

728
00:58:42,865 --> 00:58:45,459
who don't understand
beauty and delicacy.

729
00:58:45,945 --> 00:58:47,264
Please, madam.

730
00:58:48,065 --> 00:58:50,374
Tell me what he said.

731
00:58:52,385 --> 00:58:54,421
Delicious.
You don't want any?

732
00:58:56,865 --> 00:58:59,538
Don't you like rabbit?

733
00:59:00,865 --> 00:59:03,299
lT'S C AT

734
00:59:03,505 --> 00:59:04,620
You're kidding.

735
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:14,177
lt tastes like rabbit.

736
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:23,860
lt is rabbit.

737
00:59:24,265 --> 00:59:25,539
Wild rabbit, too.

738
00:59:25,825 --> 00:59:27,975
lt tastes of thyme
and rosemary.

739
00:59:28,185 --> 00:59:29,379
''Open up doctor.

740
00:59:29,745 --> 00:59:32,782
l know you're in,
l recognize your voice

741
00:59:32,985 --> 00:59:34,384
from the radio.''

742
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:36,340
What's that?

743
00:59:36,745 --> 00:59:39,464
-Some rabbit.
-Where did you get it?

744
00:59:40,665 --> 00:59:41,984
l have my contacts.

745
00:59:43,265 --> 00:59:45,142
-lt's good.
-You'll be sick.

746
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:51,536
After all we've eaten...

747
00:59:52,785 --> 00:59:54,343
You must make provision.

748
00:59:54,705 --> 00:59:57,173
''Afterthe feast
comes the famine.''

749
00:59:58,225 --> 01:00:00,693
''l recognize your voice
from the radio.

750
01:00:00,905 --> 01:00:02,304
l heard it...''

751
01:00:02,905 --> 01:00:03,974
lt's so stupid!

752
01:00:05,465 --> 01:00:06,614
Goddamn!

753
01:00:12,705 --> 01:00:15,617
So it's cat?
Rabbit, and full of shot!

754
01:00:17,465 --> 01:00:19,820
Now l've fucked up a tooth.

755
01:00:20,385 --> 01:00:22,660
''...feverish, very feverish.

756
01:00:23,105 --> 01:00:24,424
Put in a thermometer...''

757
01:00:25,265 --> 01:00:26,300
You want it?

758
01:00:27,465 --> 01:00:28,659
Here, take it.

759
01:00:29,185 --> 01:00:31,415
ln exchange,
look for some wine.

760
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:33,502
A meal without wine is...

761
01:00:33,705 --> 01:00:35,058
''No matter.

762
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:36,454
Put it into me,

763
01:00:37,505 --> 01:00:39,700
and see how
l'll make it work.''

764
01:00:41,185 --> 01:00:42,459
lt's disgusting!

765
01:00:42,865 --> 01:00:45,254
Without my things,
wearing a curtain,

766
01:00:45,465 --> 01:00:48,184
no rehearsals,
my period's due,

767
01:00:48,425 --> 01:00:50,302
and this script is shit.

768
01:00:52,385 --> 01:00:53,659
Tell me,

769
01:00:54,225 --> 01:00:55,453
when does it start?

770
01:00:56,825 --> 01:00:57,894
l haven't a clue.

771
01:00:58,585 --> 01:01:00,894
That lieutenant's a real liar.

772
01:01:01,705 --> 01:01:03,741
Famous theater director...

773
01:01:04,425 --> 01:01:05,904
A stagehand, l'm sure!

774
01:01:07,105 --> 01:01:08,060
Paulino...

775
01:01:10,025 --> 01:01:12,459
lf they do bring
the Poles in,

776
01:01:13,625 --> 01:01:14,580
this...

777
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:17,099
this is a bitch.

778
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:20,574
What do you say?

779
01:01:21,025 --> 01:01:22,458
What can l say?

780
01:01:24,345 --> 01:01:25,858
How can they bring them

781
01:01:26,105 --> 01:01:27,936
if they're to be shot
tomorrow?

782
01:01:29,225 --> 01:01:31,580
Maybe it's like
a favor forthem.

783
01:01:31,865 --> 01:01:33,457
lt's no favor for me

784
01:01:33,705 --> 01:01:36,424
to have to perform forthem

785
01:01:36,905 --> 01:01:38,258
knowing they'll be shot.

786
01:01:38,905 --> 01:01:40,543
Don't take it like that.

787
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:42,816
lt might help distract them.

788
01:01:43,065 --> 01:01:44,100
Sure.

789
01:01:44,465 --> 01:01:46,854
Condemned to death,
they'll want a party.

790
01:01:47,185 --> 01:01:49,141
Can you seen my bra?

791
01:01:54,785 --> 01:01:55,581
No.

792
01:01:58,425 --> 01:01:59,540
lt's such a pity.

793
01:02:01,665 --> 01:02:03,815
To come so far, forthis.

794
01:02:04,105 --> 01:02:05,697
We might be a success.

795
01:02:07,425 --> 01:02:08,938
l mean the Poles.

796
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:17,183
lmagine his mother.

797
01:02:17,825 --> 01:02:18,974
Whose mother?

798
01:02:20,385 --> 01:02:21,613
The Pole's mother.

799
01:02:24,465 --> 01:02:25,534
And obviously,

800
01:02:26,425 --> 01:02:27,938
being a communist,

801
01:02:29,305 --> 01:02:30,943
she can't even pray.

802
01:02:32,385 --> 01:02:35,297
Poland's far away.
She may not even know.

803
01:02:35,505 --> 01:02:36,779
Brute!

804
01:02:37,265 --> 01:02:39,859
Mothers always know
things like that.

805
01:02:42,905 --> 01:02:44,133
Maybe he's an orphan.

806
01:02:44,785 --> 01:02:46,855
The poor man!
An orphan as well!

807
01:02:47,825 --> 01:02:49,861
A communist Polish orphan,

808
01:02:50,065 --> 01:02:53,580
dying in a country whose
name he can't even pronounce.

809
01:02:55,145 --> 01:02:56,419
''lssapanias'',

810
01:02:56,905 --> 01:02:58,623
he said. Remember?

811
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:03,260
Now my makeup will run.

812
01:03:04,825 --> 01:03:07,100
l know, l know.
You're right.

813
01:03:08,025 --> 01:03:09,504
But don't get upset.

814
01:03:10,825 --> 01:03:12,224
lt happens in wars.

815
01:03:12,785 --> 01:03:14,343
''Don't get upset''?

816
01:03:15,545 --> 01:03:19,174
-You've never been a mother.
-Neither have you...

817
01:03:19,665 --> 01:03:22,133
No! You never wanted to!
Selfish!

818
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:23,899
But l tell you,

819
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:26,780
if they bring the Poles in,

820
01:03:26,985 --> 01:03:30,455
you can do this flag scene
with the lieutenant!

821
01:03:30,665 --> 01:03:31,734
l mean it!

822
01:03:32,265 --> 01:03:33,983
Fuck, am l hearing right?

823
01:03:37,865 --> 01:03:39,503
Just wait and see.

824
01:03:41,465 --> 01:03:43,262
Move over!

825
01:04:12,865 --> 01:04:14,059
Curtain down!

826
01:04:33,705 --> 01:04:35,980
lt's that nice?
The three flags.

827
01:04:36,745 --> 01:04:39,464
Germany, Spain, and ltaly.

828
01:04:39,905 --> 01:04:42,499
The Christian west
against communism,

829
01:04:42,705 --> 01:04:44,616
Judaism, and Masonry!

830
01:04:44,825 --> 01:04:47,339
-You like it?
-You're a genius!

831
01:04:47,545 --> 01:04:48,660
Modestly...

832
01:04:48,865 --> 01:04:49,900
Take it up!

833
01:04:55,025 --> 01:04:56,060
What's wrong?

834
01:04:57,265 --> 01:04:58,778
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

835
01:04:59,385 --> 01:05:01,501
Your face is white,
very pale.

836
01:05:01,825 --> 01:05:03,622
No, it's the makeup.

837
01:05:04,305 --> 01:05:05,658
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

838
01:05:07,065 --> 01:05:07,736
Lieutenant...

839
01:05:08,065 --> 01:05:09,020
What is it?

840
01:05:09,305 --> 01:05:10,499
The colonel's here.

841
01:05:10,785 --> 01:05:11,854
He's here?

842
01:05:12,065 --> 01:05:14,340
The colonel is here,
l must go.

843
01:05:14,545 --> 01:05:17,264
l'm leaving
everything in your hands.

844
01:05:17,465 --> 01:05:18,739
Yes, sir!

845
01:05:18,945 --> 01:05:21,823
Believe, obey, and fight!

846
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:24,614
Madam...

847
01:05:26,825 --> 01:05:28,224
My Spain...

848
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:31,940
which gallops and rides the wind
to build a monument

849
01:05:32,305 --> 01:05:33,897
to its brave Caudillo!

850
01:05:34,385 --> 01:05:36,899
-This is great!
-Don't start, Carmela.

851
01:05:37,385 --> 01:05:39,899
How can l sing this?
Look, Paulino.

852
01:05:40,105 --> 01:05:42,221
''Wind'' doesn't ryhme
with ''Caudillo''.

853
01:05:42,425 --> 01:05:45,974
And how can a prancer
build a monument?

854
01:05:46,425 --> 01:05:48,655
You and the rabbit
will kill me.

855
01:05:48,905 --> 01:05:50,054
l feel awful.

856
01:05:50,465 --> 01:05:52,023
Even that ass...

857
01:05:53,705 --> 01:05:56,617
Even that asshole,
the lieutenant

858
01:05:57,185 --> 01:05:59,824
noticed it.
He said l was pale.

859
01:06:00,185 --> 01:06:01,140
Pale?

860
01:06:01,545 --> 01:06:02,898
Green is more like it!

861
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:06,183
Stuffing yourself with rabbit
before a show!

862
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:10,100
-You can't trust rabbit.
-lt's never made me sick.

863
01:06:10,385 --> 01:06:12,501
And eating makes me
feel secure.

864
01:06:12,705 --> 01:06:14,104
l'll need that tonight.

865
01:06:14,305 --> 01:06:15,420
lT WAS C AT

866
01:06:16,225 --> 01:06:19,934
Little shit! He said
it was cat and that made me sick!

867
01:06:20,625 --> 01:06:22,980
Come here, l'll kill you!

868
01:06:23,185 --> 01:06:25,415
Don't take it out on him.

869
01:06:25,665 --> 01:06:26,700
And the wine?

870
01:06:30,465 --> 01:06:32,933
Brandy. This will fix me up.

871
01:06:33,425 --> 01:06:35,893
Excuse me, professors.
Carry on.

872
01:06:43,985 --> 01:06:45,703
''Poetry which pro...''

873
01:06:45,945 --> 01:06:49,335
''Poetry which has been...''
''Which has pro...''

874
01:06:49,865 --> 01:06:51,821
''Which has been produced...''

875
01:06:52,265 --> 01:06:56,383
''Poetry which has pro...''
''Which has pro...''

876
01:06:56,985 --> 01:06:58,862
''Which has been produced...''

877
01:07:01,185 --> 01:07:02,061
What?

878
01:07:02,265 --> 01:07:03,539
''...by the Uprising.''

879
01:07:17,265 --> 01:07:18,141
Paulino...

880
01:07:18,745 --> 01:07:19,894
They're here.

881
01:07:20,345 --> 01:07:21,414
The audience?

882
01:07:22,265 --> 01:07:23,334
The Poles!

883
01:07:23,705 --> 01:07:24,979
They Poles are here!

884
01:07:27,705 --> 01:07:29,104
Let's get to work.

885
01:07:29,665 --> 01:07:31,303
Don't just stand there!

886
01:07:31,785 --> 01:07:34,094
-And your beret?
-They did it!

887
01:07:34,825 --> 01:07:36,656
They brought them.

888
01:07:37,545 --> 01:07:40,105
Come on. You have
to give it your all.

889
01:07:40,305 --> 01:07:43,934
My all? With those
poor guys out there?

890
01:07:44,545 --> 01:07:47,378
You can do what you want,
l'm going home.

891
01:07:47,585 --> 01:07:49,018
l won't do the flag scene.

892
01:07:49,225 --> 01:07:51,375
Wait.
How can you go home now?

893
01:07:52,465 --> 01:07:54,774
You never cared
about the Republican flag.

894
01:07:55,225 --> 01:07:57,978
We can laugh at it or
at the king's underpants.

895
01:07:58,185 --> 01:08:00,574
We're artists.
We do what they ask.

896
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:03,936
But you never like
when they want the farts.

897
01:08:04,265 --> 01:08:06,859
Because it's undignified
for an artist.

898
01:08:07,105 --> 01:08:08,220
And this?

899
01:08:08,425 --> 01:08:11,576
What do you want?
To get all of us shot?

900
01:08:12,185 --> 01:08:13,857
To be a heroine?

901
01:08:15,385 --> 01:08:17,945
Surviving two years of war
is enough.

902
01:08:18,225 --> 01:08:20,136
-lt's all your fault.
-Mine?

903
01:08:20,345 --> 01:08:23,974
You showed off to the lieutenant,
that's why he picked us.

904
01:08:24,185 --> 01:08:28,019
-And if l hadn't?
-He would have let us go.

905
01:08:28,265 --> 01:08:31,621
Let us go? Have you forgotten
this is a war?

906
01:08:32,065 --> 01:08:34,215
Rememberthe mayor
and the school?

907
01:08:34,665 --> 01:08:36,018
Go out on the road

908
01:08:36,305 --> 01:08:38,102
and look in the ditches.

909
01:08:39,505 --> 01:08:40,699
-Here.
-No.

910
01:09:13,745 --> 01:09:16,703
Fuck! l think it's Franco.
Look.

911
01:09:18,505 --> 01:09:20,063
Short, with a moustache.

912
01:09:39,225 --> 01:09:40,738
For God's sake, Carmela.

913
01:09:43,225 --> 01:09:44,624
Let's make a deal.

914
01:09:45,305 --> 01:09:46,454
You do the show.

915
01:09:47,945 --> 01:09:50,778
Tomorrow l'll borrow
the wedding dress

916
01:09:52,985 --> 01:09:54,657
and we'll get married.

917
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:03,940
Ladies and...

918
01:11:05,385 --> 01:11:05,976
Excuse me.

919
01:11:06,185 --> 01:11:08,745
Gentlemen,
distinguished audience,

920
01:11:08,945 --> 01:11:12,017
l have great pleasure
in presenting

921
01:11:12,225 --> 01:11:14,944
the unequalled,
the inimitable,

922
01:11:15,145 --> 01:11:18,342
that star of the music hall,
Carmela!

923
01:11:20,785 --> 01:11:23,299
She will perform
that beautiful song,

924
01:11:23,505 --> 01:11:25,894
''My Spain''.
Maestro, when you're ready.

925
01:11:26,425 --> 01:11:28,302
My Spain

926
01:11:28,505 --> 01:11:32,817
gallops and rides the wind
to build a monument

927
01:11:33,545 --> 01:11:35,820
to its brave Caudillo.

928
01:11:46,425 --> 01:11:47,983
My Spain

929
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:51,581
gallops and rides the wind
to build a monument

930
01:11:51,785 --> 01:11:55,380
to its brave Caudillo.

931
01:11:55,825 --> 01:11:57,224
My Spain

932
01:11:57,425 --> 01:12:01,054
is mad with joy
because the day is drawing near

933
01:12:01,265 --> 01:12:04,302
to raise our arm
in salute.

934
01:12:36,305 --> 01:12:38,865
-Long live Germany and Hitler!
-Long live!

935
01:12:39,745 --> 01:12:42,623
-Long live ltaly and the Duce!
-Long live!

936
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:45,739
-Long live General Franco!
-Long live!

937
01:12:48,465 --> 01:12:50,262
-Long live Spain!
-Long live!

her imperial pride.

943

Yet another feat

of the many which mark

945
01:13:31,305 --> 01:13:33,500

969
01:15:06,145 --> 01:15:07,055
Excuse me.

970
01:15:08,785 --> 01:15:11,060
lt's Autumn,
l'm shedding leaves.

971
01:15:13,265 --> 01:15:16,780
What Paulino really
means to say

972
01:15:16,985 --> 01:15:18,657
is that Carmela
and Paulino

973
01:15:19,105 --> 01:15:21,903
and Gustavete as well...
Say hello...

974
01:15:22,425 --> 01:15:24,495
...are here to entertain you.

975
01:15:25,025 --> 01:15:27,220
But the disappearance
of out lorry...

976
01:15:27,425 --> 01:15:29,063
We'll say ''disappearance''...

977
01:15:29,265 --> 01:15:31,495
has left us a bit short

978
01:15:31,825 --> 01:15:35,135
so we can't give much shine
to this freedom binge.

979
01:15:36,185 --> 01:15:37,334
Some people here

980
01:15:38,345 --> 01:15:41,781
aren't free at all.
Even if you are Polish,

981
01:15:41,985 --> 01:15:43,816
a mother is a mother...

982
01:15:44,385 --> 01:15:46,979
God bless mothers!
l met you in the street.

983
01:15:47,185 --> 01:15:48,903
This is Carmela,

984
01:15:49,105 --> 01:15:50,902
a great artist

985
01:15:51,465 --> 01:15:53,740
ready to lay her art
at your feet.

986
01:15:53,945 --> 01:15:56,459
So don't try
to stomp all over it.

987
01:15:56,665 --> 01:15:58,701
The art, l mean.
Get off me!

988
01:15:59,665 --> 01:16:00,780
l was joking.

989
01:16:00,985 --> 01:16:04,136
l love an audience,
whateverthey look like.

990
01:16:04,465 --> 01:16:07,423
Now you lot, with all your
swords and medals,

991
01:16:07,625 --> 01:16:09,343
poker-faced and important,

992
01:16:09,545 --> 01:16:12,662
for me it's as if
you were my cousin whose

993
01:16:12,865 --> 01:16:14,662
willie was always
hanging out.

994
01:16:18,545 --> 01:16:19,944

Judas! Do you want
to destroy me?

What the hell's going on?

1003
01:16:54,025 --> 01:16:56,380
-What?
-Something unforeseen.

1004
01:16:56,585 --> 01:16:58,416

A drop, just a drop.

1006
01:17:00,945 --> 01:17:02,583
lt's her period.

1007
01:17:04,185 --> 01:17:07,018
What the hell is that?
Lowerthe curtain!

1008
01:17:07,225 --> 01:17:08,499
The castle!

1009
01:17:10,105 --> 01:17:11,220
What's a ''period''?

1010
01:17:12,185 --> 01:17:14,415
The thing...

1011
01:17:15,225 --> 01:17:16,294
You know...

1012
01:17:18,505 --> 01:17:19,654
She suffers a lot.

1013
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:22,900
But l promise that
from here on,

1014
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:24,663
everything will be fine.

1015
01:17:24,865 --> 01:17:27,663
Fine. But no more drink.
Please, Carmela.

1016
01:17:28,305 --> 01:17:29,340
Not a drop.

1017
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:31,940
Tune that guitar.
Here, let me.

1018
01:17:34,305 --> 01:17:36,375
-Damnit! Tune it!
-Let's go!

1019
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:38,382
Raise the curtain!

1020
01:17:54,265 --> 01:17:57,337
Glancing at random
through the epic poetry

1021
01:17:57,545 --> 01:18:00,218
inspired by
the Glorious Uprising,

1022
01:18:05,025 --> 01:18:08,495
we came across
''The Ballad of Castile in Arms''

1023
01:18:08,705 --> 01:18:10,297
by Frederico de Urrutia.

1024
01:18:15,865 --> 01:18:18,777
l am greatly honored
to recite it for you.

1025
01:18:26,745 --> 01:18:28,656
''On the Hill
of the Angels

1026
01:18:29,185 --> 01:18:30,982
which angels guard,

1027
01:18:31,745 --> 01:18:33,781
they have shot Jesus!

1028
01:18:34,145 --> 01:18:36,340
The stones are bleeding.

1029
01:18:37,065 --> 01:18:38,783
But fear not, mother,

1030
01:18:38,985 --> 01:18:40,816
all Castile is in arms!

1031
01:18:41,505 --> 01:18:43,860
We can see Madrid
in the distance.

1032
01:18:44,105 --> 01:18:46,619
Franco is here! Up with Spain!

1033
01:18:47,585 --> 01:18:50,258
The Red hydra is dying,
trapped by bayonets,

1034
01:18:51,065 --> 01:18:54,819
its flesh is torn
and its jaw shattered.

1035
01:18:55,265 --> 01:18:59,178
And the Cid, star of iron,
rides through the heavens.

1036
01:19:00,225 --> 01:19:01,180
Far away

1037
01:19:02,345 --> 01:19:03,460
in the village,

1038
01:19:04,545 --> 01:19:06,263
beneath the gilded church,

1039
01:19:06,585 --> 01:19:08,303
next to camp fires,

1040
01:19:09,105 --> 01:19:10,902
thousands of mothers pray

1041
01:19:11,105 --> 01:19:13,573
for sons who
marched away.''

1042
01:19:14,065 --> 01:19:16,533
Aren't there mothers
in Poland?

1043
01:19:16,745 --> 01:19:18,019
''...the war is ours.

1044
01:19:18,705 --> 01:19:21,173
Before the wheat has grown,

1045
01:19:21,385 --> 01:19:23,501
l shall return
on the old track,

1046
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:25,861
and there will be
celebrations.

1047
01:19:26,065 --> 01:19:28,135
The bells will ring out,

1048
01:19:28,345 --> 01:19:32,577
the girls will rejoice,
and guitars will sound their joy.

1049
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:36,257
There will be parades
and drums and flutes,

1050
01:19:36,465 --> 01:19:38,774
and Falangist flags
overthe church.

1051
01:19:38,985 --> 01:19:42,375
Madrid is at hand,
all Castile is in arms!

1052
01:19:42,625 --> 01:19:45,662
The Cid, in a blue shirt,
rides the heavens!''

1053
01:20:00,825 --> 01:20:03,100
-Bravo! Sublime!
-Thank you.

1054
01:20:03,305 --> 01:20:04,181
The Saracen

1055
01:20:04,385 --> 01:20:05,340
garden!

1056
01:20:06,745 --> 01:20:09,179
That was beautiful.
You made me cry.

1057
01:20:09,425 --> 01:20:11,017
You're on now.

1058
01:20:11,225 --> 01:20:12,374
Don't do anything crazy.

1059
01:20:12,585 --> 01:20:13,938
l'm all right now.

1060
01:20:14,145 --> 01:20:17,023
And don't forget,
l'm a professional.

1061
01:20:17,865 --> 01:20:20,140
-How do l look?
-Like a queen.

1062
01:20:41,985 --> 01:20:45,057
There is a sadness

1063
01:20:45,945 --> 01:20:49,381
deep within me.

1064
01:20:50,225 --> 01:20:53,854
When l am far away from you,

1065
01:20:54,465 --> 01:20:58,174
my heart is torn in two.

1066
01:21:00,665 --> 01:21:03,054
The sun can never

1067
01:21:04,745 --> 01:21:07,623
cheer me

1068
01:21:09,065 --> 01:21:12,944
far from that Spanish orchard.
My love,

1069
01:21:13,345 --> 01:21:16,781
like a flower,
will ever bloom.

1070
01:21:17,345 --> 01:21:20,815
l shall carry you
within my soul,

1071
01:21:21,545 --> 01:21:24,935
cradle of glory, valor,
and nobility.

1072
01:21:25,305 --> 01:21:28,820
Spain, l shall never
see you more,

1073
01:21:29,465 --> 01:21:33,344
my heart sighs with grief.

1074
01:21:33,785 --> 01:21:37,494
lf the wind should carry
to you

1075
01:21:37,945 --> 01:21:41,301
this lament
of my bitter grief,

1076
01:21:41,745 --> 01:21:44,782
Spain, send it back to me
with love,

1077
01:21:46,065 --> 01:21:48,625
Spain, the love
of my heart.

1078
01:21:57,705 --> 01:22:00,902
There is a sadness

1079
01:22:02,065 --> 01:22:03,464
deep within me.

1080
01:22:06,185 --> 01:22:09,894
When l am far away from you,

1081
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:14,020
my heart is torn in two.

1082
01:22:16,585 --> 01:22:19,304
The sun will never

1083
01:22:20,585 --> 01:22:22,894
shine on me,

1084
01:22:24,745 --> 01:22:28,579
never again will l see
your soil,

1085
01:22:28,865 --> 01:22:32,096
far from you,
of grief l shall die.

1086
01:22:37,225 --> 01:22:39,898
Spain of mine.

1087
01:22:40,825 --> 01:22:44,420
l can no longer
look on you,

1088
01:22:44,945 --> 01:22:47,379
you are my guiding light,

1089
01:22:47,585 --> 01:22:49,576
l sigh for you,

1090
01:22:49,785 --> 01:22:52,174
you are all my joy.

1091
01:22:53,065 --> 01:22:56,341
Night and day,

1092
01:22:56,985 --> 01:22:59,977
you're ever in my mind.

1093
01:23:01,345 --> 01:23:03,779
lf only l could,

1094
01:23:05,225 --> 01:23:07,614
if only l could return!

1095
01:23:09,265 --> 01:23:13,383
What would l give to see myself,
O land of mine,

1096
01:23:13,585 --> 01:23:16,224
in your blue sky!

1097
01:23:16,905 --> 01:23:20,136
ln my solitude

1098
01:23:20,985 --> 01:23:24,375
l sigh for you.

1099
01:23:24,905 --> 01:23:27,977
Spain, l die for you.

1100
01:23:28,905 --> 01:23:32,420
Spain, my sun and my star,

1101
01:23:32,905 --> 01:23:36,341
l carry you hidden

1102
01:23:36,945 --> 01:23:40,460
deep within me.

1103
01:23:40,905 --> 01:23:44,454
Would that l could cross
the wide seas,

1104
01:23:44,665 --> 01:23:48,135
Spain, flower of my life!

1105
01:24:22,185 --> 01:24:23,300
Goose pimples.

1106
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:25,499
My skin, l mean.

1107
01:24:26,265 --> 01:24:28,335
l get goose pimples

1108
01:24:28,665 --> 01:24:30,064
when l sing that song.

1109
01:24:31,145 --> 01:24:32,260
Don't you?

1110
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:35,658
But l get emotional
about everything.

1111
01:24:36,305 --> 01:24:39,775
Paulino says l'm just hysterical.
What does he know?

1112
01:24:39,985 --> 01:24:42,579
He never gets excited.

1113
01:24:42,865 --> 01:24:44,821
Well, sometimes he does.

1114
01:24:46,385 --> 01:24:47,977
lf you knew...

1115
01:24:48,865 --> 01:24:51,698
Paulino! How about
a trip to Uruguay?

1116
01:24:54,185 --> 01:24:55,743
To Uruguay? Why not?

1117
01:24:55,945 --> 01:24:58,539
Carmela could sing
the whole night!

1118
01:24:58,745 --> 01:25:02,055
Yes, especially for
those boys up there,

1119
01:25:02,265 --> 01:25:04,301
who don't understand a word.

1120
01:25:04,665 --> 01:25:07,657
-Art has no borders, Carmela.
-And yet...

1121
01:25:08,105 --> 01:25:10,255
''Sighs for Spain''
moved them.

1122
01:25:10,465 --> 01:25:12,342
To Uruguay!
One, two, three!

1123
01:25:15,825 --> 01:25:17,304
Devil of a man!

1124
01:25:20,345 --> 01:25:22,905
l do believe
l know you.

1125
01:25:23,665 --> 01:25:26,020
-From where?
-l saw you yesterday...

1126
01:25:26,505 --> 01:25:28,939
-On the tram.
-Oh, indeed?

1127
01:25:29,385 --> 01:25:30,579
You surprise me.

1128
01:25:31,185 --> 01:25:34,655
l only travel
in a hansom cab.

1129
01:25:35,785 --> 01:25:37,184
l'm the handsome

1130
01:25:38,585 --> 01:25:39,620
one.

1131
01:25:47,745 --> 01:25:50,976
-Do you travel much?
-That depends.

1132
01:25:51,385 --> 01:25:53,774
-On what?
-On the company.

1133
01:25:53,985 --> 01:25:57,694
Well, l would ask
that you come with me.

1134
01:25:57,905 --> 01:25:58,576
Where to?

1135
01:26:03,345 --> 01:26:05,063
To...

1136
01:26:05,265 --> 01:26:10,020
Uruguay.

1137
01:26:10,225 --> 01:26:12,580
To Uruguay?

1138
01:26:12,825 --> 01:26:15,703
To Uruguay, guay,

1139
01:26:17,385 --> 01:26:18,784
l shan't go, go,

1140
01:26:18,985 --> 01:26:22,773
because l can't swim.
To Uruguay, guay,

1141
01:26:22,985 --> 01:26:25,135
l shan't go, go,

1142
01:26:25,345 --> 01:26:28,417
because l can't swim.

1143
01:26:28,945 --> 01:26:31,300
Take me to Paris

1144
01:26:31,905 --> 01:26:33,975
if you don't mind.

1145
01:26:34,625 --> 01:26:37,742
To Uruguay, guay,
l shan't go, go,

1146
01:26:37,945 --> 01:26:40,254
because l can't

1147
01:26:40,705 --> 01:26:41,979
swim!

1148
01:26:43,705 --> 01:26:45,582
Let's move on.

1149
01:26:45,785 --> 01:26:48,094
And now,
''Faceta Nera''.

1150
01:26:48,865 --> 01:26:49,854
Thank you.

1151
01:26:52,105 --> 01:26:54,016
Thank you, thank you.

1152
01:26:54,225 --> 01:26:56,500
And now, we leave the stage

1153
01:26:56,705 --> 01:27:00,300
to the ltalian choir
directed by Lt. Ripamonte,

1154
01:27:00,505 --> 01:27:03,702
who will perform the famous song
''Faceta Nera''

1155
01:27:04,665 --> 01:27:07,782
in honor of their soldiers
fallen in battle.

1156
01:27:53,865 --> 01:27:55,457
They're beyond hope.

1157
01:27:55,985 --> 01:27:57,384
A bunch of fairies.

1158
01:28:22,225 --> 01:28:24,455
You were wonderful, Carmela.

1159
01:28:24,665 --> 01:28:25,939
You really think so?

1160
01:28:29,145 --> 01:28:31,022
You liked it, too,
Gustavete?

1161
01:28:31,305 --> 01:28:32,454
What about me?

1162
01:28:34,225 --> 01:28:36,739
l did it for
those poor Poles.

1163
01:28:37,225 --> 01:28:40,422
-To remember us by.
-Forget the Poles!

1164
01:28:40,785 --> 01:28:43,379
When you were talking,
l almost shat myself!

1165
01:28:48,905 --> 01:28:49,894
Look at that.

1166
01:28:55,585 --> 01:28:57,940
Leave that alone, damnit!

1167
01:28:58,865 --> 01:29:00,617
We have to get dressed.

1168
01:29:00,865 --> 01:29:03,504
We're on after
that damn lieutenant.

1169
01:29:04,225 --> 01:29:05,658
The flag number?

1170
01:29:06,905 --> 01:29:08,463
We've no choice, Carmela.

1171
01:29:10,185 --> 01:29:11,982
Keep your spirits up.

1172
01:29:58,745 --> 01:30:00,258
Long live the Duce!

1173
01:30:06,745 --> 01:30:10,135
Colonel, officers,
soldiers, everyone...

1174
01:30:10,625 --> 01:30:12,217
l'm pleased to inform you

1175
01:30:12,425 --> 01:30:15,735
our next act, ''The Republic
goes to the Doctor'',

1176
01:30:15,945 --> 01:30:18,903
is dedicated to
the prisoners here.

1177
01:30:19,145 --> 01:30:20,578
l give you...

1178
01:30:20,785 --> 01:30:23,219
Carmela and Paulino,
Tip-top Variety.

1179
01:30:33,905 --> 01:30:36,783
What a pity.
l actually prefer men.

1180
01:30:37,585 --> 01:30:39,576
Enough, enough, enough!

1181
01:30:39,785 --> 01:30:41,662
l won't see more women today.

1182
01:30:41,865 --> 01:30:43,583
Success is killing me.

1183
01:30:44,305 --> 01:30:46,216
The surgery's full of women.

1184
01:30:46,425 --> 01:30:48,336
How cruel life can be!

1185
01:30:48,545 --> 01:30:50,581
lt's all because
of my name.

1186
01:30:50,785 --> 01:30:53,777
lt attracts them like
bees round a honey pot.

1187
01:30:54,425 --> 01:30:55,540
What am l called?

1188
01:30:56,145 --> 01:30:57,737
Angel Touchmeup.

1189
01:31:00,145 --> 01:31:02,101
Father, l hate you!

1190
01:31:02,305 --> 01:31:05,775
Why wasn't l called Fernández
like everyone else?

1191
01:31:06,785 --> 01:31:09,345
Someone at the door!
lt'll be Ramón!

1192
01:31:11,505 --> 01:31:12,824
Open up, doctor.

1193
01:31:13,665 --> 01:31:15,257
l'm not in!

1194
01:31:15,465 --> 01:31:17,183
You are.
l know your voice

1195
01:31:17,385 --> 01:31:19,262
from the radio.

1196
01:31:19,465 --> 01:31:22,616
What a predicament.
Well, whatever God wills.

1197
01:31:26,545 --> 01:31:28,103
Hello, Dr. Touchmeup.

1198
01:31:28,305 --> 01:31:31,695
''Dr. Touchmeup,
always on the up-and-up''.

1199
01:31:31,905 --> 01:31:34,897
l'm called
''The Spanish Republic'',

1200
01:31:35,105 --> 01:31:37,858
and l'm very sick,
very, very sick.

1201
01:31:38,065 --> 01:31:40,181
And what's wrong with you?

1202
01:31:40,385 --> 01:31:42,341
l'm feverish, very feverish.

1203
01:31:42,545 --> 01:31:44,501
Stick yourthermometer in.

1204
01:31:44,785 --> 01:31:47,777
l'm sorry,
but my thermometer's broken.

1205
01:31:50,145 --> 01:31:51,976
That doesn't matter.

1206
01:31:52,185 --> 01:31:55,461
Stick it in me
and l'll make it work.

1207
01:31:55,665 --> 01:31:59,340
And your husband can't
put it in for you?

1208
01:31:59,665 --> 01:32:01,860
That Russian
isn't my husband,

1209
01:32:02,065 --> 01:32:03,783
and he's had enough
already.

1210
01:32:03,985 --> 01:32:06,374
Russian, like caviar.

1211
01:32:06,705 --> 01:32:08,775
lt's his fault l'm like this.

1212
01:32:08,985 --> 01:32:11,294
l must examine you.
Strip.

1213
01:32:11,905 --> 01:32:12,974
l'm ashamed.

1214
01:32:13,185 --> 01:32:16,018
Sorry, you must
take off your clothes.

1215
01:32:16,625 --> 01:32:17,774
l won't look.

1216
01:32:19,745 --> 01:32:21,019
Whatever you say.

1217
01:32:24,665 --> 01:32:25,302
Whore!

1218
01:32:25,505 --> 01:32:27,257
Bitch! Slut!

1219
01:32:28,345 --> 01:32:29,221
Get off!

1220
01:32:29,425 --> 01:32:31,575
-Whore!
-Out of the Republic!

1221
01:32:31,785 --> 01:32:32,297
Bitch!

1222
01:32:32,705 --> 01:32:34,184
-Get off!
-Get her off!

1223
01:32:34,945 --> 01:32:36,458
Whore! Bitch!

1224
01:32:37,625 --> 01:32:38,660
Slut!

1225
01:32:39,585 --> 01:32:41,541
What's with the projector?

1226
01:32:45,025 --> 01:32:47,539
Oh, how dreadful!

1227
01:32:48,105 --> 01:32:50,335
l don't like
those colors at all.

1228
01:32:50,825 --> 01:32:52,543
Especially that purple.

1229
01:32:53,265 --> 01:32:55,495
lt's obvious
you've been poisoned.

1230
01:32:55,705 --> 01:32:57,661
No, l was born like this.

1231
01:32:58,745 --> 01:33:01,213
-Explain yourself.
-You see, doctor...

1232
01:33:01,425 --> 01:33:04,144
My being born
was an accident,

1233
01:33:04,385 --> 01:33:06,182
a bit of a slip-up.

1234
01:33:06,545 --> 01:33:07,898
On April 14th...

1235
01:33:09,945 --> 01:33:12,982
An indiscretion.
You know, in Springtime...

1236
01:33:13,945 --> 01:33:17,301
The mid-wife may
have done something wrong.

1237
01:33:17,505 --> 01:33:19,973
Maybe she was
just incompetent.

1238
01:33:20,505 --> 01:33:21,620
That could be.

1239
01:33:23,865 --> 01:33:26,220
l can see
some blotches...

1240
01:33:26,425 --> 01:33:27,983
some red blotches.

1241
01:33:28,745 --> 01:33:31,213
Has the Bolshevik
infected you?

1242
01:33:31,425 --> 01:33:32,699
You should ask him.

1243
01:33:33,585 --> 01:33:35,337
He put his thermometer in.

1244
01:33:35,545 --> 01:33:38,696
Did he put it in
from the front

1245
01:33:38,905 --> 01:33:40,463
or from behind?

1246
01:33:40,665 --> 01:33:43,304
Stick it in
your fucking mother!

1247
01:33:43,505 --> 01:33:44,733
Goddamn faggot!

1248
01:33:46,305 --> 01:33:47,738
We fight against the Moors...

1249
01:33:48,905 --> 01:33:50,304
This is intolerable!

1250
01:33:53,745 --> 01:33:58,216
Legionnaires and fascists.
Oh, Carmela, oh, Carmela...

1251
01:33:59,545 --> 01:34:00,182
Whore!

1252
01:34:00,625 --> 01:34:01,535
Get out!

1253
01:34:13,825 --> 01:34:14,940
Whore! Bitch!

1254
01:34:15,145 --> 01:34:18,217
And you hit them!
What did you expect

1255
01:34:18,425 --> 01:34:20,859
if you make fun of them?

1256
01:34:22,985 --> 01:34:24,179
You bastards!

1257
01:34:28,665 --> 01:34:30,178
Don't hit them!

1258
01:34:30,465 --> 01:34:31,818
Don't hit them!

1259
01:34:32,905 --> 01:34:34,782
-Have you no hearts?
-Shut up!

1260
01:34:35,105 --> 01:34:36,982
Why not kill them decently?

1261
01:34:37,185 --> 01:34:38,220
Bastards!

1262
01:35:59,385 --> 01:36:01,296
Come on, Paulino.

1263
01:36:12,665 --> 01:36:14,815
We fight against
the Moors.

1264
01:36:16,465 --> 01:36:18,581
We fight against
the Moors,

1265
01:36:20,225 --> 01:36:21,977
the legionnaires
and fascists.

1266
01:36:22,185 --> 01:36:26,019
Oh, Carmela,
oh, Carmela.

1267
01:36:26,385 --> 01:36:28,216
Legionnaires and fascists.

1268
01:36:28,425 --> 01:36:31,940
Oh, Carmela,
oh, Carmela.

1269
01:36:55,225 --> 01:36:57,341
On the Gandesa front,

1270
01:36:59,025 --> 01:37:01,175
on the Gandesa front,

1271
01:37:02,785 --> 01:37:06,380
we don't have ammunition,
tanks, or cannons.

1272
01:37:06,585 --> 01:37:08,974
Oh, Carmela.

1273
01:37:09,305 --> 01:37:15,932
