    My particle accelerator!

16
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:48,781
          So, Dr Eggman,
  does this particle accelerator

17
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,750
have any distinguishing features
that would help us identify it?

18
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:56,255
  Let's see... It has a small
   scratch on its left side.

19
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,389
        So there's that.

20
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,526
          And also...
  it's a particle accelerator!

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,262
  You got a lot of those roaming
   the streets of your village?

22
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,563
          Hmm, genius?

23
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,133
 I'm sorry. I'm just so upset.

24
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,637
  I've never seen him like this.
         I kinda like it!

25
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:15,307
    And this is Dr Eggman's
         Think-ubator,

26
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:19,678
  the room where he "hatches"
  his brilliant ideas. Get it?

27
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:26,351
      Pearls before swine.

28
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,253
      And it was from here

29
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:32,524
        that Dr Eggman's
particle accelerator was stolen.

30
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,692
             (Gasp)

31
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:35,727
 Not his particle accelerator!

32
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,731
 I was hoping to get a picture
   with it. This tour bites.

33
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,533
     It was about yay big.

34
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,869
          It was made
     of polished titanium.

35
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,805
   It accelerated particles.
   Am I leaving anything out?

36
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,775
         (Slurps) Someone
 want to remind me why I'm here?

37
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,844
     Because you stole it!

38
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:52,811
             (Gasp)

39
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,380
          - That's nuts.
       - If it wasn't you,

40
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:59,685
        why was my lair
littered with chili dogs scraps?

41
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,652
             (Gasp)

42
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,488
            I dunno.

43
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,357
             (Gasp)

44
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,893
 And look at these footprints!

45
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:10,295
             (Gasp)

46
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,735
             (Gasp)

47
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,737
          Would you stop
      gasping dramatically?

48
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,339
             (Gasp)

49
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:23,308
  Seriously, guys. I'm the hero.
        He's the villain.

50
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:26,478
   I mean, he has an evil lair!
    He has mindless henchmen!

51
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,281
         - No offence.
  - No, you're onto something.

52
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,884
       Sorry, Dr Eggman.
  I'd love to close this case,

53
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,553
 but before I can arrest Sonic
      I'm gonna need more!

54
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:36,889
           Like, uh,
 if this was part of a pattern.

55
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,757
              Sarge,
   where shall I put this crate

56
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,827
of recent photos of crime scenes
where partially eaten chili dogs

57
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,629
  and Sonic-shaped footprints
          were found?

58
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,796
             (Gasp)

59
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,433
That'll do it. Sonic T Hedgehog,
     you are under arrest!

60
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,369
       You have the right
       to remain silent.

61
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,470
             (Gasp)

62
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,839
           - (Chuckles)
    - You leave me no choice.

63
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:56,909
     I'll find the real thief
   and clear my name. Know why?

64
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,410
             Hero!

65
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,312
              Oh!

66
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,849
     So, uh, who wants to see
         the rumpus room?

67
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,150
             (Gasp)

68
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:09,254
         I demand action!
  Sonic stole my walking stick!

69
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,822
       And my jewellery!

70
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,559
        He stole my keys
and hid them in my sofa cushion!

71
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,960
       OK, I lost my keys

72
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,962
and found them three days later
        in the cushion.

73
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:20,432
- But we should get him anyway!
   - We should form a posse.

74
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,701
  Everyone, please calm down!

75
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:25,270
      This is not the time
      for rash behaviour!

76
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,705
   When would be a good time?

77
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,308
I like to plan my rash behaviour
          in advance.

78
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,578
      How about I bake up
  a batch of my famous cookies

79
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:33,946
and put them on the windowsill?

80
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,848
     Sonic will smell them
     and come to steal one.

81
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,319
     But he won't know that
they're laced with poison, so...

82
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,487
- We're not trying to kill him.
             - Oh.

83
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,856
 (Chuckles) I'm so embarrassed.

84
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,958
         Have a cookie.

85
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,626
        (Grating noise)

86
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,598
            I'll catch
      this Hedgehog for you,

87
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,633
  but it ain't gonna be easy.

88
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,702
Don't worry, we'll all pitch in.

89
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,905
   No! Unlike tying my shoes
     or brushing my teeth,

90
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,641
       I have to do this
       without any help.

91
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,346
           (Strains)

92
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,584
      Uh, you have to pull
      and jiggle the knob.

93
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,420
   I am pulling and jiggling!

94
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,991
      I'll use the window.

95
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,492
            (Groans)

96
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,427
      (Door squeaks open)

97
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,838
  Whoa, slow down there, Bob!

98
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,873
   You're making the rest of us
            look bad.

99
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,542
          (Bell rings)

100
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,012
  Sorry, Earl. Just trying to
finish so I can knock off early.

101
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,681
  Big plans tonight? Not like
 there's much to do around here

102
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,050
  - 'cept playin' horseshoes.
      - Oops! Sorry, Earl!

103
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,919
   I'm on the trail of a man
       that did me wrong.

104
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,922
        That so? You know,
 a fella just came through town.

105
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,557
      In a real hurry too.

106
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,394
   Headed into the East Forest,
             yonder.

107
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,897
       Well, them crates
 ain't gonna stack themselves.

108
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,767
  Unless they're self-stacking
  crates. Ha! That'd be sweet.

109
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:04,736
          Sorry, Earl!

110
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,407
          Earl? Earl?

111
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,480
              Hmm.

112
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,951
    Mmm-hmm. Sonic was here.

113
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:20,952
        (Twig breaking)

114
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,656
           (Screams)

115
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,992
   Oh! How did you track me?

116
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,028
  We followed the trail of twigs
         covered in spit.

117
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,031
     Oh! Stop following me!

118
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,666
       I don't need help!

119
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,338
      This is a shortcut.

120
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,874
        - What is it, Doc?
     - The scientific term is

121
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,077
      he got hit in the head
     by too many horseshoes.

122
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,879
     - You gotta help him!
          - Oh, sure.

123
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:51,616
      Let me just whip up
  some anti-horseshoe elixir!

124
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,485
  Hey, if you can't help him,
          just say so.

125
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,521
No, seriously. I've got a recipe
   for anti-horseshoe elixir.

126
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,023
          I just need
     some pink-orchid root.

127
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,092
       But it only grows
      in the West Forest.

128
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:03,428
    Oh, I don't suppose that's
  anywhere near the East Forest?

129
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,999
   If I'm gonna catch the guy
that framed me, I gotta go east.

130
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,569
    But if I want to help you,
         I gotta go west.

131
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:13,105
       Excuse me, ma'am.
   I'm looking for this guy.

132
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,640
      Goes by the name Sonic
       and he's very fast.

133
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,509
    Oh, kinda like that guy.

134
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,145
      Hey, wait a second!

135
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:23,081
  I bet that guy knows Sonic.

136
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,654
      Ah, the pink orchid!
      Well, that was easy.

137
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,490
        I was expecting
   some kind of complication.

138
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,993
         Kinda like that.
      Knuckles, is that you?

139
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,129
  Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

140
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,765
     - But it is. Who's this?
             - Sonic.

141
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:43,034
 Oh, sorry. I didn't recognise
you with a basket on your head.

142
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,904
- Dude, I didn't steal anything!
           - I know!

143
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,739
      But there's a posse
         on your tail.

144
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,040
   I don't want to lose you.

145
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,143
     You're a valuable member
        of Team Knuckles!

146
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,612
         Team Knu... ?
   I'm not even gonna argue.

147
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:57,182
- Let's get this orchid to Earl.
  - Right. Just one question.

148
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:00,886
 Who's Earl, what's an orchid,
    and... and where are we?

149
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,858
Here you go, Doc. Am I too late?

150
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:07,926
       Don't worry, Bob.

151
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,928
         I'll fix up Earl
     newer'n a summer cricket

152
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,797
 whistlin' on fallin' dewdrop.

153
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,098
      - Know what I mean?
         - Not at all.

154
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,967
But we've got no time to waste.
       Come on, Knuckles.

155
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,136
      Hey! I know those guys
         from somewhere.

156
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,773
       There goes Sonic!
And he's taken Knuckles hostage!

157
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,609
            - (Gasp)
            - Sorry!

158
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,448
     Look, Sonic. It's you!

159
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,186
         Where'd he go?

160
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,790
          - Metal Sonic!
           - Allow me.

161
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,501
           (Whirring)

162
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,771
    Oh. That can't be good.

163
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,074
       Knucks, look out!

164
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:08,787
 Ugh! My cupcakes are missing,
        Grandma! Ha, ha!

165
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,157
   You're gonna regret that.

166
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,137
        - (Metallic sound)
             - Uh-oh.

167
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,022
      Don't you just hate
       when that happens?

168
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:49,861
     I can do this all day.

169
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,871
 Eggman's particle accelerator?

170
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,207
     That's just cheating!
 How do you live with yourself?

171
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:10,582
          Uh-oh again.

172
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,034
           (Panting)

173
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,274
  I guess when you get tired,
     you can just recharge.

174
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,112
     That's the difference
   between you and me, Metal.

175
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,982
       I don't get tired.

176
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,631
             Sorry!

177
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,140
I got a little something for ya,
             Eggie.

178
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,775
            I found
   your particle accelerator

179
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,811
       and all the stuff
that was stolen from the village

180
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,313
   and brought it back, which
proves I didn't steal any of it!

181
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,283
          - Case closed!
  - He's got you there, Egghead!

182
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:22,153
 Case not closed! You have it,
therefore you must've stolen it!

183
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:25,023
        - Now case closed!
   - He's got you there, Sonic!

184
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,793
   Officer, arrest this man!

185
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,266
              - Bob!
             - Earl?

186
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,103
 This landed by the warehouse.
  I thought you might need it.

187
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,638
     That's the real thief.

188
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,309
  Not him! My robot duplicate
 that Eggman used to frame me.

189
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,878
           All lies!
   Now, if you'll excuse me,

190
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,781
  I'll take my metal duplicate
  of you suitable for framing

191
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,317
  and my particle accelerator
            and go.

192
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,388
        - Thanks, Earl.
  - It's the least I could do

193
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,223
    after you saved my life.

194
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,092
    I was deader'n a peapod
   in a mud bucket tea kettle

195
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,328
             after
flippidyhoodledoopfazzlebazzle!

196
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,432
           (Laughter)

197
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,003
 We're closing in on him, boys,

198
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,172
     and we're not leaving
    this forest without him!

199
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,107
          (Wolf howls)

200
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,244
    Or we could go home now.

200
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:26,748
