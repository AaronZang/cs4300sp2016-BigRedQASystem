he always stands up.

What do you always write
in the notebook? Poetry?

bandits and monarchists.

Bandits beat them with sticks,
knives ... and knuckles.

170
00:17:24,181 --> 00:17:28,022
They were deliberately beaten with skill - 
to death.

171
00:17:28,322 --> 00:17:31,183
And they could not do anything.

172
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:38,437
They were beautiful, intelligent, they knew
how to argue, but you know ...

173
00:17:38,737 --> 00:17:42,217
... they did not know how to fight. On that day,
they killed my brother, too.

174

There are some bandits in the mountains.

485
00:50:13,027 --> 00:50:14,430
We must be on alert!

486
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:19,732
Move, move!

487
00:50:26,032 --> 00:50:29,217
- What have you got in the bag?
- Nothing. Just things!

488
00:50:29,517 --> 00:50:31,448
I'll check it out.

489
00:50:31,748 --> 00:50:33,560

490
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:36,037
Oh, who returned to us! Farhad!

491
00:50:41,337 --> 00:50:44,721
Well, Red Farhad, you are back?

492
00:50:45,021 --> 00:50:46,448
To the square! Go!

493
00:50:52,748 --> 00:50:55,334
- What a strange village.
- Uh-huh.

494
00:50:55,634 --> 00:50:57,976
The order is executed. Farhad is caught.

495
00:51:03,276 --> 00:51:06,289
I'll leave you for a while.
Ahmadjan!

496
00:51:06,589 --> 00:51:10,199
- Entertain the guest. Bring some tea.
- Yes, sir.

497
00:51:11,499 --> 00:51:14,003
Would you like some more tea, Comrade Khromov?

498
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:17,563
No, thank you.
Can we play something?

499
00:51:17,863 --> 00:51:18,966
What?

500
00:51:20,266 --> 00:51:25,000
There is a Russian game - called
"Bug". I can teach you.

501

<i>This servant belouhih,
their faithful dog!</i>

504
00:51:38,218 --> 00:51:41,973
He abused the Shariah!

505
00:51:42,273 --> 00:51:44,926
He wanted to run,

506
00:51:45,226 --> 00:51:49,303
but nobody can escape his own
fate!

507
00:51:49,603 --> 00:51:54,151
No one will escape the hands of
justice! No one!

508
00:51:58,451 --> 00:52:01,318
But I am merciful, and will spare you.

509

<i>I'll spare you. They deceived.</i>

510

Do you regret your actions?

Do not be afraid of those scoundrels!

513
00:52:17,474 --> 00:52:19,631
Today or tomorrow our team will
come

514
00:52:19,931 --> 00:52:21,446
and save us.

515
00:52:21,746 --> 00:52:25,676
Do you see, how deluded is
this man?

516
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:29,103
Each disease is treated by
its own medicine.

517
00:52:29,403 --> 00:52:32,188
Let this unfortunate
be helped by our contempt!

Brother, it is better to die than to endure
such a disgrace!

523
00:52:51,646 --> 00:52:53,794

[Crying] They will kill my brother!

526
00:53:06,357 --> 00:53:10,902
- Stop crying. What is your name?
- Zumrat.

527
00:53:12,202 --> 00:53:16,171
- Who are these people Zumrat?
- Bandits.

528
00:53:16,471 --> 00:53:18,831
They came two nights ago.

529
00:53:19,131 --> 00:53:20,971
Killed every communists.

530
00:53:21,272 --> 00:53:24,063
Only my brother escaped.
And their leader ...

531
00:53:24,363 --> 00:53:25,917
I know him.

532
00:53:27,017 --> 00:53:29,394
He killed my father.

533
00:53:29,694 --> 00:53:31,383
His name is Jafar.

534
00:53:33,683 --> 00:53:34,771

536
00:53:39,438 --> 00:53:41,916
Well, the competition will start tomorrow?

537
00:53:42,216 --> 00:53:44,876
Enough, Khromov. There will be no competition.

538
00:53:45,076 --> 00:53:47,304
Then let's talk frankly, Jafar.

539
00:53:47,604 --> 00:53:49,170
You guessed it.
I like you.

540
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:50,490
Very nice.

541
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:53,472
I need the "scroll of Tai"!

542
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,763
What scroll?

543
00:53:56,063 --> 00:53:59,922
Do not pretend to be an ass, Khromov.
You are not convincing.

544
00:54:00,222 --> 00:54:01,687
Why do you seek death

545
00:54:01,987 --> 00:54:06,008
in a forsaken village like
Lyakum? It is stupid.

546
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:08,478
You're a scientist, a modern man.

547
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:11,998
The scroll is not for you.
This is the art of killing.

548
00:54:12,298 --> 00:54:13,365
Do you agree?

549
00:54:16,665 --> 00:54:19,419
No, this is the art of life!

550
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:24,536
Life ...

551
00:54:24,836 --> 00:54:27,399
Anarchy breaks out.

552
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:31,389
The world order is violated,
and in order to restore it,

553
00:54:31,689 --> 00:54:33,808
killing should be done without mercy.

554
00:54:34,108 --> 00:54:37,646
- Fear is a good medicine!
- Medicine?

555
00:54:38,946 --> 00:54:41,328
But you yourself are afraid, Jafar!

556
00:54:41,628 --> 00:54:45,069
And no scrolls will save you from that.

557
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:47,013
I could have been the one ...

558
00:54:48,313 --> 00:54:50,533
- I need to think.
- Think then.

559
00:54:50,833 --> 00:54:52,895
Think about it. And also consider the boy.

560
00:54:53,195 --> 00:54:56,469
They will suffer before they are killed.

Yulchi: - I will kill this man!

We need to save Khromov.

Zumrat where are they holding your brother?

567
00:55:14,998 --> 00:55:17,623
In the old smithy. What are you thinking?

568
00:55:18,923 --> 00:55:21,411
- Take off your clothes!
- A? - Fast!

Do not be afraid, I am not a man.
My name is Lilah.

Look away! What are you looking at?

00:55:28,828 --> 00:55:31,574
- How much further?
- Over there, behind the bridge.

Ivan Vasilievich, please start!

649
01:07:38,412 --> 01:07:40,043
- Begin.
- Yes!

650
01:07:44,343 --> 01:07:45,596
I'm ready.

651
01:07:46,196 --> 01:07:50,175
Do not joke - our lads
are serious.

652
01:07:50,475 --> 01:07:53,833
Ermakov, strike that citizen!

653
01:07:56,133 --> 01:07:57,376
How hard?

654
01:07:58,276 --> 01:08:00,619
Pretend that he was your
class enemy.

655
01:08:00,919 --> 01:08:03,139
- Do it!
- Come on.

656
01:08:09,439 --> 01:08:11,124
Khromov: Please.

657
01:08:27,424 --> 01:08:29,414
Something like that.

658
01:08:29,714 --> 01:08:32,786
- Well done!
- Very good!

659
01:08:34,086 --> 01:08:37,538
Here you go. We take it to the service.

660
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:44,648
"Every man is endowed with a 
major reservoir of creativity,

661
01:08:44,948 --> 01:08:49,820
but most people sleep soundly.

662
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:54,699
To awaken the forces -
is our most important task. "

663
01:08:56,999 --> 01:08:59,298
Anatoly Harlampiev

664
01:09:06,217 --> 01:09:10,867
END
