00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,719
<i>"Serious sport has nothing</i>
<i>to do with fair play. "

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,593
<i>"It is bound up</i>
<i>with hatred, jealousy, -

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,352
<i>- disregard of rules and sadistic</i>
<i>pleasure in witnessing violence. "

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,599
<i>"In other words,</i>
<i>it is war minus the shooting."</i>

6
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,594
<i>George Orwell's quote from 1945</i>
<i>may apply elsewhere in the world, -

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,519
<i>- but not in Denmark.</i>

8
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,636
<i>We uphold the saying:</i>
<i>You win some, you lose some.</i>

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,112
<i>This Danish mantra sure applies</i>
<i>in the seventies -

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,438
<i>- where the Danish national team's</i>
<i>result vary, to put it mildly.</i>

11
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,036
<i>Finals come and go</i>
<i>without Danish participation.</i>

12
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,314
As a keeper,
I don't perform miracle saves.

13
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,829
I regard myself as a mediocre keeper.

14
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,150
Well done... oh!
We crashed and burned.

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,033
What a blunder by Erik Lykke.

16
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,717
<i>Homespun training exercises,</i>
<i>incoherent play -

17
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,631
<i>- and a serious lack of stability.</i>
<i>That sums up the Danish team.</i>

18
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,957
Get back in the goal, Per Poulsen.

19
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,591
<i>Economy is a major problem.</i>
<i>The Denmark manager, Kurt Nielsen, -

20
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,750
<i>- is only employed part-time and</i>
<i>so can't prepare for the matches.</i>

21
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,958
Got any new ideas for this match,
tactically and teamwise?

22
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,429
No. Tactically it's still
about scoring goals, -

23
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,350
- so that's our aim.
As for new ideas...

24
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,314
Kurt owns a small African-style bar.

25
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,196
Kurt used to manage
the Gambian national team.

26
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,712
You hadn't reckoned on
losing two games in two days.

27
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,074
Well, it was only 0-1, so...

28
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,319
If we want to get ahead,
we need more money.

29
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,114
Where from is not up to me.

30
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,394
<i>The money does arrive. In 1978,</i>
<i>the Danish brewery Carlsberg gives -

31
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,879
<i>- the Danish Football Association,</i>
<i>DBU, a million-kroner sponsorship -

32
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,596
<i>- on the condition that</i>
<i>professional standards are set -

33
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,191
<i>- and a professional manager</i>
<i>is hired.</i>

34
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,518
"For He's A Jolly Good Fellow" is
played in honour of Kurt Nielsen.

35
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,713
He's been criticized lately -

36
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,314
- but he has tried to produce
entertaining football -

37
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,593
- with the means available.

38
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,078
His successor is this man,
just 38 years old.

39
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,555
I got by as a German in Denmark
because of my background.

40
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,993
I was the national manager in Haiti
under the dictator Baby Doc -

41
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,590
- son of Papa Doc
who murdered 11,000 people.

42
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,236
He loved football and wanted
a German manager and got me.

43
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,513
"Alemano bruto", the tough German.

44
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,670
Piontek showed no mercy and
took our best keeper off the team -

45
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,671
- because Piontek wasn't
satisfied with his attitude.

46
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,997
Danes don't like the word
"discipline".

47
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:31,276
"Nobody bosses us around. We're no
good anyway." I had to change that.

48
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,756
I've met Idi Amin from Uganda.

49
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,670
He was a former boxer
and had a flat nose.

50
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:46,433
I met him in Saudi Arabia and he
said: "Good discipline, good coach."

51
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,112
I've met Ceausescu's son,
the manager of Steaua Bucharest.

52
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,793
Saddam Hussein's son
Uday Hussein. Yes, I've met a few.

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,439
<i>Carlsberg wants Denmark to make</i>
<i>the World Championships in Spain.</i>

54
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,235
Piontek vows
to get Denmark to the championships.

55
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,639
<i>But the fairy-tale soon</i>
<i>turns into a tragedy.</i>

56
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,631
A huge disappointment
in part due to very bad luck.

57
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,116
<i>The players don't go for</i>
<i>Piontek's discipline talk.</i>

58
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,118
We lost 2-1. Bad luck.

59
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,871
The gathered reporters agreed -

60
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,517
- the team doesn't have the mental
strength to win. Danes just don't.

61
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,156
I think we deserved a point.

62
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,388
The only taste of Spain
for Denmark this time -

63
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,989
- is "adíos España".

64
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,590
Allegedly, Mr. Piontek doesn't
have the necessary authority.

65
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,394
Please sit down.

66
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:01,836
<i>Piontek's had enough when the team</i>
<i>toasts their defeat in champagne.</i>

67
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:10,470
I'd expected some kind of reflection
on their part. "Why can't we win?"

68
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,276
But there was nothing of that.
They still felt like amateurs.

69
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,074
<i>So Piontek moves the training camp -

70
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,478
<i>- to the dreary, barbed-wire fenced</i>
<i>concrete fort "Idrættens Hus".</i>

71
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,958
That annoyed them.
They were used to five-star hotels -

72
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:33,599
- and now had to make do
without TV and phone in the rooms.

73
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,989
They didn't have coins for the
payphones and couldn't call home.

74
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,829
That didn't suit them at all.

75
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,556
But that was my way of telling them
to shape up -

76
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,276
- if they wanted to play
for the national side.

77
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,234
<i>Piontek puts the workhorses</i>
<i>up front.</i>

78
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,991
<i>Players not afraid of sacrificing</i>
<i>themselves or getting hurt.</i>

79
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,592
<i>Piontek gets a final chance:</i>

80
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,032
<i>Get Denmark to qualify</i>
<i>for the Euro 84 in France.</i>

81
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:06,157
Aren't you Sepp Piontek?
I thought so.

82
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,629
I agreed to stay on
and take a paycut.

83
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,958
<i>Denmark ends up in the same</i>
<i>qualifying group as England.</i>

84
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,869
<i>Denmark is losing the first game</i>
<i>between the two -

85
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,629
<i>- until a tiny dribbler</i>
<i>shows them how it's done.</i>

86
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,389
Jesper Olsen.
The last chance of the game?

87
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,875
No, no, no! Only a brilliant move
like that can dupe Peter Shilton.

88
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,599
I'm stunned, but I have to present
our new star player: Jesper Olsen.

89
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,636
Here he outwits four defenders
and Shilton. Presenting Jesper Olsen.

90
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,111
Jesper Olsen is a cheeky dribbler.

91
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,796
Allan Simonsen!

92
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,315
Allan snores something awful.

93
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:42,959
But I'm a heavy sleeper so I took
him, much to the others' relief.

94
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,273
Brilliant, Preben Elkjær!

95
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,158
Come on... Yes, Preben Elkjær!

96
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,716
Elkjær... terrific!

97
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,312
What kind of life would you like
instead of football?

98
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,750
I want nothing else.

99
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,631
Preben Elkjær again! Fantastic!

100
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,470
What a preposterous angle
to shoot from.

101
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,115
Preben Elkjær and
Michael Laudrup... And he scores!

102
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,392
Michael Laudrup!

103
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,758
I think he's a football genius.

104
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,317
Laudrup is the quintessence
of football magic.

105
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,715
I'll always be a fan of Laudrup.

106
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,832
I could say so much about Laudrup...

107
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,309
He drags the Russians towards him.
Michael Laudrup!

108
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,957
Allan Simonsen... And Laudrup.

109
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,436
Yes! Michael Laudrup!

110
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,599
<i>In the second game against England,</i>
<i>the Danes fly to London -

111
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,148
<i>- where they have to win in order</i>
<i>to qualify for the championships.</i>

112
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,079
Training is soon underway.

113
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:39,630
It's the first time for most of them
in the world's most famous arena.

114
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,714
What's up, Preben?
Did you hurt your foot?

115
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,033
- Did you twist your ankle?
- Yes.

116
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,114
<i>Our worst fears are confirmed:</i>
<i>Elkjær can't make the starting 11.</i>

117
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,229
The first 20 minutes
will be decisive for this match.

118
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,911
We must keep the English at bay.

119
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,389
The plan is
to take the game to them -

120
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,357
- and keep them out of
our penalty area.

121
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,350
This is going to tax the forwards.

122
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,836
No. 7, Ray Wilkins...

123
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:12,317
They need to take control now. Michael
Laudrup is clear of the defenders.

124
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,149
Michael Laudrup... Oh no!

125
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:23,357
Well, it's almost too much to ask
after a mere 50 seconds.

126
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,516
We entered the pitch bluffing.

127
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,236
They knew we were good
but we made us out to be even better.

128
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,877
"We've got the ball.
Come and take it."

129
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,679
Allan Simonsen... Penalty!

130
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,115
Phil Neal handled the ball.
Danish penalty after 36 minutes.

131
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,508
My thoughts were racing.

132
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:01,717
I remember thinking what an impact
this could have on Danish football.

133
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,078
Yes! Denmark leads 1-0.

134
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:21,592
A forward on for a midfielder. We're
already a minute into injury time.

135
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:36,159
Terrific save. Ole Kjær saves
the game for us in the dying seconds.

136
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,751
Denmark is
an international sensation!

137
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,873
That was the international
breakthrough for Danish football.

138
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:52,111
Both because of the result and
the intelligent way we achieved it.

139
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,235
<i>The impossible has happened: We're</i>
<i>in the European Championships.</i>

140
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:04,437
This is what I've tried
to teach them. "We can win".

141
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,158
I believe in God. The Bible says
that faith moves mountains.

142
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,672
I couldn't do it
without help from above.

143
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,078
My generation
grew up during the war.

144
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,477
We experienced its final stages.

145
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,834
We've carried a guilt complex
around with us ever since.

146
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,079
Our fathers were the villains.

147
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:43,359
We're in the finals in France
with the eight best teams in Europe.

148
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,315
Denmark.

149
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,592
Would a draw in the first match
be satisfactory?

150
00:15:51,800 --> 00:16:00,310
If we could get the French to make
it a draw, I'd settle for that.

151
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:22,151
An opening game in the finals
is a dream that's finally come true.

152
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,558
Morten Olsen plays
his 63rd international match.

153
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,230
Allan Simonsen plays
his 48th match.

154
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:36,834
Young Michael Laudrup plays
his 14th match.

155
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,831
Platini... Berggreen is
on Platini like a shadow.

156
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,270
<i>Michel Platini,</i>
<i>the football idol.</i>

157
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,919
- Berggreen fouls Platini.
- He's right behind Platini.

158
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,790
Foul.
Platini gets his revenge here.

159
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,632
Sepp and I have discussed
Platini's style -

160
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,197
- and Sepp put me on him
because I know him best.

161
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,316
Platini is at his most dangerous
when he sneaks up from deep positions.

162
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,355
I've never tried to mark a man,
but I think I did quite well.

163
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,269
Berggreen... Arnesen and Elkjær.

164
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,636
Okay, okay.

165
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,830
The under-21 national team manager
Richard Møller Nielsen.

166
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,317
Allan Simonsen.

167
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,516
He's in a bad way.
The ball's been kicked into touch.

168
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,036
Is this the end for Allan Simonsen?
He's a hard player to do without.

169
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,397
The crowd applauds him.

170
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:10,280
The French spectators know him
and his reputation very well.

171
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,153
European Player of the Year in 1977 -

172
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,276
- like the French favourite Platini
last year.

173
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,749
Platini.

174
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,350
Don't give him too much space.

175
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,438
Platini heads it.

176
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,710
This is one of those instances
when Platini is over the ball.

177
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,432
Ole Qvist!
Platini heads it again.

178
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,154
Laudrup down the left.

179
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,273
Elkjær in the middle.

180
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,553
He shoots... Oh!

181
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,718
Laudrup again...

182
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,952
Oh! It was Berggreen.

183
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,719
It didn't look like a penalty.

184
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,510
He's not offside. Giresse.

185
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,639
The crowd's been entertained during
this second half, that's for sure.

186
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:58,710
That must get Amoros sent off.
He headbutted Jesper Olsen.

187
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:06,110
It's insane for such a terrific game
to end like that.

188
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,314
Sure, Jesper Olsen commits a foul,
right there...

189
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,512
But look now.

190
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,077
This must get him suspended. First,
he throws the ball at Jesper...

191
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,239
This is insane.

192
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,956
Hopefully, he will be suspended
from the rest of the tournament.

193
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:34,029
He doesn't deserve to play.
Goodbye and good riddance.

194
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,991
The stars don't need a lot,
and they're lucky.

195
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,751
He'd hardly touched the ball
and then he got a lucky shot.

196
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,236
Platini scores.

197
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,356
What a blow for Ole Qvist,
only 12 minutes from time.

198
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:07,557
The Danes are all over the shop
and Platini gets his opportunity.

199
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,390
Søren Busk stumbles
and is hit by the ball.

200
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:19,438
I feel sorry for you, boys.
What a great, disciplined effort.

201
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,997
- You lost him just that once.
- He touched it a mere three times.

202
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,354
When he finally shoots, it's a
lousy shot that hits somebody's head.

203
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,714
And I got cheated out
of a penalty.

204
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,550
- It looks as if it's too late.
- I was about to kick when I fell.

205
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,072
- You don't stumble until later.
- No.

206
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,593
Which camera is on all three os us?

207
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,588
Is that it?

208
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:03,276
Four, three... two, one, zero.

209
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,757
I'm here with two
of the Danish key players.

210
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,830
Klaus Berggreen, if ever
there was a fixed task, this was it.

211
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,032
You had to mark the best player
in Europe.

212
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,710
It's also my most frustrating defeat.

213
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:29,429
Platini touches the ball three times.
His lousy shot on goal -

214
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,758
- takes a lucky deflection
off Busk's head and dupes Qvist.

215
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:41,150
The team was shocked, but it also
spurred them to think:

216
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:48,914
"We have to make do without him.
For his sake we have to do well."

217
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,033
We were in training
when they said:

218
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,550
"We want to do something
for Allan Simonsen."

219
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:02,710
"But we've already sent him
12 bottles of wine and flowers."

220
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:08,074
"We have to train now.
We're in Paris, and he is back home."

221
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,159
They wanted to sing for him on TV.

222
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:19,072
"But you can't sing. Frank Arnesen
is the only one who can sing."

223
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,310
They were willing to make
fools of themselves -

224
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,592
- to show Allan
he was in our thoughts.

225
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,872
<i>Allan</i>
<i>you're our friend</i>

226
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,318
<i>we think of you</i>
<i>again and again</i>

227
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,830
<i>this is a song for you</i>

228
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:02,597
<i>hope to see you in Paris</i>

229
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,598
That proved to me they were a team.

230
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:13,273
They worried about their friend
whose career, in reality, ended here.

231
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,078
<i>Without their superstar,</i>
<i>Allan Simonsen, the team shapes up.</i>

232
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,398
<i>The strong Yugoslavs</i>
<i>whom we've never defeated -

233
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,151
<i>- take a severe beating when we</i>
<i>show them how football is played.</i>

234
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,352
I'm overjoyed. 5-0!

235
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,599
<i>Denmark enjoys</i>
<i>the fine summer weather.</i>

236
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,156
- Here you go, kiddo.
- Thanks, Big Ole.

237
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,433
Puskás taught me something
before you were born.

238
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,872
He stepped on it and tipped it.

239
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:20,269
It looks as if you pull it back
when you tip it, to send it flying.

240
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,350
- No. I do it from the side.
- Of course.

241
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,393
That goes without saying.

242
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,118
- The hard part is getting under it.
- I don't think about it.

243
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,517
We're looking forward to the
final group game against Belgium -

244
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,712
- where several of our players
play for club sides.

245
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,712
Friends and club mates are involved.

246
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,358
Five or six Anderlecht players are up
against two others from Anderlecht.

247
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,350
They're up against club mates
from Lokeren, Gent and Seraing.

248
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,958
<i>We're in the unfamiliar situation -

249
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,436
<i>- that a draw</i>
<i>will get us into the semis.</i>

250
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,714
<i>Belgium, on the other hand,</i>
<i>have to defeat us.</i>

251
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,750
Jan Ceulemans fouls Elkjær.

252
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:46,271
Foul. And they're club mates.
Vandereycken shoves him.

253
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,597
With friends like that!

254
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:55,318
The Belgian players entered the pitch
hoping to intimidate us.

255
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:01,675
Why doesn't he book him?
That referee is going to be trouble.

256
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,638
Such intensity.

257
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:21,714
De Greef commits a foul.
Arnesen fouls no. 5, De Wolff.

258
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,588
Oh, no! He has to get a booking.

259
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,511
Morten Olsen shoves his club mate
to the ground.

260
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,998
What an ugly foul
against a club mate.

261
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,150
He knows Arnesen's been struggling
to recover from two knee operations.

262
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:55,356
Vandereycken who fouls Arnesen
is a great guy.

263
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:02,477
We all forgot we were club mates.
We played for our countries.

264
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:09,472
Now, my own reaction surprises me.
If I'd had a gun, I'd have shot him.

265
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,992
What a shame if it turns into
a show of brute force.

266
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,988
Both teams are
so much better than that.

267
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,512
Jens Jørn Bertelsen... and Elkjær!

268
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,109
The referee waves it off.

269
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:32,954
Jean-Marie Pfaff's tackle is
late enough to validate a penalty.

270
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:43,794
Ceulemans.
And the Belgians take the lead. 1-0.

271
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,996
Vercauteren...

272
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,672
What a fine shot
from Frank Vercauteren's left foot.

273
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,908
Belgium leads 2-0.
Look how he nets it.

274
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,193
Great goal.
All the worse for us.

275
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,517
Preben Elkjær.

276
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,196
Penalty!
Even though it was a bit of a dive.

277
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:25,353
Yes! Arnesen's third goal
in the tournament.

278
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,633
Kenneth Brylle here, the third
Anderlecht player in the team.

279
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,957
This is his ninth
international match.

280
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,676
Lerby... that was meant for Arnesen.

281
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:44,515
Vandenbergh is through on goal.
Well done, Ole Qvist!

282
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,272
Ole Qvist is hailed as
the tournament's best keeper so far.

283
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,399
Yes! Kenneth Brylle scores.

284
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:04,357
Terrific run by Arnesen
and a great header by Kenneth Brylle.

285
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:11,477
Perfect header. I bet Sepp Piontek
told him to get in and score.

286
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,879
2-2. If it stays like this,
we're in the semifinals.

287
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,837
Elkjær could pass to Laudrup
but he's offside now.

288
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,034
Elkjær keeps going...
Over him and yes!

289
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,635
Unbelievable!
That man is fantastic.

290
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:41,554
He goes past two defenders, the
world's best keeper approaches him...

291
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,356
Well done, Preben!

292
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:51,554
Let's see it again. He goes past two
defenders knowing Laudrup's offside.

293
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,995
The ball hits De Greef
but he just keeps going.

294
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:04,594
Behind De Greef, and look,
here comes Pfaff... Wham!

295
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:10,591
We're in the semifinals, people.
Preben Elkjær is world-class.

296
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:16,158
He is unbelievable.
He hurt his thigh, and so what?

297
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:22,758
And there's the whistle.
What a remarkable feat -

298
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,317
- performed by this team
of unconquerable optimists.

299
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,991
They were behind 0-2 against
one of the best teams in the world -

300
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,069
- but still came out on top.
Impressive.

301
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,039
Some things you can't deny
the Danes.

302
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:54,032
Like a good laugh now and then,
music on the way to the stadium.

303
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:05,191
<i>We're digging in our toes</i>
<i>we're Olsen's gang, we're winners</i>

304
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:11,475
<i>there's no one we can't beat</i>
<i>we've got our own secret plan</i>

305
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,669
<i>we're one two three</i>
<i>eleven men</i>

306
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:23,039
<i>you'll never beat us</i>
<i>we're the winners...</i>

307
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,356
People think football stars are rich.

308
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,997
How much did you make at 17
as a full-time pro in Amsterdam?

309
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,752
- The same as you.
- I made the same as Søren.

310
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,632
<i>We can't believe it's true.</i>

311
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:08,119
<i>We're up against a major player</i>
<i>in the semifinals.</i>

312
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:15,351
Yugoslavia, France and Belgium
were some of the best teams.

313
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,998
So we took Spain in our stride.

314
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:11,511
Terrific! After six minutes, Lerby
scores his first tournament goal.

315
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:16,350
Look at that. The ball hits
the crossbar, and here comes Lerby.

316
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,439
<i>In our first European Championships</i>
<i>ever we're one half from the final.</i>

317
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:27,034
The worst thing that could happen
is for Spain to score quickly.

318
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:34,669
He's offside...
Well done, Ole Qvist!

319
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,678
Well done, Ole Qvist!

320
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,668
Great save by Qvist.

321
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,749
Great shot,
and Ole Qvist did a great job.

322
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,516
Sarabia...

323
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,395
A great opportunity for Santillana.

324
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,116
Luck was on our side there.

325
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:17,319
Gordillo... and Maceda!
And Spain equalizes.

326
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,275
We've been under
a lot of pressure.

327
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,952
Pass the ball... Oh no, offside.
No, the referee hasn't called it.

328
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,879
Frank Arnesen...

329
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:36,234
He shoots... No!

330
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,750
Lerby makes the run.

331
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,873
Let's go.
Can he score again?

332
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,638
Keep going, Jesper Olsen.
Elkjær's there.

333
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,834
Let Laudrup dribble the ball.

334
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:02,230
He knows how to outwit Maceda.
Nice shot, Laudrup!

335
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,113
Preben Elkjær...

336
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,836
This must be it... No!

337
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,038
Look at Elkjær's shorts. Rather
indicative of the Spanish methods.

338
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,074
There goes the whistle.
Now awaits the final act -

339
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:26,833
- of the Spanish-Danish drama.
Each team selects five players.

340
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,590
Now it's man to man.

341
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:49,113
I can guarantee you
this is a war of nerves.

342
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,952
Alright! Easy as pie.

343
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,950
Arconada gambled. 1-0 to Denmark.

344
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,515
Ole almost got it. Almost.

345
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,518
Michael Laudrup steps forward.

346
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,589
He's played his best game today,
in my opinion.

347
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,509
His 17th international match.

348
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:43,278
His nerves got the better
of this 20-year-old.

349
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,873
The referee says Arconada
started too early. Spain protests.

350
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,676
He takes a step, and here comes
the ball. It's marginal.

351
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:59,830
Amazing that the referee saw it
but Arconada is booked.

352
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,151
Come on, Michael.

353
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,269
Yes!

354
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,039
This is almost unbearable.

355
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,593
Right into the roof of the net. 3-3.

356
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,713
Again into the roof of the net.
We lead 4-3.

357
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,829
And 4-4.

358
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,193
I wasn't nervous at all.

359
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,793
I'd taken six penalties for my club
that year and scored on all six -

360
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,037
- so I was sure I could do it.

361
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,195
Elkjær's wonderful shooting skills
failed him.

362
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,154
There's no excuse
for missing a penalty.

363
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:12,912
Someone has to kick and someone
has to miss, or we'd still be there.

364
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:18,069
I've taken two penalties for the team
and missed them both. Pure routine.

365
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,796
We took comfort in the fact that
never has our team played better.

366
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,154
We proved to the world there's more
to Denmark than bacon and beer.

367
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:44,478
The Danish identity rests
on the recognition -

368
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,355
- that Denmark is a small country.
We don't think we can hack it.

369
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,634
That's why we idolize mediocrity
and our pettiness -

370
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:58,197
- and somehow turn
our inferiority complex -

371
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,997
- into a megalomania
based on mediocrity and pettiness.

372
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,909
Let's all be proud -

373
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:13,399
- of being Danish!
Long live Denmark.

374
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:20,278
Everyone wants to be
on the winning team.

375
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,314
<i>Like the little</i>
<i>ugly duckling</i>

376
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,308
<i>we go red and white</i>
<i>at once</i>

377
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,274
<i>soaring like the white swans</i>

378
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,950
<i>on the fields around the world</i>

379
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,833
Underwear for him and her.

380
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:48,593
Our enthusiastic supporters
are a tremendous help.

381
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:55,148
<i>Like the hero of the fable</i>
<i>we clap our hats and greet you</i>

382
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,152
<i>we are red</i>

383
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,152
<i>we are white</i>

384
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:09,193
<i>united we stand</i>

385
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,153
<i>side by side</i>

386
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,113
For years Denmark's main export
has been porn and cheese.

387
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,552
But since the arrival of the
German manager Sepp Piontek -

388
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,116
- football is Denmark's main brand.

389
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,788
It was the orgasm of my life.

390
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,276
Until I became Minister of Culture
sport reminded me of porn.

391
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,519
It's fun to take part
but boring to watch.

392
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,032
One day someone wrote a question
on a wall in Copenhagen.

393
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:58,997
"What if Jesus comes back?"
The next day someone wrote:

394
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,671
"We'll just move Elkjær out wide."

395
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,508
Denmark? No. 5.

396
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:36,672
The Danish team brought their
own pillows and duvets to Mexico.

397
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,112
- Have you had difficulty sleeping?
- It's a big problem.

398
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,872
The Danes pull ahead.
They're agile and in great shape.

399
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,548
Goal!
What is their secret?

400
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,072
Their secret is
the fresh Danish meat.

401
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,552
A little more of that
and we'll do fine in Mexico.

402
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,596
The next group holds West Germany
and Scotland, a tough group.

403
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,519
<i>Ahead lies the ultimate challenge.</i>

404
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,234
Denmark gets the pleasure.

405
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,557
<i>The World Cup in Mexico.</i>

406
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,515
Up at 8, breakfast at 8:30,
and altitude training at 9:30.

407
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:57,759
Normal training at 10
and lunch at 1 pm.

408
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,829
From 2-4 pm, rest and massage,
altitude training at 4:30 -

409
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,397
- and then normal training
until dinner at 7:30 pm.

410
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:12,116
From 8:30-11:30 rest and theory
and then it's bedtime.

411
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:17,155
Will you be able to play your
normal physically demanding game?

412
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,191
Absolutely not.

413
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:27,598
This training camp is tough.
Your body gets no rest at all.

414
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:32,794
At home you can grab a beer -

415
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,472
- but I think I've had two here.
And I miss my girlfriend.

416
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,638
We train, eat and sleep.

417
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,038
There's no time to sunbathe
much to the dismay of some.

418
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,835
It's more important to become
world champions than tanned.

419
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:57,594
If this is a pro's life, it's pretty
drab. I'd rather stay at home.

420
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,709
Mexico is very different
from Denmark.

421
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:13,395
Some of the players got ill
and lost several pounds.

422
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:18,674
The world isn't all cakes and ale
and Danes can be somewhat naive.

423
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,995
It's tough to see because
no one is that bad off back home.

424
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,272
No one starves.

425
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,109
We've met a lot of single moms
begging on the streets.

426
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:38,519
- Seen much of Mexico?
- We've spent an hour in Querétaro.

427
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,996
Otherwise we've been
at our heavily guarded hotel.

428
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:47,149
- You don't get to see anything?
- No, we're here to play football.

429
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:52,115
Querétaro, the Danes' host town,
feels the Danes' indifference.

430
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,108
Our German opponents cultivate
the Mexican spectators -

431
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:01,519
- but the Danes haven't been in
contact with the Mexican committee.

432
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:25,595
If the Scots beat you and you're out,
that would be a bloody shame.

433
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,794
Elkjær... He goes past...

434
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:37,030
<i>Having defeated Scotland the</i>
<i>team's second match is a challenge.</i>

435
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:42,030
They're good on the ball
and technically skilled...

436
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,791
They're the South American
champions, doesn't that say it all?

437
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,313
<i>They're two times world champions</i>
<i>and South American champions.</i>

438
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:57,389
<i>They have one of South America's</i>
<i>best players: Enzo Francescoli.</i>

439
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,955
Who is the stronger team?

440
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,631
In my opinion, Uruguay is
the strongest team in the group.

441
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,956
Denmark kicks off the game.

442
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,959
A draw would be
a wonderful result for Denmark.

443
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,311
Francescoli...

444
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,318
The referee calls a penalty!

445
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,193
Francescoli... He scores!

446
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,556
Good tackle.

447
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,912
<i>The Danes succeed in marking</i>
<i>Francescoli -

448
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:46,238
<i>- and the game takes</i>
<i>an unexpected turn.</i>

449
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,638
Great dribble, and Elkjær... Yes!

450
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:56,597
Preben Elkjær!
Excellent dribble by Laudrup.

451
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,759
And Lerby, yes!

452
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:07,354
Lerby followed Elkjær
who delivered a perfect cross.

453
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:12,998
Busk... Lerby passes to Laudrup.

454
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,478
Laudrup shoots... No, he waits.

455
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,549
Michael Laudrup! Brilliant!

456
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,354
Michael Laudrup!

457
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:36,429
That's one of the best goals
in this entire tournament.

458
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,555
He plays like an old pro.

459
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,834
Laudrup is through on goal and scores.

460
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,836
Frank Arnesen is there. Elkjær,
Laudrup and Berggreen pull up.

461
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:24,192
Laudrup, Berggreen... Mølby!
Shoot, Mølby!

462
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,520
The Mexican spectators
cheer "olé" each time.

463
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,473
Arnesen...

464
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,389
Laudrup... he shoots.

465
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:45,436
Here comes Elkjær, yes!
He outruns a devastated keeper!

466
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:50,316
<i>The great Swedish author</i>
<i>P.O. Enquist comments on the game.</i>

467
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:56,470
<i>"They should dedicate a green field</i>
<i>in heaven to Laudrup and Elkjær."</i>

468
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:00,878
<i>"We, the spectators, will come</i>
<i>to this heaven and cheer them -

469
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,550
<i>- after this divine evening."</i>

470
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,997
Elkjær again...
This time he passes to Jesper.

471
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,789
Yes, Jesper Olsen!

472
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:25,475
Let's end this humiliation
of Uruguay.

473
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:30,959
<i>In trepidation we await the match</i>
<i>against our old occupier, Germany, -

474
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,038
<i>- whom we haven't defeated</i>
<i>in 50 years.</i>

475
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,516
<i>The match presents</i>
<i>an unfortunate paradox -

476
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,110
<i>- since both teams are</i>
<i>best off losing -

477
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:45,552
<i>- as the winner is up against the</i>
<i>hardest team in the last sixteen:</i>

478
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,309
<i>Our nemesis from 84, Spain.</i>

479
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:55,277
My football philosophy is:
You play to win, not to lose.

480
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:00,110
Is this a match for Sepp Piontek
against Frans Beckenbauer?

481
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,108
I suppose so. Sepp really
wants to beat the Germans.

482
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:09,519
I asked him if he'd told the team
to lose against Denmark. "Oh, no."

483
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:14,840
He probably mocked Sepp for taking
on the useless Danes back in the day.

484
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,158
Now he's created a world-class team,
and he wants to show the Germans.

485
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,877
The Germans know both teams
have qualified.

486
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:28,551
Even if it's a draw,
Denmark can win the group.

487
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,149
Let's hope for a peaceful game.

488
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:35,353
Morten Olsen wants to speed things
up and runs the length of the pitch -

489
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,949
- and is tackled in the penalty area.

490
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,312
Fantastic run by Morten Olsen.
Penalty for the Danes.

491
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:49,232
We'd agreed to have Jesper shoot
and I shouted to him not to score -

492
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,512
- because we didn't need to win.
"Sure."

493
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:57,111
Jesper Olsen versus Schumacher.
He nets it!

494
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,232
He scores. What to do?

495
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,989
I took out Preben Elkjær,
much to his dismay, and said:

496
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:10,673
"1-0 is sufficient.
Let John Eriksen make his debut."

497
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,237
Here comes John Eriksen,
and he puts Denmark ahead 2-0!

498
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,910
John Eriksen scores to 2-0.
What to do?

499
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:23,272
For three matches,
Denmark has maximum points: 6!

500
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:30,669
It's easy to see when you're annoyed.
Your body language gives you away.

501
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,593
Denmark is my favourite.

502
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,952
Banners in Querétaro say Spain is
the Danish Dynamite's next victim.

503
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:53,553
The Danish attacking style is
a wonderful gift to the spectators, -

504
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,117
- a unique quality
in this day and age.

505
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,869
The Danes are popular in Mexico.

506
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:06,870
Girls chase them
and their autographs everywhere.

507
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:11,278
At least ten times a day this song
is played on the radio in Querétaro.

508
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:16,156
"Gunnar Nununu" as the Spanish DJ's
call him, with a Danish football hit.

509
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:21,388
The Mexican papers all cheer
and praise the Danish team.

510
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:25,673
<i>We're one of 16 teams left.</i>
<i>This is all or nothing.</i>

511
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:29,714
It's incredible to be Danish
in Mexico these days.

512
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,596
Everyone comes up to you and says
Denmark will make the final.

513
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,110
Berggreen... and Laudrup!

514
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,154
Berggreen, Elkjær...

515
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,430
Good shot, Elkjær!

516
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,358
Berggreen makes the run...
Penalty!

517
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:57,473
Berggreen reaches the area,
and the tackle was too late.

518
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,877
Referee Keizer calls a penalty.

519
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:07,872
It's essential that he scores.
And he does!

520
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:19,550
Denmark leads 1-0.
What a relief.

521
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:27,110
Three minutes left of the first half,
Denmark leads 1-0.

522
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:37,197
He had no business there.
I don't know what he was doing there.

523
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,791
I could have done a hundred
other things... and should have.

524
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,594
A left-winger has no business there.

525
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,634
Whoops, Jesper Nielsen kicks it
too near the goal.

526
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,071
Butragueño scores.

527
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:57,354
Stupidity is punished.
It all fell apart after that.

528
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,996
They thought: "So we'll get a holiday.
We've done well."

529
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:06,832
I said: "Some of you only get
to take part in one World Cup."

530
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:20,592
Sepp has to grab hold of us and tell
us how important this match is.

531
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:28,678
But mentally
we were already back home.

532
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,509
We were beginning to get homesick.

533
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:16,313
He'd made up his mind to say yes,
but then he said no.

534
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:22,197
How do you feel about
Sepp Piontek's resignation?

535
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,996
Sepp Piontek quits inconveniently
June 1st after 10½ years in Denmark.

536
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,239
Three months before
the European qualifying rounds.

537
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:37,390
I've just got the telegram.
I refuse to believe it's as of now.

538
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,113
It's tragic.

539
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:43,598
Thursday night reporters called Sepp
about his financial situation.

540
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,759
I won't stand for it. I've worked
in Denmark for 10½ years.

541
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,269
I've done my best and paid my dues.

542
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,916
We're back to square one.

543
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,311
- Let's have a picture.
- No way!

544
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,035
Don't you know the Danes
well enough to bear with them?

545
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:08,715
Why should I stand for it?
They're ridiculing my family, too.

546
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:14,870
Piontek looks forward to escaping
the Danish "tall poppy syndrome".

547
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:19,596
It's affected of him to turn
an article, which he hasn't denied, -

548
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:26,717
- into a reason
for deserting Danish football.

549
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:30,515
It looks like a lame excuse.

550
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,315
The Turks made me a terrific offer -

551
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:40,197
- and I could make more money
due to the lenient Turkish tax laws.

552
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,473
Suddenly the papers write
I have a postbox in Liechtenstein.

553
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:49,549
If they hadn't written that,
I'd have extended my contract.

554
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:55,198
Germans do not like the word
"traitor" because of WW2.

555
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:01,589
If I go from Kolding to Tønder,
I can see up to 10 km ahead.

556
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:06,635
The roads are well-developed,
so why do I have to drive 80 km/h?

557
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:11,709
But here you have to drive 80,
because people say so. Envy.

558
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:17,233
DBU now faces the problem
of finding a manager in record time.

559
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:22,992
I think Richard Møller
is the obvious choice.

560
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,589
You've suggested Richard Møller.

561
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:30,231
Richard Møller Nielsen or "Ricardo"
lives of and for football.

562
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:34,638
In his basement he keeps an index
of all the European top players.

563
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:40,233
I definitely feel qualified.
I could do a good job.

564
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,677
Everyone's been guessing
and quarrelling. Finally we know:

565
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,872
Richard Møller Nielsen
is not the new manager.

566
01:00:54,080 --> 01:01:00,838
The board of DBU has decided -

567
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,396
- to hire a manager from abroad.

568
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:09,469
- Germans have served us well.
- They chose a foreigner.

569
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:15,038
There's nothing wrong with Richard,
but he lacks the international edge.

570
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:22,191
On a glorious sunny day, Denmark's
new manager arrived from Düsseldorf.

571
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,439
- Are Germans the only choice for us?
- It looks like it.

572
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:31,236
He doesn't know he got the job.

573
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:37,549
How long have you known
you were the new Denmark manager?

574
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,639
We've been negotiating
for three weeks -

575
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:47,358
- but nothing's been settled yet.
I'm under contract until 1991.

576
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:51,917
It's not been settled yet,
and that's why I'm here.

577
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,396
What problems remain?

578
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:00,276
DBU had already called a conference
to introduce the new manager.

579
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:06,396
So there he sat, rather lost, caught
up in a whirlwind of questions.

580
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:11,196
Frits just introduced me as the
new Denmark manager. I'm not, yet.

581
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,431
Let me answer that.

582
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:31,318
Everything has been done
by the book.

583
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:36,469
He doesn't seem convinced
that he's the new manager.

584
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:41,959
That's another surprise, to present
a manager who's not sure he is.

585
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:47,439
The President of Bayer Uerdingen
knew nothing about the negotiations.

586
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,758
He doesn't understand
DBU's methods.

587
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:55,191
Bayer Uerdingen's Danish player,
Jan Bartram, says -

588
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,870
- Uerdingen can claim
four million kroner in damages.

589
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:04,757
Don't you think you have to pay
damages for hiring Horst Wohlers?

590
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:14,312
The Brian Laudrup case was
a hard one to solve, but we did it.

591
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:18,991
I'm sure we'll solve this problem,
too.

592
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:25,275
You think it won't cost you a thing
to snatch him?

593
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:32,079
Let's see the problem presented,
before we discuss the solution.

594
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,955
The problem is right there.

595
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:40,995
I've informed Richard Møller
about our decision.

596
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,910
- How did he take it?
- Fine. Richard is good chap.

597
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:54,080
A stout Funen beech won't lose
a single leaf -

598
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:57,636
- just because
a couple of pigs rub against it.

599
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:01,515
The Funen beech is still standing.
Welcome.

600
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:06,077
Various board members have made
some fierce statements lately.

601
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:11,559
Hans Bjerg Petersen said
his granny could match your results.

602
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:18,279
I won't comment on that as I don't
know his granny's qualifications.

603
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:23,600
Richard Møller Nielsen has stated
he won't work for DBU anymore.

604
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:28,271
So both Richard and Horst Wohlers
are out of the picture.

605
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:33,156
Doesn't this resemble a circus show
with DBU playing the clown?

606
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,591
You could say that.

607
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:43,433
- But you don't have a manager.
- No, lots of people want that job.

608
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:49,112
<i>Still, things get panicky and DBU</i>
<i>have to grovel before the man -

609
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:52,039
<i>- they'd turned their backs on.</i>

610
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:56,916
- Are you bitter?
- No, bitter is something you drink.

611
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:04,592
It went according to plan
for my parents.

612
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:11,433
They had a boy first,
and then a girl, so all was well.

613
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:15,679
But five years later
I made my entrance as a fill-in.

614
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:19,998
I've been a manager for 27 years
and drawn up all my own contracts.

615
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:24,273
- Including the one today?
- More or less, yes.

616
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,199
- Did your lawyer see it?
- No.

617
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:31,598
I've never had anything against
being a fill-in.

618
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:36,555
Don't you fear having to fight
your way out of Piontek's shadow?

619
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:43,632
No, it's a bit like following
a top comedian on stage.

620
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:48,231
I'm not a carbon copy.
I have my own ideas.

621
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:54,276
I know people make fun
of the way I talk.

622
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:58,519
I try hard to talk standard Danish.

623
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:03,669
Some think you've copied Piontek's
accent, but you're from Funen.

624
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,394
That's how we speak on Funen.

625
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:11,797
My, my.

626
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:19,793
<i>Richard follows in a long line</i>
<i>of incomprehensible managers.</i>

627
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,194
MANAGER 1

628
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:25,154
...on p-paper,
KB champions should become.

629
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:30,275
But history shows us they're
much stronger at home.

630
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,595
MANAGER 2

631
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,758
I think we're too...

632
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,670
I hope... we've paid attention
to the private affairs -

633
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:43,236
- and best interests of Denmark.

634
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,555
MANAGER 3

635
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:51,233
Five points would be
a good starting point...

636
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,509
MANAGER 4

637
01:06:52,720 --> 01:07:00,035
Being assistant manager is a little
like kissing your own sister.

638
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:03,949
<i>Richard revives old ballgames</i>
<i>like "Piggy" and "Ib".</i>

639
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,470
<i>In "Piggy" you have to keep the ball</i>
<i>in the air.</i>

640
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,911
<i>Who ever drops the ball,</i>
<i>gets a P, or an I -

641
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:14,999
<i>- if they're playing the short</i>
<i>version of the game "Ib".</i>

642
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,954
<i>Who ever gets the least letters</i>
<i>wins a soft drink.</i>

643
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:24,359
- How do you like "Piggy" and "Ib"?
- Don't make me laugh.

644
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:33,154
It was quite funny.

645
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:39,117
What the hell...
It's one of the new things.

646
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:44,314
The question is
whether we learn anything.

647
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:49,036
<i>Richard's first challenge is to</i>
<i>qualify for the Euro 92 in Sweden.</i>

648
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:55,429
They've pulled one back!
The Danes didn't even intervene.

649
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,517
Get a move on!

650
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:04,118
They're still fast asleep,
Henrik Larsen and Kent Nielsen.

651
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:10,031
Berti alone with Marc Rieper.
Morten Bruun doesn't clear it.

652
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,317
And Schmeichel... No!

653
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,998
Goal to The Faroe Islands!

654
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:27,559
After the fat years come the lean.

655
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:32,515
- Do you see any development?
- Not really.

656
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:39,478
If Richard is to have a chance,
he needs a well-respected assistant.

657
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:44,071
Søren Lerby is an obvious choice.

658
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:49,877
The stork who carried Frank Arnesen
up here flew next to a parrot.

659
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:55,234
Frank talks a lot
and it's not all pearls.

660
01:08:55,440 --> 01:09:02,357
Our national team has deteriorated.
We'll never win anything.

661
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:09,272
The Danish strategy shocks me.
It's extremely unprofessional.

662
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:13,439
They should substitute more,
some players don't give their all...

663
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:16,074
- Who?
- Brian Laudrup.

664
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:20,068
Look how he stops and even
lets the ball pass through his legs.

665
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:24,512
Here he joins forces with his brother
but brothers don't solve everything.

666
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:28,235
I didn't know where to place myself.

667
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:34,993
- It wasn't Michael's day yesterday.
- No, he leaves it up to his mates.

668
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,476
Michael Laudrup leaves the field.

669
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:44,471
- You took both brothers out.
- They looked tired.

670
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:49,800
- Can't you play on your own terms?
- No, isn't that strange?

671
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:56,473
- I always let the manager decide.
- But shouldn't you be in agreement?

672
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:01,356
I don't know.

673
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:05,519
Michael wants you to use Jan Mølby.
Brian wants to talk tactics.

674
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:10,032
Do you mind players commenting
on your dispositions?

675
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:13,710
I'm not going to go into that here.

676
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:19,074
He wants other types of players. I'm
off the team as long as he's manager.

677
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:24,798
It's as if my generation isn't
allowed to win anything on that team.

678
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:33,829
Flemming looks very angry
and doesn't even glance at Richard.

679
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:37,749
- I can't explain that substitution.
- Think I can?

680
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:44,274
If that's the way we have to play,
I don't want to be in the team.

681
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,711
He's isolated now, and that's tough.

682
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:54,951
They hired him even though we all
know not even DBU wanted him.

683
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,798
He's outlawed.

684
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,073
Are you a sissy
who's afraid of being creative?

685
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:07,037
I'm not going to let myself
be affected by criticism like that.

686
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:13,076
It's not very intelligent, but then
we're all limited by our abilities.

687
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:19,469
Manager Richard is under fire.
Got any advice for him?

688
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:23,878
No, I don't think he'll listen.

689
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,709
- Was it better in Piontek's day?
- Goodness, yes.

690
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:33,278
- Are you playing against Iceland?
- No. None of us are.

691
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:38,952
You never sing along when
the camera pans across the team.

692
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:45,793
- I don't always remember the lyrics.
- Don't you know the national anthem?

693
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,797
Nope.

694
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:01,559
To anyone who'll listen:

695
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:08,711
"And as ye would that men should do
to you, do ye also to them likewise."

696
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:16,151
<i>The defeat in the qualifier against</i>
<i>Yugoslavia has grave consequences.</i>

697
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:23,119
A bunch of lackadaisical players
let themselves be humiliated.

698
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:27,313
Are you going to quit? You were
criticized after Northern Ireland.

699
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,318
Now we've lost 0-2.

700
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:36,311
We need a new manager!
A new manager!

701
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:45,551
Michael Laudrup is through
with the national team.

702
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:51,715
You've left the team.
In your opinion, -

703
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:58,109
- what needs to be done in order
for the team to pull through?

704
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,670
I honestly think all hope's lost.

705
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,954
Michael isn't able to roll up
his sleeves and get back in the game.

706
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:11,755
He's gotten by
on his incredible talent.

707
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:18,638
I don't have the energy to be
a core player on two teams -

708
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:24,437
- and to keep fulfilling
everyone's mad expectations.

709
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:29,270
I had to choose,
and Barcelona played great football.

710
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:35,032
He'd lost the urge
and that was in part Ricardo's fault.

711
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:41,952
They'd gather around the dinner table
and none of the players said a word.

712
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:46,915
He thought that silence was awful.

713
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:59,031
Brian Laudrup leaves the team due to
his dissatisfaction with the manager.

714
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:03,358
I've said I don't want
to be in the team -

715
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:08,793
- unless they hire a new manager.

716
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:16,429
If DBU is to create a special set
of rules for the Laudrup family, -

717
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:21,077
- because that is the issue,
I'm sure it'll anger many people.

718
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:25,114
Football players should keep
their mouths shut -

719
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:30,075
- because they're not smart. They
should concentrate on the game.

720
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:38,670
You've all had it
with Richard Møller Nielsen -

721
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:46,036
- and the entire Danish team
walks out on him.

722
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:50,631
The team walks out collectively
except for most of the team.

723
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:55,868
"The Laudrup Sisters" get blamed
for putting on airs.

724
01:14:56,080 --> 01:15:01,313
People were sitting in their rooms
and said: "We have to do something."

725
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:06,913
So Michael and I stepped forward
and said so -

726
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:11,193
- only the rest forgot
to follow suit.

727
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:18,033
- Is the media's view unintelligent?
- No.

728
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:26,750
I've told you and your colleague that
I have no further comments for you.

729
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:31,476
When you stoop to that level
and write that kind of trash, -

730
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:35,036
- I just feel sorry for you.

731
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:39,119
I don't think you did it
out of malice -

732
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:43,950
- just as I don't think a woman
prostitutes herself out of desire.

733
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:50,269
They do it out of necessity,
and so do you.

734
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:54,234
I believe and trust in God.

735
01:15:55,280 --> 01:16:01,276
<i>Yugoslavia wins the qualifying</i>
<i>group for Euro 92.</i>

736
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:08,272
<i>Denmark, on the other hand,</i>
<i>goes into football obscurity.</i>

737
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:02,998
It's just been decided to let Denmark
fill in for Yugoslavia in Euro 92.

738
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:09,594
FIFA has excluded Yugoslavia
from all international activities.

739
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:15,796
The good Lord gave me two eyes.
That day one cried, and one smiled.

740
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:22,919
I welcome the sanctions -

741
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:29,468
- applied
by the Security Council.

742
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:51,473
If Danish soldiers were on a killing
spree south of the border -

743
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:57,630
- I'd be ashamed to go to Sweden,
be it as a player or a manager.

744
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:06,799
They could have treated us like
gentlemen and spared us the trip.

745
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,755
When we, as an EC member,
recognize Slovenia and Croatia -

746
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:19,469
- we assist in dissolving Yugoslavia.
DBU shouldn't go to Sweden.

747
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:25,437
We didn't qualify, and the money
DBU stands to win, is blood money.

748
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:32,716
Some people think we're criminals
if we participate.

749
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:38,358
The press have been on our backs,
and suddenly we get the chance.

750
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:42,792
They make us out to be criminals.

751
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,309
My thoughts went to the Yugoslavs.

752
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:50,036
After 1 ½ years of voluntary absence
Brian Laudrup is back in the team.

753
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:53,550
The day after the criminals
gathered in training camp.

754
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:59,073
Most of us were gearing up
for barbecue parties and red wine -

755
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:03,398
- when suddenly you're off
to the championships.

756
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,912
You think: "Football? Oh, no!"

757
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:15,993
Everyone else went to the beach,
but I went jogging... for ice cream.

758
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:19,431
Dad's going to Euro 92.

759
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:24,634
The players strolled
the 500 metres to the field.

760
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:37,995
- I wasn't overjoyed at the news.
- We're all chubby holiday boys.

761
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,954
They came to camp out of shape.
What did the manager expect?

762
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:44,993
They were worse than expected.

763
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:52,990
<i>A team of second-rate players</i>
<i>and weirdos -

764
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:57,193
<i>- crosses the Sound to take part</i>
<i>in the European Championships.</i>

765
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:02,349
Today we publish "the people's team".
Think you're on it?

766
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,790
No way!

767
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,037
There are no stars. Only waterboys.

768
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,879
No one gets any special attention.

769
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:16,029
<i>Yes, some players do get</i>
<i>special attention.</i>

770
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:28,071
Laudrup... he scores!
Brian Laudrup.

771
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:42,069
It's been hard to live up to my
talented father and talented brother.

772
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:45,113
People expect me to be even better.

773
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:48,869
Brilliant dribble and goal
by Brian Laudrup.

774
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:56,555
It's like seeing his brother Michael
or even his father Finn Laudrup.

775
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:30,430
He'll be ready on Sunday.

776
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,670
Steven and Povlsen!

777
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,713
Flemming Povlsen... beautiful!

778
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:09,276
Flemming Povlsen sees
the keeper is off his line -

779
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:13,712
- and volleys the rebound
into the net.

780
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:20,758
<i>The finals start. Denmark does</i>
<i>OKand draws with England.</i>

781
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:27,308
<i>But after the defeat against Sweden,</i>
<i>the team seems to be finished.</i>

782
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,350
Good morning.

783
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:38,351
Yesterday, a majority of voters
voted against the European Union.

784
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,199
<i>Before Denmark's match</i>
<i>against France -

785
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:45,154
<i>- their president hopes Denmark will</i>
<i>leave the tournament unvictorious.</i>

786
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:49,831
It would symbolize their no to the EU
and encourage the French opponents.

787
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:58,755
Reasonably and physiologically
and all that, it can't be done.

788
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:06,389
"Look, I think we've got the tools
to clip France's wings and win, -

789
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:13,551
- and then we still have a chance
of getting into the semifinals."

790
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:19,551
Denmark hasn't scored yet. Who's
going to mark Jean-Pierre Papin?

791
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:30,354
How is an unfit Danish team
going to mark Papin? No one can.

792
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:34,314
Elected European Player of the Year
and sold to Milan for 100 mill. Kr.

793
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:37,956
If he scores three goals a match,
I'm content.

794
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,549
Henrik Larsen... Yes!

795
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:10,309
Henrik Larsen, after 20 minutes.

796
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:18,552
Lots of Danish fans didn't like
Richard Møller's choice of Henrik, -

797
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:22,719
- but we tip our hats to them both.

798
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:28,988
They can't find each other.
The French have got big problems.

799
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:36,390
Papin elbows Christofte in the face.
There you see it.

800
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:41,116
- It seemed pretty deliberate.
- Hey, he thought he owned the game.

801
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:49,113
He hasn't shown his teeth yet
but we can't afford to sit back.

802
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:55,111
What an ugly lunge
by Cantona.

803
01:24:55,320 --> 01:25:00,440
Look how he went in studs first
on John Jensen.

804
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:06,829
Fernandez... and Peter Schmeichel.
The French are closing in.

805
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:11,556
Only one Frenchman outside
the Danish penalty area.

806
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:16,231
Two men in the air...
Great opportunity for Laurent Blanc.

807
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:19,193
Bad luck, but great for us.

808
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:23,916
Get rid of it, Sivebæk.
He blocks it.

809
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:29,319
Right now Denmark's in the semis,
but there are 12 minutes left.

810
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:32,637
Papin isn't offside.

811
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:39,712
Jean-Pierre draws level. He doesn't
need a lot of room to score.

812
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:46,519
This is so undeserved.
The French don't deserve to qualify.

813
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:52,909
They've been so bad. Denmark
would be a better semifinalist.

814
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:58,035
They're on a roll now.
Cantona... Papin is on his way.

815
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:02,870
And Deschamps! Thank God, they
couldn't agree on who was to shoot.

816
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:08,518
<i>The French are putting on the heat.</i>
<i>Richard makes an unpopular call.</i>

817
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:14,431
<i>He substitutes our creative ace</i>
<i>Brian Laudrup with Lars Elstrup.</i>

818
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:21,239
I never look at who's good or bad,
but who can strengthen the team.

819
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,796
Elstrup... Sivebæk.

820
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:30,279
Flemming Povlsen isn't offside.
Blast! But it's still alive...

821
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:35,952
Yes! Lars Elstrup did it!

822
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:45,111
Terrific. 2-1 to Denmark.
Great timing.

823
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:53,192
Now it's official: Denmark is
in the Euro 92 semifinals -

824
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:56,437
- albeit our entry into the
tournament was a bit unfortunate.

825
01:26:56,640 --> 01:27:00,997
This is one of the greatest
Danish football achievements.

826
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,875
We went to McDonald's one night.

827
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:14,916
Had a German player suggested that,
he'd have been sent home.

828
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:20,478
If we'd lost against France,
I'd have been branded a fool.

829
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:26,516
The word "pride"
isn't part of my vocabulary.

830
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:33,910
My wife keeps admonishing me
to stop telling everyone -

831
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:38,557
- I only went to school every
second day, because people can tell.

832
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:42,309
The players have evolved -

833
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:48,550
- into exactly the kind
of types I want.

834
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:53,038
They like to have fun
and pull each others' legs.

835
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,470
They like a beer or two.

836
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:59,753
Some of us players still need
to earn the last big bucks.

837
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:05,034
When the papers write
I'm washed up, it annoys me.

838
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:07,356
How do you play Holland?

839
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:12,315
They want to control the game
from the very start.

840
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:18,038
We have to deploy our best weapon
which is the counter attack.

841
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:20,754
Does Denmark stand a chance?

842
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:25,476
Sure, although everyone talks about
Germany and Holland in the final.

843
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:31,232
It suits the Danes to be underdogs.
They have nothing to lose.

844
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:35,319
Gullit, Van Basten, Frank Rijkaard -

845
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:39,798
- are the Kohl, Mitterand and Major's
of football. Do you stand a chance?

846
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:45,837
Look, last week I said
they'd fight to the last -

847
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:52,513
- but this time they're going
to fight till they drop for Denmark.

848
01:28:55,680 --> 01:29:01,550
<i>Europe is amazed to see Denmark</i>
<i>in a European Championships semi.</i>

849
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:07,949
Expectations are high on this
big day in Danish football history.

850
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:14,429
The Danish holiday boys
meet the Euro favourites.

851
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:20,636
Holland presents
its strongest line-up.

852
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:24,469
No. 8, Frank Rijkaard, no. 9,
Van Basten and no. 10, Ruud Gullit.

853
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:29,071
Brian Laudrup is not offside
but Jan Wouters is on his tail.

854
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,317
Here comes Vilfort...

855
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:36,354
Laudrup... takes on Koeman.

856
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:40,473
- Good cross!
- Christ, there I go again and score.

857
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:46,670
Henrik Larsen!
What a fabulous start.

858
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:54,116
- I can't believe it's true.
- It is. Look at the scoreboard.

859
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:59,235
It was tough to fight mr. Rijkaard.
I'm no match for him.

860
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:03,319
Rijkaard in the air
with Henrik Larsen. Bergkamp!

861
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:10,628
- It bounced under Peter's hand.
- It hit the ground in front of him.

862
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,319
Bergkamp equalizes.

863
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:15,432
It's not always nice -

864
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:21,397
- when you're almost ready
to commit murder to win a game.

865
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:27,152
But the people who possess that
trait infect the rest of the team.

866
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:30,272
Flemming to Brian Laudrup
and then Henrik Larsen!

867
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:35,952
- I couldn't believe it.
- With his right foot.

868
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:40,153
This is insane!

869
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:45,388
If they keep this up,
they'll become European Champions.

870
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:53,632
It boosts their self-confidence.
Soon they'll be walking on water.

871
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:59,153
Flemming Povlsen... Hey! Right
on the edge of the penalty area.

872
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:03,669
Brian Laudrup...

873
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:09,477
I'm surprised that such
an experienced player -

874
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:14,151
- has had problems
handling the Danes.

875
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:23,395
Lars Olsen and Lars Elstrup...
Henrik Andersen is hurt.

876
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:30,870
That doesn't look good.
He collided with Marco van Basten.

877
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:42,552
What a sad exit for the guy who's
been the most uplifting of them all.

878
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:50,713
If we make the final, we'll miss
Henrik. He's been brilliant.

879
01:31:55,960 --> 01:32:02,069
I'd never seen a knee cap break
like that. It was hard to carry on.

880
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:04,953
Denmark is out of substitutes.

881
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:09,358
They're throwing everyone
into our penalty area -

882
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:13,519
- except Van Tiggelen
and keeper Van Breukelen.

883
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:19,558
Oh no, say it isn't true.

884
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:25,517
Four minutes from the final
but Frank Rijkaard ruined it for us.

885
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:31,078
Rijkaard again...
Well done, Peter Schmeichel.

886
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:36,115
The Danes have got concrete legs.
Now what? Gullit...

887
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:39,357
I have to stand up now.

888
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:47,672
I daren't turn back time, Preben,
not with you here, to 1984.

889
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:51,350
Just be happy I'm up here.

890
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:55,075
Ronald Koeman from FC Barcelona.

891
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:59,831
Henrik Larsen with tired legs.

892
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:06,070
I've missed a few penalty shots so
Sepp would never have let me kick.

893
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:11,639
He touched it with both hands.

894
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:16,879
Elstrup!

895
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:19,275
Well done.

896
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:22,711
Yes, Vilfort.

897
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:27,990
Flemming Povlsen is next.

898
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:33,115
Van Breukelen, his old club mate,
tries to psych him out.

899
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:38,189
- Get lost, he says.
- The referee should stop that.

900
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:49,232
This is absurd. Flemming was ready
to kick, and he calls them both over.

901
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:09,792
I knew he'd try to provoke me. Not
that he'd had his game on that night.

902
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,958
Let's pray for Flemming.

903
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:19,076
- After the ball's in, he's helpless.
- Alright, Flemming!

904
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:25,116
Marco van Basten is usually
steady as a rock for Milan.

905
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:35,950
Schmeichel takes it!
Alright, Peter Schmeichel!

906
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:43,237
Now it's all up to Kim Christofte.

907
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:49,150
I bet he feels the pressure.

908
01:34:56,080 --> 01:35:02,553
There are 11 metres from the spot
to Van Breukelen.

909
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:05,399
Kim Christofte.

910
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:11,072
- He adjusts the ball.
- Adding to the excitement.

911
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:46,037
I didn't have the nerve.
I was beat -

912
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:50,438
- and couldn't even muster up
the strength to kick.

913
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:53,200
And the others are better than me.

914
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:57,313
John Jensen.
Alright, John Jensen.

915
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:02,275
Yes, John Jensen! Oh, no!

916
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:07,238
John Jensen... Wide.

917
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:11,718
John Jensen... Good try.

918
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:16,277
I've trained and trained Faxe
and he never hit anything.

919
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:23,192
- You told Faxe to shoot, right?
- No, I told him to stay way back.

920
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:26,597
John Jensen...

921
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:30,713
John Jensen shoots... Okay.

922
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:39,676
Second time running.

923
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:43,555
No, I hit the post again.

924
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:09,275
The Germans are a special sort.
They keep their distance.

925
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:17,398
Many people see German football
as predictable and unimaginative.

926
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:24,153
- Of course we'll beat the krauts!
- We'll eat them for breakfast.

927
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:28,638
How is Denmark going to win? The
Germans are bigger and stronger.

928
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:31,229
But they underestimate the Danes.

929
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:37,913
The Germans don't deserve to win.
They've won so often.

930
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:44,798
The Germans occupied us during the
war, so sure we want to beat them.

931
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,595
Welcome, Denmark.

932
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,553
Hysterical nationalism is
taking joy -

933
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:55,514
- in the sight of 22 grown men
chasing an inflated cow belly.

934
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:58,314
If that's how you feel, surf on.

935
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:01,757
This is Denmark's first final -

936
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:07,557
- whereas the Germans have tried it
ten times in the past 37 years.

937
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:17,870
Our little nation of five million
versus this giant of 78 million.

938
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:22,312
They've just as many football players
as we have inhabitants.

939
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:26,638
It's almost as if the Danish team
is on home ground.

940
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:31,436
Everyone is singing
the Danish national anthem.

941
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:39,672
Cars have been hooting all day.
It's bigger than Mexico.

942
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:43,589
Stefan Reuter... Sammer.

943
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:51,192
Stefan Reuter gets the opportunity.
Well done, Peter Schmeichel.

944
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:58,599
Flemming Povlsen passes to Brian.
Larsen and Vilfort have made the run.

945
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:02,952
Flemming Povlsen and Vilfort...
but also Bodo Illgner.

946
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:08,394
Get it.

947
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:12,229
John Jensen blocks it.

948
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:15,631
Klinsmann shoots...

949
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:22,552
Well done, Peter! Fantastic save.
He's a world-class keeper.

950
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:29,796
Flemming Povlsen against Kohler,
but he's a strong opponent.

951
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,390
Flemming continues.

952
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:36,829
Here comes John Jensen.

953
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:43,152
Yes!

954
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:51,278
John Faxe Jensen!

955
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:55,996
- I hit it right in the arse.
- The Crown Prince is cheering.

956
01:39:56,200 --> 01:40:01,228
Let's keep our fingers crossed.

957
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:07,390
The Germans are going to give it
their all.

958
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:14,950
- Bertie Vogts always stands up.
- Or else he can't see, the midget.

959
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:19,358
Klinsmann feints...

960
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:21,915
Incredible!

961
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:27,675
Schmeichel, thank you!

962
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:33,318
The Germans never give up.
Thomas Doll.

963
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:38,756
- Again Schmeichel goes out.
- We're pressed, but we're scoring.

964
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:45,991
It must be frustrating to own
the game, and still Denmark scores.

965
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:49,237
Schmeichel with one hand!

966
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:55,475
- It's ours. Are you pessimistic?
- No, but I'm pissing my pants.

967
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:03,273
Kim Vilfort... and again. Yes!

968
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:10,112
This just can't be true, Preben.

969
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:25,352
Montgomery says the German forces
have capitulated.

970
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:30,111
Denmark's greatest triumph is a fact.

971
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:54,835
Flemming cried and that made me
want to cry, so I kept away from him.

972
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:18,757
- Brian, have you talked to Michael?
- No, he's on holiday.

973
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:22,350
- Looking forward to it?
- No.

974
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:54,273
We felt this great surge
of gratitude towards everyone -

975
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:58,029
- because we did it.

976
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:05,993
The Lord had decorated the waysides
with red poppies and white daisies.

977
