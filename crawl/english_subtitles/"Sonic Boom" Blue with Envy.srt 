2
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,081
             Grrr!

3
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:22,355
 I don't care what anyone says.

4
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,257
          Meh Burgers
     are the best burgers.

5
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:29,028
     Mm! It's like Mardi Gras
           in my mouth.

6
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:32,031
    Only no one in my mouth
     is handing out beads.

7
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:38,237
           (All) Huh?

8
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,241
        What will he do
     with that skateboard?

9
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:44,277
  I think he's gonna ride it.

10
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:46,979
           (All) Ooh!

11
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:50,149
What? He's riding a skateboard.
    How is that impressive?

12
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,299
         He's got serious
        street-wise style.

13
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,401
    He's jumping six inches
        off the ground.

14
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,408
         Radical speed!

15
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,845
        (Villagers gasp)

16
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,113
     Oh, for the love of...

17
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:23,115
        Wow, those were
       some sweet moves!

18
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,117
          Thanks, bro.

19
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:27,320
          You hear that?
        He called me bro.

20
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,322
          Yeah, I heard.
     He's quite a wordsmith.

21
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,926
 It's Swifty. Swifty the Shrew.

22
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:36,062
          I don't see
    what the fuss is about.

23
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,431
       He's just a shrew
       in gaudy clothes.

24
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,433
           I got it.

25
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:48,407
    You... caught my burger.

26
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,410
       Radical... speed.

27
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,919
         Radical speed.

28
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,822
  Give me a break. I can feed
   people sandwiches. Watch.

29
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,259
  (Coughs) Hey, lay off, man!

30
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:10,196
      Help! Help! My baby!

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,700
          Somebody needs
        to help that baby.

32
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:18,004
 Say no more, compadre bromigo.

33
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,506
        Time for some...

34
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,375
        (All except Sonic)
          Radical speed.

35
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:23,476
            (Groans)

36
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:29,248
       - (Excited gasps)
- Well, I'm saving the day too.

37
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:33,719
 Time for some rescuing baby...

38
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,322
      action... hero-ness?

39
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,793
        I'll figure out
      a catchphrase later.

40
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,897
           (All) Wow!

41
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,534
        Ow, my retinas!

42
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,370
             Glue!
   Get your fresh glue here.

43
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,477
              Ugh!

44
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:17,563
  Remember, when you need a hero
   with style, give me a call.

45
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,132
     I'm Swifty the Shrew.

46
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:23,202
       Catch you around,
    dudes... and lady-dudes.

47
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,273
 I'd love to be his lady-dude.
              Oh!

48
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,475
          Me too. Oh!

49
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,043
        Fainting party!

50
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:32,845
              Agh!

51
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:39,085
    Lousy Swifty and his lousy
  in-your-face streetwise style.

52
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,920
     Lousy hip urban lingo.

53
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:45,224
 Did you see the way he pulled
down his sunglasses and winked?

54
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,059
       Oh, he's perfect.

55
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:50,563
I know. If he ever visited me,
I'd disable all my booby traps.

56
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:53,332
       You never disable
       your booby traps.

57
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,934
            I know!

58
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,569
            (Groans)

59
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:06,112
     This is one bodacious
    radical flying machine,

60
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,513
       duderino bro-guy.

61
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,915
       Duderino bro-guy?

62
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,118
      (Both) Totally radical
           engineering!

63
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:13,319
            (Laughs)

64
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:18,257
   Hey, that's my best friend
   you're bonding with, punk.

65
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,927
     Whoa, chillax, blue man.
      What's the big dealio?

66
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,130
          The big dealio
       is I'm sick of you.

67
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,931
             I'm sick
     of your gelled-back fur

68
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,634
 and I'm sick of your hip urban
 lingo with words like dealio.

69
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,604
 Let's not go aggro, brozilla.

70
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:34,507
            Can't help
  if I'm more handsome, styling

71
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,042
  and totally faster than you.

72
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,044
   You're not faster than me.

73
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,182
     Bro, you've got speed,
     but not radical speed.

74
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,484
       Stop saying that!
     It's not even a thing.

75
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,319
         Radical speed
      is totally a thing.

76
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,622
   A race around the village
      will prove it isn't.

77
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,325
         Ah, sounds dope.
   Winner gets bragging rights.

78
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:57,463
           - Agreed.
  - And the loser leaves town.

79
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,564
         Wait... what?

80
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,599
        If you don't think
     you've got the skills...

81
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,601
 I've got the skills all right.

82
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,504
    I'm so full of skills that
 they're leaking out of my ears.

83
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,873
          Not literally.
    That would be disgusting.

84
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,177
      See you at the race.

85
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:17,216
  Man, can you believe that guy?
         What a lameoid.

86
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,652
           That lameoid
        is my best friend.

87
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:23,355
 - That didn't come out right.
 - Swifty, you're the lameoid.

88
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,125
   You're one thousand times
   the lameoid that Sonic is.

89
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,627
 But look at my flashy threads
        and fly shades.

90
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,231
      Yeah, look at his
flashy threads and fly shades.

91
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,499
           Knuckles!

92
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,167
        Swifty, get out.

93
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:39,171
  So long, losers. Swifty out!

94
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:49,381
           (Cheering)

95
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:56,555
 Ladies and gentlemen, prepare
  for the race of a lifetime.

96
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,591
       The winner will have
        the right to brag

97
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,093
whenever and wherever he wants.

98
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:05,431
       The loser will um...
         let's see now...

99
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,167
   be banished from the village
             forever.

100
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,973
    That seems a little harsh,
       but rules are rules.

101
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,342
           (Cheering)

102
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,445
     Racers, on your marks.

103
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,613
            Get set.

104
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,382
              Go!

105
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,291
           How the...

106
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,226
   What if Sonic doesn't win?

107
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,562
            He'll win.
   Nobody's faster than Sonic.

108
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:44,637
         Radical speed!

109
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,438
  Radical shut your pie hole!

110
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,713
             Ha-ha!

111
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,216
           OK, I won.

112
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:00,352
         This is the part
      where everyone cheers.

113
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,655
           (Cheering)

114
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:10,729
       Radical smoothie.

115
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,667
      He won? With time
to get a smoothie? But... how?

116
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,735
    I passed him. I saw it.

117
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,737
      Something smells fishy
         about this race.

118
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:23,309
        I told you! I have
     irritable bowl syndrome.

119
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:28,580
  Ahem. I think it's time for
someone to be all banished, yo.

120
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,351
      Sonic the Hedgehog,

121
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:39,358
 in accordance with town byelaw
77415, subsection B paragraph 9,

122
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:43,262
    I hereby declare you...
        uh... banished.

123
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,353
              No.

124
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,189
              No.

125
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,794
              No.

126
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,667
          I can't accept
       that Sonic is gone.

127
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,370
   But Sonic is gone! Ha-ha!

128
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:28,374
   You all fell victim to the
charms of my greatest robot yet.

129
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:31,577
            - A robot?
  - More like an army of robots.

130
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,846
      (All) Radical speed!

131
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,781
  Sonic didn't lose the race.

132
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,751
     There were just multiple
  Swifties all along the track.

133
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,519
      I call shenanigans!

134
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,755
 It's too late for shenanigans.

135
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,824
   Now, without your precious
   hedgehog hero to stop me,

136
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,461
       I can finally fulfil
     my lifelong evil dream.

137
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,298
  Building my own theme park.

138
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,268
 That doesn't sound very evil.

139
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,836
 It might even create new jobs.

140
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,338
            Silence!

141
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,806
    In my theme park empire

142
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,243
  your entire village will be
 forced to wait in long lines,

143
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,711
      buy overpriced merch

144
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:10,582
   and eat week-old turkey legs
    covered in preservatives.

145
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,351
          (All shriek)

146
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:15,721
         And remember,
  it all started with a shrew.

147
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,593
          (All scream)

148
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,465
            Waargh!

149
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,236
         We need Sonic!

150
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,477
           Ha-ha-ha!

151
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,513
        Get Sonic back!

152
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,883
Oh, well, it's not that simple.
      He's been banished.

153
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,685
      Then un-banish him.

154
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,288
I can't just un-banish someone.

155
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,424
    Un-banishing requires an
assembly of the village council.

156
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,626
      Then assemble them.

157
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,829
   I suppose I could do that.

158
00:09:57,163 --> 00:10:01,300
      I hereby call to order
  the un-banishing proceedings.

159
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,937
          OK, let's see.
      Hedgehog comma Sonic.

160
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,738
       Middle name: The.

161
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,943
      Now, where oh where
     is his 1087-Q1B form?

162
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,644
      Just do it already!

163
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,947
         All in favour
     of un-banishing Sonic

164
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,882
   so he can save our lives,
           say "aye".

165
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,950
           (All) Aye!

166
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,652
          - All opposed?
              - Nay.

167
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:23,789
      I hereby declare Sonic
           un-banished.

168
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,892
  - (Over radio) Un-banished.
          - Go ahead.

169
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,936
        (All) Unradical!

170
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,680
          (All cheer)

171
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,682
         My theme park!

172
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,752
    I was gonna make a killing
         off that merch.

173
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,487
              Ugh!

174
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,623
             Aargh!

175
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,791
   Catch you later, Eggface.

176
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,361
          - (Cheering)
          - I did it!

177
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,829
     I have a catchphrase.

178
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:07,900
        (Clears throat)
   Catch you later, Eggface.

179
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,701
      (All laugh politely)

180
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,439
             Ha!
Catch you... later... Eggface.

181
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:15,841
          (All groan)

182
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,776
    Let's not kill it, son.

182
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:24,677
