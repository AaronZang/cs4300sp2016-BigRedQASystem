3
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:49,457
Have you ever been
to such a jovial party?

4
00:00:49,577 --> 00:00:53,244
I couldn't agree more.

5
00:00:53,364 --> 00:00:55,498
I'm glad I came when I did.

6
00:00:55,618 --> 00:01:00,428
It was an idea I had to gather
all the youth in the town.

7
00:01:00,548 --> 00:01:04,422
Though in truth
I can't take all the credit.

8
00:01:07,765 --> 00:01:09,639
She wants a man like crazy.

9
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:12,468
As though she could handle one.

10
00:01:12,588 --> 00:01:15,117
I heard she's addicted to pills.

11
00:01:15,237 --> 00:01:18,090
Oh, you shouldn't say anything.

12
00:02:00,568 --> 00:02:01,892
She sings beautifully.

13
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:04,193
Yes she does.

14
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,501
Who is she? Do I know her?

15
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,163
She's the daughter
of a prominent man in town.

16
00:02:13,253 --> 00:02:16,448
There's a lot of money in
that family as I understand it.

17
00:02:21,265 --> 00:02:24,138
- Mind if I have a quick drink?
- Have all you want.

18
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:28,500
Thanks.

19
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,206
You're very pretty, aren't you?

20
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:39,590
Excuse me?

21
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,276
Did they throw this party for you?

22
00:02:41,396 --> 00:02:42,600
Me? I'm nobody.

23
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,816
Ah, I see.

24
00:02:43,936 --> 00:02:46,404
She's not just pretty.
She's divine!

25
00:02:46,524 --> 00:02:47,970
She doesn't like you.

26
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,137
Listen, I won't be
pretty forever.

27
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:52,004
You might as well move along.

28
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:07,610
Will you dance with me?

29
00:03:09,842 --> 00:03:10,805
All right.

30
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:05,587
You have no shame!

31
00:04:05,707 --> 00:04:07,694
- You're leaving?
- I hate you.

32
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,079
And yet I like you
more than anyone else.

33
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,856
- You're so typical.
- Calm down. I'm only joking.

34
00:04:14,148 --> 00:04:16,461
- Can't you take it?
- You're fresh.

35
00:04:16,581 --> 00:04:18,628
A fresh man
is just what you need.

36
00:04:18,748 --> 00:04:20,012
You make me sick!

37
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:22,568
Very good then.

38
00:04:22,688 --> 00:04:24,527
I don't mean to interrupt.

39
00:04:24,647 --> 00:04:27,863
- I have something I want to talk to you about.
- Of course, let's go.

40
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:34,137
- What are you up to?
- I don't know.

41
00:04:34,882 --> 00:04:35,982
You look sad.

42
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,892
Don't bring us all down with you.

43
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:40,274
I have bigger things to
worry about than that.

44
00:04:40,394 --> 00:04:42,562
But this is a party.
Live a little.

45
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:43,979
Leave me alone.

46
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:47,378
- Do you have any hair left to lose?
- That's my business, not yours.

47
00:04:47,498 --> 00:04:50,487
Well you're no fun. I'll go find
someone else to bother.

48
00:04:52,495 --> 00:04:55,384
- Well, when are you returning to Madrid?
- Very soon.

49
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,153
Shame you'll miss
the big party we're having.

50
00:04:58,273 --> 00:05:01,166
- Who?
- Everyone. Us, our friends.

51
00:05:02,126 --> 00:05:04,113
You can have your fun!

52
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:07,486
- Please, don't get jealous.
- I'm just as God made me.

53
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:09,411
You shouldn't worry so much.

54
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:12,041
- Darling, you're overreacting.
- Obviously.

55
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:14,329
Don't take me for a fool!

56
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:16,436
For God's sake,
you're a nervous wreck.

57
00:05:16,556 --> 00:05:17,858
Think what you want.

58
00:05:17,978 --> 00:05:21,101
I'm the one who has to see him
on the arms of other women.

59
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:34,656
Oh, poor thing.

60
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:40,035
Look at you now.
You've lost your mind.

61
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:46,726
It's nothing. Clear out.

62
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:19,715
- Candelas.
- If you come near me I'll jump in the lake.

63
00:06:19,835 --> 00:06:21,664
Well I wouldn't want you to drown.

64
00:06:21,784 --> 00:06:23,883
- I like you alive.
- Please leave!

65
00:06:42,926 --> 00:06:45,611
- Going for a walk?
- Yes, by myself.

66
00:06:45,731 --> 00:06:47,540
- It's better with company.
- Let go of me.

67
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,031
- Not even a bit curious?
- No, you're spoken for.

68
00:06:50,015 --> 00:06:52,103
- So? So are you.
- But I don't love him.

69
00:06:52,223 --> 00:06:53,589
- Mine neither.
- Liar.

70
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:55,437
- Good bye!
- I won't let you leave.

71
00:06:55,557 --> 00:06:56,874
- Let go!
- Wait!

72
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:14,001
- Let go!
- How can I do that? You know how I feel.

73
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:16,619
- That doesn't change how I feel.
- Give it time.

74
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:18,039
- But...
- No!

75
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:20,690
Look me in the eyes and say no.

76
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:21,776
No.

77
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:23,658
Do it again.

78
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:24,776
I...

79
00:08:08,444 --> 00:08:10,007
Candelas, is that you?

80
00:08:10,785 --> 00:08:11,645
It's me.

81
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,705
But...

82
00:08:14,415 --> 00:08:19,334
- So your aunt finally threw you out.
- She said I was too much to bear.

83
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:22,181
Could I trouble you to take
me along with you?

84
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:24,418
Poor girl, where are you headed?

85
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:29,122
To find the father for this little girl
to see if he'll take us in.

86
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:31,545
It's my only hope.

87
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:34,422
Have you spoken lately?

88
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,544
No.

89
00:08:37,503 --> 00:08:40,730
But I have an idea
where he might be.

90
00:08:41,803 --> 00:08:44,773
Well I'm sure it's on my way.
Of course I'll take you.

91
00:08:50,825 --> 00:08:53,404
Now let's get to
the heart of the problem.

92
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:55,883
Why must we keep on with this?

93
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:59,965
We can't rush these things.
We have to finish what we started.

94
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,845
It brings me no pleasure.

95
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:08,098
If this were pleasurable, people would be
lining up in the streets to have your problem.

96
00:09:15,725 --> 00:09:17,238
Good day, gentlemen.

97
00:09:18,314 --> 00:09:20,173
- How are you, Arturo?
- Fine.

98
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:22,560
How are those lawyers treating you?

99
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,647
Very well. They're taking care of all
my legal worries for me.

100
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,453
Perhaps you can find other
uses for them as well.

101
00:09:29,573 --> 00:09:31,689
And what exactly are you up to now?

102
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:34,445
I'm conducting experiments
and observations

103
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:37,428
relating to hypnotism and somnambulism.

104
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,259
Oh, very interesting!

105
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,369
I find the subjects of my
experiements in town.

106
00:09:43,995 --> 00:09:45,430
Speaking of which...

107
00:09:46,147 --> 00:09:50,409
Have you seen any of those men who go
to sleep at night but then...

108
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,945
wander around?

109
00:09:52,065 --> 00:09:56,134
Men who go to sleep and stay asleep? Yes.
But those who go to sleep and wander around?

110
00:09:56,254 --> 00:09:57,279
Sorry, no.

111
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,526
What a shame.

112
00:09:58,646 --> 00:10:00,440
If there were such a man...

113
00:10:01,122 --> 00:10:02,660
I have prepared...

114
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,559
certain experiments.

115
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:06,672
At attention.

116
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:08,928
And you're relieved.

117
00:10:17,602 --> 00:10:21,409
Good to see the army hasn't
lowered its standards.

118
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:24,511
- They're gorgeous.
- Wait 'til I get my hands on them.

119
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:27,585
Remember girls, they're married
to the military.

120
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:29,228
They come and go.

121
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:36,087
- Angelillo.
- At your service.

122
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:38,669
You look capable. Fetch me some water.

123
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:39,839
Yes, sir.

124
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,872
- Tiburcio!
- What is it?

125
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:46,471
Are you deaf? Fill this up.

126
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:49,596
- But he told you to do it.
- And now I'm telling you.

127
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,251
You can shine shoes later.

128
00:10:51,371 --> 00:10:52,661
- But...
- Enough!

129
00:10:52,781 --> 00:10:53,704
Yes, sir.

130
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:06,176
- Hey, how did it go for you last night?
- Very well. What about you?

131
00:11:06,296 --> 00:11:07,303
Good. Very good.

132
00:11:07,423 --> 00:11:11,626
- You know how I operate.
- It didn't look like she cared much for you.

133
00:11:11,746 --> 00:11:13,427
Not much to work with in this town.

134
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:17,525
Listen, I could really use a breather.
Do you still sing?

135
00:11:17,645 --> 00:11:18,546
I can.

136
00:11:19,406 --> 00:11:21,848
- Why don't you sing us something?
- Well I...

137
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:24,157
- Come on.
- We could all use a song.

138
00:11:24,754 --> 00:11:26,473
Guys, come on over.

139
00:11:26,593 --> 00:11:28,889
- All right!
- Antonio, bring a guitar.

140
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:33,844
This is a song I first heard while
stationed in a remote town.

141
00:11:34,098 --> 00:11:35,082
Here we go.

142
00:12:44,226 --> 00:12:45,410
Play another!

143
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:53,782
Sergeant.

144
00:12:53,902 --> 00:12:54,924
Yes, sir?

145
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,361
You know I don't approve of
the men being boisterouos.

146
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:02,961
Of course sir. I will make sure that
there are no further outbursts.

147
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:06,664
Please do. As you know, the landlord
spends most of the day in his studies...

148
00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:09,591
- and does not wish to be disturbed.
- Yes, sir.

149
00:13:12,343 --> 00:13:14,333
Settle down. You know the drill.

150
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:17,210
When you sing in the army,
you each have your parts:

151
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,578
each one of you in absolute silence.

152
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:22,744
And that goes for walking as well.

153
00:13:32,691 --> 00:13:34,532
- Angelillo.
- Yes, sir?

154
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:36,804
- Have you shined my shin guards?
- Not yet, sir.

155
00:13:36,924 --> 00:13:38,789
Well what are you waiting for?

156
00:13:38,909 --> 00:13:40,153
Right away, sir.

157
00:13:50,244 --> 00:13:52,281
- Tiburcio!
- What do you want?

158
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:55,725
You didn't hear? The officer needs
these shined.

159
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:57,751
You can't order me around like he can.

160
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:59,557
Don't pull rank on me.

161
00:13:59,677 --> 00:14:01,383
Ranks you'll never have.

162
00:14:01,503 --> 00:14:03,566
- Just spit and shut up.
- I'm out of spit.

163
00:14:03,847 --> 00:14:06,382
I've cleaned 20 of these today.

164
00:14:06,658 --> 00:14:09,139
You'll keep going until they're all done.

165
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:13,777
Not on your life!

166
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:16,363
I get the chain of command.

167
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:21,147
But what do you do when those in command
are the ones that need the chain?

168
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:28,510
I'll just dry out then.

169
00:14:31,582 --> 00:14:33,171
What are you doing here?

170
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:37,767
- You should be on maneuvers.
- But sergeant, I was told to...

171
00:14:37,887 --> 00:14:39,894
Leave the chores to the donkeys.

172
00:14:40,014 --> 00:14:41,894
- Now, go!
- I'd rather have the donkeys' job.

173
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,433
Leave these as though they
were the boots of demons.

174
00:14:44,553 --> 00:14:47,002
But they're worse. They're officers' boots.

175
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,753
- Enough!
- Yes, sir.

176
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:52,946
At attention.

177
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:54,877
Forward.

178
00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:56,352
March.

179
00:14:56,632 --> 00:15:02,320
One...Two...

180
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,406
Halt.

181
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:07,044
One...Two...

182
00:15:07,164 --> 00:15:07,882
Halt!

183
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:12,225
- Did you not hear me say halt?
- Yes, but I wasn't finished marching.

184
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:15,554
- Back in formation.
- One...Two...

185
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:17,442
Keep it to yourself. Private.

186
00:15:17,562 --> 00:15:19,389
- Yes, sir?
- Not you, private.

187
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:20,627
Yes, sir.

188
00:15:20,747 --> 00:15:22,203
Now, let's try again.

189
00:15:22,648 --> 00:15:23,614
Attention.

190
00:15:24,054 --> 00:15:27,041
Forward three paces. Then turn to the left.

191
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,562
Advance.

192
00:15:30,358 --> 00:15:32,057
Well, I got the head part right.

193
00:15:32,177 --> 00:15:34,920
- Private, you're taking everyone off guard.
- Yes, sir?

194
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,542
- Not you!
- Yes, sir.

195
00:15:36,662 --> 00:15:38,105
Fall in.

196
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:40,959
Where are you going?

197
00:15:47,805 --> 00:15:52,101
Since you can't handle basic orders
we're going to try something simpler.

198
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:54,196
Face left.

199
00:15:54,617 --> 00:15:55,465
March.

200
00:15:56,454 --> 00:15:59,519
Damn it! What did I do to deserve this?

201
00:16:01,034 --> 00:16:02,292
You, up in front.

202
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:03,636
Yes, sir.

203
00:16:04,065 --> 00:16:05,420
Which is your left?

204
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,412
- I'm still not clear on that.
- All right.

205
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:11,917
Which leg goes first when
you start to march?

206
00:16:13,016 --> 00:16:13,946
This one.

207
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,013
And which leg is that?

208
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:17,780
This other one's friend.

209
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,670
- Which foot are you standing on?
- One of them.

210
00:16:21,234 --> 00:16:23,076
But how many feet do you have?

211
00:16:23,196 --> 00:16:23,945
Six.

212
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:28,305
And where are all of them? Let's see.

213
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,492
One.

214
00:16:30,172 --> 00:16:30,886
Two.

215
00:16:31,477 --> 00:16:33,285
And the other four I'm not sure.

216
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:37,485
But people have always said
I had six feet like a flea...

217
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:39,920
as well as other flea-like traits.

218
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:42,162
I ought to squash you like one.

219
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:44,930
Let's try again.

220
00:16:45,202 --> 00:16:46,681
Everyone at attention.

221
00:16:47,024 --> 00:16:49,223
Your left leg is the one on this side.

222
00:16:50,058 --> 00:16:52,362
It's the one we use to start marching.

223
00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:54,719
Understood? You should have it by now.

224
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:57,275
Let's see if you've learned Tiburcio.

225
00:16:57,395 --> 00:16:59,321
Which one is your right leg?

226
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:04,977
This one.

227
00:17:05,614 --> 00:17:06,839
And this one?

228
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,257
- He's the shy one.
- You just won't learn, will you?

229
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:12,069
What nerve!

230
00:17:12,494 --> 00:17:14,903
The rest of you now, fall in.

231
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:17,216
Attention.

232
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,297
Face left.

233
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:21,000
Forward.

234
00:17:21,701 --> 00:17:22,492
March.

235
00:17:22,765 --> 00:17:25,032
One...Two...

236
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,539
And where is he going now?

237
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:31,385
Keep marching until you're far enough
away I never have to see you again.

238
00:17:31,645 --> 00:17:33,458
Which way again was left?

239
00:17:33,722 --> 00:17:36,605
Onward, onward until you run into a wall.

240
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:51,347
Well, I'll leave you here.

241
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:53,649
The city is that way.

242
00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:56,759
It may take some time but
you should be able to find it.

243
00:17:56,879 --> 00:17:58,184
Thanks so much.

244
00:17:58,304 --> 00:17:59,958
It was nothing. Good luck.

245
00:18:00,491 --> 00:18:02,878
If you find him, remember what I told you.

246
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:04,346
Farewell.

247
00:18:14,478 --> 00:18:16,962
- Could we sleep here tonight?
- Of course.

248
00:18:17,824 --> 00:18:19,648
- Good bye now.
- Take care.

249
00:18:20,177 --> 00:18:21,827
I can't pay you now.

250
00:18:22,156 --> 00:18:25,050
- If not now, when?
- I'm looking for a man in town.

251
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,351
If I find him I'll pay you tomorrow.

252
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,802
Is he far?

253
00:18:29,344 --> 00:18:31,181
Yes, especially with this one.

254
00:18:31,531 --> 00:18:32,752
She's your girl?

255
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:34,120
She is.

256
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:36,746
Well come in.

257
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:40,483
- It's not worth quibbling about.
- Many thanks.

258
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,455
You startled me.

259
00:19:14,006 --> 00:19:14,682
Hey.

260
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:17,799
How much would you charge
to write a letter for me?

261
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,587
40 cents. At least.

262
00:19:20,173 --> 00:19:20,804
40?

263
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,699
I've seen you do it for others for less.
How about 30?

264
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:29,588
- No. Your letters are too long.
- I swear this one won't be.

265
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:30,950
Fine then.

266
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:33,370
Dictate...

267
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:35,981
and if it's short I'll lower the price.

268
00:19:46,214 --> 00:19:47,155
Go ahead.

269
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:51,217
My dearest, most tender Marli

270
00:19:52,511 --> 00:19:55,635
I wish you all the best that I can offer.

271
00:19:56,223 --> 00:20:00,242
Good health and thoughts of me to
comfort you while I am away.

272
00:20:02,137 --> 00:20:02,876
etc.

273
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:05,325
etc.

274
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,892
I come to you now with my heart very full.

275
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:16,359
You must know how grateful I would
be with all of my heart and soul...

276
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:21,719
to hear some news of you and to know
that I am also in your thoughts.

277
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:24,652
How am I doing?

278
00:20:24,977 --> 00:20:27,246
You have twenty words left.

279
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,906
Can't you use more contractions?

280
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,329
And that's all I have to say now
because I'm tired.

281
00:20:36,172 --> 00:20:38,706
The table's legs were sore

282
00:20:38,826 --> 00:20:43,418
Because holding the child up atop it
Had proved quite a chore

283
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,663
Tiburcio Canales.

284
00:20:53,534 --> 00:20:54,262
Done.

285
00:20:54,657 --> 00:20:56,296
- Did you sign it?
- Yes.

286
00:21:01,414 --> 00:21:04,584
Hey, you know how that rooster
is always waking us up?

287
00:21:05,113 --> 00:21:07,033
- That one just now?
- The same.

288
00:21:07,153 --> 00:21:08,852
- I have an idea.
- What?

289
00:21:08,972 --> 00:21:09,975
Follow me.

290
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:12,679
Everyone.

291
00:21:13,768 --> 00:21:16,602
Anyone who will help me, get up now.

292
00:21:18,428 --> 00:21:21,203
We've taken orders from this
rooster long enough.

293
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:23,513
It's time to revolt.
Who's with me?

294
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,704
The rooster really has no earthly clue

295
00:21:29,824 --> 00:21:32,266
Just what we are about to do

296
00:21:32,714 --> 00:21:37,589
For if the rooster would have heard us creep
The rooster would not still remain asleep

297
00:21:38,528 --> 00:21:41,077
- I'm terribly scared
- You are an idiot

298
00:21:41,197 --> 00:21:43,505
What will our superiors think?

299
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,218
But he was a good rooster

300
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:48,253
- No one will even miss him
- Watch them throw us in the clink

301
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:49,939
Let's see them try!

302
00:21:51,364 --> 00:21:53,812
- Fine, I trust you
- And so I go

303
00:21:53,932 --> 00:21:55,418
The rooster in tow

304
00:21:56,618 --> 00:22:00,185
- Be careful
- Don't worry, I've done this before

305
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:13,465
For the cause of silence

306
00:22:16,932 --> 00:22:18,359
Finally we can rest.

307
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:21,473
- We have to do something with it.
- Kill the tyrant!

308
00:22:25,295 --> 00:22:26,416
Settle down.

309
00:22:27,161 --> 00:22:28,330
At attention.

310
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:30,243
Take this.

311
00:22:30,818 --> 00:22:32,197
What will we say?

312
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:36,213
The rooster got sick, the ambulance
came, but then it got lost.

313
00:22:36,514 --> 00:22:38,262
Where are all of you going?

314
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,375
To find someone who can give
us all a good shave.

315
00:22:43,183 --> 00:22:45,648
Laugh it up. You'll get yours.

316
00:22:47,036 --> 00:22:49,266
Never mind her. Head towards the back.

317
00:22:52,977 --> 00:22:54,346
Angelillo, wait.

318
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:56,924
Damn.

319
00:22:57,331 --> 00:22:58,691
What are you doing?

320
00:22:59,258 --> 00:23:00,543
Run away bulls.

321
00:23:00,663 --> 00:23:02,465
I repeat, what are you doing?

322
00:23:03,123 --> 00:23:04,346
I don't know.

323
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:07,817
- I'm asleep.
- Asleep? Can it be?

324
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:09,888
Let's find out.

325
00:23:10,547 --> 00:23:12,076
Let me see your eyes.

326
00:23:12,594 --> 00:23:13,584
My eyes?

327
00:23:15,902 --> 00:23:17,363
I am a soothsayer.

328
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:21,346
Why have you ordered the men
to run off with the rooster?

329
00:23:22,203 --> 00:23:23,735
Because every night...

330
00:23:24,516 --> 00:23:26,342
I say three Hail Mary's...

331
00:23:27,425 --> 00:23:29,930
and I am made aware of the will...

332
00:23:31,178 --> 00:23:32,995
of the rooster's keeper.

333
00:23:33,848 --> 00:23:35,281
You speak of devils?

334
00:23:36,637 --> 00:23:37,760
I hear them.

335
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:40,912
Do you sense that you are asleep?

336
00:23:41,032 --> 00:23:41,769
I do.

337
00:23:42,075 --> 00:23:43,522
Well then, sit down.

338
00:23:44,483 --> 00:23:45,349
Where?

339
00:23:45,469 --> 00:23:46,874
In that chair.

340
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,544
Go on, sit down.

341
00:23:56,106 --> 00:23:57,396
Why do you snore?

342
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:58,819
Bad habit.

343
00:23:59,457 --> 00:24:01,434
Sit up straight. Can you sing?

344
00:24:01,554 --> 00:24:02,549
No, sir.

345
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:05,632
- Well you have to sing something.
- But if I don't know how...

346
00:24:05,752 --> 00:24:06,591
You do!

347
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:09,520
Fine then, I do, but I have no guitar.

348
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:11,171
No matter.

349
00:24:11,728 --> 00:24:13,177
I told you to sing.

350
00:24:20,303 --> 00:24:22,210
If the officers only knew

351
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,256
That I am the most valiant

352
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:26,424
And the troops respect me

353
00:24:26,544 --> 00:24:29,778
They would see I'm the man for the job

354
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:32,458
But they just take me for granted

355
00:24:32,578 --> 00:24:36,854
They abandon me here with this other dreck
to drink away all of my sorrows

356
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:40,888
And here I am trafficking poultry
just to pass the time

357
00:24:41,008 --> 00:24:44,615
They abandoned him here with the rest of us
to drink away all of his sorrows

358
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:48,837
And here I am trafficking poultry
just to pass the time

359
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,377
Here is a medical insignia

360
00:24:54,497 --> 00:24:56,323
And that's worth a lot

361
00:24:56,443 --> 00:24:58,808
If you want to go far as a medic

362
00:24:58,928 --> 00:25:04,928
But it's of little use to you if you
wish to be a veterinarian

363
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:09,358
They abandon me here with this other dreck
to drink away all of my sorrows

364
00:25:09,478 --> 00:25:13,733
And here I am trafficking poultry
just to pass the time

365
00:25:13,853 --> 00:25:17,459
They abandoned him here with the rest of us
to drink away all of his sorrows

366
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:21,782
And here I am trafficking poultry
just to pass the time

367
00:25:25,195 --> 00:25:27,182
On the day of your baptism

368
00:25:27,302 --> 00:25:29,671
You heard over the radio

369
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:34,291
Your parents weren't sure if they'd keep you

370
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:37,553
They had their eye on the baby
in the other pew

371
00:25:37,673 --> 00:25:41,606
They abandon me here with this other dreck
to drink away all of my sorrows

372
00:25:41,726 --> 00:25:46,114
And here I am trafficking poultry
just to pass the time

373
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:50,270
They abandoned him here with the rest of us
to drink away all of his sorrows

374
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:53,822
And here I am trafficking poultry
just to pass the time

375
00:25:53,942 --> 00:25:56,318
Though if they call me up I'm ready

376
00:25:57,367 --> 00:25:59,273
Because I'm a good soldier

377
00:26:03,943 --> 00:26:05,568
If they'll have me

378
00:26:08,998 --> 00:26:10,203
What is this?

379
00:26:10,323 --> 00:26:12,282
I'll break you all into pieces.

380
00:26:12,611 --> 00:26:16,796
On your next day off we're going to the
barber's and cutting off all of your hair.

381
00:26:17,407 --> 00:26:18,872
Fall in! Attention!

382
00:26:19,975 --> 00:26:20,868
You.

383
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,046
I can't. I'm sleepwalking.

384
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:25,052
- Can't follow orders.
- I'll show you orders!

385
00:26:25,172 --> 00:26:27,841
- But sir, he really is asleep.
- So he thinks.

386
00:26:28,268 --> 00:26:31,479
This one is the most shameful of the lot.

387
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,747
He broke in and stole the rooster.

388
00:26:35,201 --> 00:26:36,616
- We'll see.
- Look.

389
00:26:36,736 --> 00:26:38,918
What do you have to say about this?

390
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:40,444
It's a dead rooster.

391
00:26:40,564 --> 00:26:41,317
Men.

392
00:26:41,748 --> 00:26:43,635
Who killed this bird?

393
00:26:47,026 --> 00:26:48,564
Examine their hands.

394
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,722
We need to see your hands.

395
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:02,457
Come on.

396
00:27:03,445 --> 00:27:04,407
Let's go.

397
00:27:05,027 --> 00:27:06,637
Where is that blood from?

398
00:27:06,757 --> 00:27:07,829
Bloody nose.

399
00:27:07,949 --> 00:27:09,839
Bloody nose? Huh, we'll see.

400
00:27:10,418 --> 00:27:11,736
Remove your caps.

401
00:27:13,528 --> 00:27:15,174
Did you not hear me?

402
00:27:16,137 --> 00:27:18,041
Where are those feathers from?

403
00:27:18,688 --> 00:27:21,674
I don't know. They could have
fallen out from my pillow.

404
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,725
- I'm detaining you.
- Well done. Well done.

405
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,130
- Then he wasn't sleepwalking?
- Give me a break.

406
00:27:37,306 --> 00:27:38,446
Angelillo.

407
00:27:39,192 --> 00:27:40,681
Yes, what do you need?

408
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:44,006
She's looking for a man named Arturo.
A handsome man.

409
00:27:45,493 --> 00:27:48,970
- I know many Arturos.
- Arturo Castellano. Do you know him?

410
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:52,355
I'll have to think about it. Hold on.

411
00:27:54,942 --> 00:27:56,727
I think I might know the guy.

412
00:27:56,989 --> 00:28:00,036
- Say, can babies eat nuts?
- No, but thank you.

413
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,805
Would you like some?

414
00:28:02,243 --> 00:28:04,672
- No thank you.
- More for me. Let's go.

415
00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:33,381
You?

416
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,621
What are you doing here?
This is the last thing I need.

417
00:28:38,741 --> 00:28:41,420
This does neither of us any good.
Please leave.

418
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,537
I just want you to see your daughter.

419
00:28:43,657 --> 00:28:46,645
Fine, just not now. You need to leave.

420
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:48,656
Go?

421
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,825
But where do I go?

422
00:28:50,945 --> 00:28:53,964
My aunt threw me out.
I don't know anyone else in town.

423
00:28:54,422 --> 00:28:56,764
Where in God's green Earth might I belong?

424
00:28:56,884 --> 00:28:58,776
This is not a good time for me.

425
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,113
I don't ask because you were with me once
but because I have no one else.

426
00:29:04,233 --> 00:29:09,148
But if you have a heart I beg you not
to leave us to die in the wilderness.

427
00:29:09,268 --> 00:29:12,447
- I would. It's just that I can't now.
- Give us something.

428
00:29:13,183 --> 00:29:15,615
Look in your heart.

429
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,159
It's just that I have no money to give you.

430
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,177
Arturo, for our daughter.

431
00:29:21,988 --> 00:29:23,139
I beg of you.

432
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:26,534
Fine, look. I'll see if I can
work something out.

433
00:29:27,578 --> 00:29:28,317
Sit.

434
00:29:28,862 --> 00:29:29,890
Sit down.

435
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,156
Don't be that way.

436
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:36,026
At 5:00 sharp I'll be back to get you.

437
00:29:36,146 --> 00:29:37,965
Don't move. 5:00 sharp.

438
00:29:47,177 --> 00:29:49,926
You're late. The train leaves at 5:15.

439
00:29:50,046 --> 00:29:52,615
- I'm sorry.
- We had better not miss it.

440
00:30:09,692 --> 00:30:10,756
You're back?

441
00:30:11,077 --> 00:30:14,536
I got tired of waiting.
It's past 5:00 and he hasn't returned.

442
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,995
Well don't fret. We have plenty to do here.

443
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:19,246
Come here.

444
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,656
Have a seat.

445
00:30:28,547 --> 00:30:30,756
- And what's your name?
- Tiburcio.

446
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:33,124
- What an ugly name.
- It is ugly...

447
00:30:33,244 --> 00:30:36,957
but it's the best out of
three ways to say it...

448
00:30:37,489 --> 00:30:40,901
Tiburcio, Tribulcio, and Tirburfio.

449
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,977
- And why are you locked up?
- For nothing.

450
00:30:45,456 --> 00:30:47,282
For a meal I didn't eat.

451
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:52,037
A little chicken. A little rice.

452
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,188
- What can I say? I was full.
- You.

453
00:30:55,308 --> 00:30:57,859
I have orders to put you
back with the others.

454
00:30:58,542 --> 00:30:59,505
Really?

455
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,819
But this doesn't mean I've forgotten.

456
00:31:01,939 --> 00:31:03,813
Yes, sir.

457
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:07,494
How did this happen?

458
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,786
The medic didn't want to be
responsible for you.

459
00:31:11,051 --> 00:31:14,553
I'm starting to think I'm the rooster
of the regiment.

460
00:31:19,317 --> 00:31:24,290
But when we get back to the city they're
going to take you off patrol for 30 days.

461
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,317
A month closer to being home.

462
00:31:26,702 --> 00:31:31,790
- Is this true? 30 days? They already decided?
- That's what they said.

463
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:35,200
We'll miss you of course.

464
00:31:35,658 --> 00:31:38,982
- If I were captain...
- What would you do?

465
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:40,253
Me?

466
00:31:47,312 --> 00:31:51,010
If I were the captain

467
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:54,131
There are many things I would change

468
00:31:54,777 --> 00:32:00,785
And if I had half a chance
I would make things easier for all of us

469
00:32:01,894 --> 00:32:05,186
We'd each have golden belts
around our waists

470
00:32:05,306 --> 00:32:08,965
But not to wear because
they'd weigh us down

471
00:32:09,313 --> 00:32:12,930
We'd have all of the
leave days that we wanted

472
00:32:13,217 --> 00:32:16,525
And all the girls we'd ever want around

473
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,035
He wanted to be the captain

474
00:32:20,631 --> 00:32:23,700
He would have been a good one for us

475
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:27,544
If I were the captain

476
00:32:27,664 --> 00:32:30,722
I would be a tremendous one

477
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:34,409
And a great captain to the ladies as well

478
00:32:34,847 --> 00:32:38,480
I'd treat blondes, brunettes,
and the rest equally

479
00:32:38,892 --> 00:32:42,298
And if ever a one was in need

480
00:32:42,751 --> 00:32:46,027
I would drop everything to attend to her

481
00:32:46,302 --> 00:32:49,838
If I were captain

482
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:53,541
I would really break the mold

483
00:33:05,695 --> 00:33:09,311
If he were captain

484
00:33:09,603 --> 00:33:12,985
There are many things he would improve

485
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:16,534
And if he had half a chance

486
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:20,329
He would make things
much better for all of us

487
00:33:20,604 --> 00:33:24,187
I'd get rid of all the paperwork

488
00:33:24,307 --> 00:33:27,868
Not to mention all the other work

489
00:33:28,151 --> 00:33:31,735
If I were captain

490
00:33:31,855 --> 00:33:35,335
I'd have the happiest troop in the land

491
00:33:39,704 --> 00:33:43,304
Oh, you'd really all be lucky

492
00:33:47,034 --> 00:33:48,412
If I were captain

493
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,728
We would feast the whole day long

494
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:14,089
What's going on?

495
00:34:18,873 --> 00:34:20,196
Let me tell you.

496
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,194
This child has been disgraced.

497
00:34:23,314 --> 00:34:26,391
The father has abandoned them both.

498
00:34:27,206 --> 00:34:30,927
- Well?
- Angelillo, my heart goes out to them.

499
00:34:31,047 --> 00:34:35,406
- We have to take care of them.
- Then you should. If only I could help.

500
00:34:35,781 --> 00:34:40,322
- But you seem to have it under control.
- You can. Give me the 10 I didn't charge earlier.

501
00:34:41,148 --> 00:34:42,906
Come on. Give us the money.

502
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,530
All right. But hold on.

503
00:34:46,029 --> 00:34:48,121
I'm keeping it in the bank.

504
00:34:55,654 --> 00:34:59,465
This should do. Don't fret.
We'll take care of everything.

505
00:34:59,768 --> 00:35:01,941
You watch the child while we're out.

506
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:05,233
You're a saint.

507
00:35:05,622 --> 00:35:06,418
Go on.

508
00:35:06,822 --> 00:35:12,239
Who would have thought one minute ago that
I'd have traded 10 pesos for a baby?

509
00:35:12,589 --> 00:35:14,795
- But this is too much, really.
- Please.

510
00:35:15,427 --> 00:35:16,774
Think of the baby.

511
00:35:17,292 --> 00:35:21,493
If I didn't help you I couldn't live with
myself so please just allow me this.

512
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,699
We're leaving.

513
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:30,641
Listen, child.

514
00:35:30,974 --> 00:35:35,222
I don't know how your mother ran things
but tomorrow we're going to have to take...

515
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,752
a good look at your grasp of hygiene.

516
00:35:40,003 --> 00:35:43,110
He will give you a place to
stay for the next five days.

517
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,719
He'll provide food and any other basic needs.

518
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,235
- It's really nothing.
- Now child...

519
00:35:50,355 --> 00:35:54,321
if he gets a hug, the capitalist
in me has to ask.

520
00:35:54,796 --> 00:35:58,787
Give me a little kiss so I can
get my 10 pesos worth.

521
00:36:01,061 --> 00:36:02,407
She kissed me.

522
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:04,593
I think she kissed me.

523
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:08,078
Any chance 2 pesos more will buy
a kiss from you?

524
00:36:08,198 --> 00:36:09,885
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

525
00:36:10,005 --> 00:36:11,149
Come on.

526
00:36:14,895 --> 00:36:15,964
Let's walk.

527
00:36:21,761 --> 00:36:25,919
Where are you going to get the
money to keep all this up?

528
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,438
Tonight we'll put on a concert
and charge admission.

529
00:36:29,697 --> 00:36:33,219
- And if they won't pay?
- They will when they know what it's for.

530
00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:34,905
I'll help sell tickets.

531
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:37,626
We may even make extra that
you can send home.

532
00:36:37,746 --> 00:36:40,237
- How much do you think?
- I don't know.

533
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:43,701
But don't forget the main
reason we are doing this.

534
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,399
But no one else knows her.

535
00:36:46,933 --> 00:36:49,945
- People always give lots to charities.
- They do?

536
00:36:51,064 --> 00:36:52,993
I don't know. I guess so.

537
00:36:53,446 --> 00:36:55,197
I like the sound of that.

538
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,780
Thank you, all of you. You're too kind.

539
00:41:18,472 --> 00:41:24,015
He looks like a simple soldier but inside
beats the heart of a natural singer.

540
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:30,003
Wherever he goes he moves people to
observe the law but he moves mountains...

541
00:41:30,123 --> 00:41:33,418
with his voice. You've seen it here first.

542
00:41:43,004 --> 00:41:47,497
- How can I ever repay you?
- Really, there is nothing to repay.

543
00:41:47,617 --> 00:41:54,031
It took hardly any work at all.
He sings and the money just starts flowing.

544
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:58,921
- He sings and I collect.
- We'll put you up now in a shoeshine shop.

545
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:02,642
- You can make enough there to get by.
- Easy living from now on.

546
00:42:02,762 --> 00:42:06,296
We'll keep looking after you.
And if my singing continues to go well...

547
00:42:06,759 --> 00:42:12,052
- we'll see what else we can provide for you.
- Riches beyond your wildest dreams. You'll see.

548
00:42:12,172 --> 00:42:13,925
You're so good to me!

549
00:42:29,324 --> 00:42:30,841
And your change.

550
00:42:30,961 --> 00:42:33,182
Thanks for coming. Be well.

551
00:42:35,518 --> 00:42:37,617
- Good morning.
- That it is.

552
00:42:42,151 --> 00:42:43,912
- Want a shine?
- Yes.

553
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,888
- This place is new, isn't it?
- Brand new.

554
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,570
Me and two friends started it up.

555
00:42:57,323 --> 00:43:00,489
They run the business end.
I shine the shoes.

556
00:43:03,118 --> 00:43:05,240
- Goodness me.
- What was that?

557
00:43:05,729 --> 00:43:09,556
- Want I should clean them to a shine?
- But sir, they're so old.

558
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:10,916
Sorry.

559
00:43:12,295 --> 00:43:14,841
It's just that certain things...

560
00:43:15,603 --> 00:43:18,716
require patience to bring
out their natural zing.

561
00:43:19,995 --> 00:43:22,476
But sir, I don't have all day.

562
00:43:22,596 --> 00:43:25,298
Don't worry. You'll hardly notice.

563
00:43:26,195 --> 00:43:30,459
If you'll pardon my curiosity,
was your father anything like me?

564
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,791
- Curiosity in a shoeshiner is understandable.
- You're too kind.

565
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:36,914
The other one.

566
00:43:37,034 --> 00:43:38,494
The other one, I said.

567
00:43:39,337 --> 00:43:41,017
My goodness, what legs.

568
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,634
A shame you don't have more than two.

569
00:43:51,398 --> 00:43:53,344
Are you the one in charge?

570
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,717
I just work here.

571
00:43:54,837 --> 00:43:55,956
But tell me...

572
00:43:56,076 --> 00:43:59,111
- Can I get you something?
- A pack of cigarettes.

573
00:43:59,231 --> 00:44:01,113
Let me see what I have.

574
00:44:02,555 --> 00:44:04,826
There might be some in the other room.

575
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:07,452
Noticed how she's behaving?

576
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:10,809
- There's a sadness about her.
- A girl that pretty...

577
00:44:10,929 --> 00:44:12,861
- I found some.
- Brilliant.

578
00:44:13,134 --> 00:44:17,665
Now it's my turn. Tell us how a girl as
pretty as you gets mixed up with a guy...

579
00:44:17,785 --> 00:44:22,644
a captain, let's say, who has his hand
in every raw deal that goes on in this town.

580
00:44:22,764 --> 00:44:25,407
Enough. Either buy something else or leave.

581
00:44:25,527 --> 00:44:29,969
Now now, calm down. We'll leave you for
now and be back another day...

582
00:44:30,259 --> 00:44:31,744
to buy something else.

583
00:44:35,117 --> 00:44:36,285
Candelita.

584
00:44:37,282 --> 00:44:39,795
Candelita, get this woman's change.

585
00:44:39,915 --> 00:44:43,433
- What did she have?
- The works. She practically broke the bank.

586
00:44:47,439 --> 00:44:49,697
40 pesos, and 60.

587
00:44:51,995 --> 00:44:53,666
You're 10 short, child.

588
00:44:53,786 --> 00:44:57,519
- Oh, yes. You're right.
- The bookkeeper has made a mistake.

589
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,841
- Your best candy, please.
- How much you got?

590
00:45:11,961 --> 00:45:12,993
10 pesos.

591
00:45:13,399 --> 00:45:16,009
- No deal.
- Fine. How about a fruit bar?

592
00:45:16,269 --> 00:45:17,681
For you, certainly.

593
00:45:23,578 --> 00:45:24,662
What is this?

594
00:45:24,957 --> 00:45:27,175
- Chocolate.
- Chocolate?

595
00:45:28,074 --> 00:45:31,683
- Forget it.
- Perhaps you need to be more realistic.

596
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:33,751
How's this?

597
00:45:34,138 --> 00:45:36,149
Everyone walks all over me.

598
00:45:45,832 --> 00:45:47,176
Hey, Tiburcio.

599
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:53,355
- Did Angelillo say he'd be coming?
- How's he not going to come and see...

600
00:45:53,475 --> 00:45:56,274
- his two favorite girls in the world?
- Oh, good.

601
00:45:56,665 --> 00:45:58,563
He likes me even more than you?

602
00:45:58,683 --> 00:46:01,806
That's a lie. You're the one that doesn't like me.

603
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:05,087
But...I didn't mean to say it like that.

604
00:46:05,207 --> 00:46:09,474
Look at me, a girl so young and
already breaking hearts.

605
00:46:11,044 --> 00:46:14,193
My, the words that come out of your mouth.
Give us a kiss.

606
00:46:15,365 --> 00:46:18,161
Oh, I can't wait to see Angelillo.

607
00:46:22,184 --> 00:46:24,211
This is the shop where she works.

608
00:46:25,006 --> 00:46:26,554
She should be here now.

609
00:46:26,919 --> 00:46:28,921
- Are you sure?
- Of course I am.

610
00:46:31,251 --> 00:46:32,321
Candelas.

611
00:46:33,392 --> 00:46:34,316
Arturo.

612
00:46:35,256 --> 00:46:36,262
Excuse me.

613
00:46:38,273 --> 00:46:40,476
I don't mean to complicate your life.

614
00:46:40,786 --> 00:46:41,919
Are you calm?

615
00:46:44,659 --> 00:46:45,665
I'm calm.

616
00:46:46,573 --> 00:46:48,195
What do you want from me?

617
00:46:49,346 --> 00:46:52,398
I wouldn't be surprised if you
threw me to the curb.

618
00:46:53,392 --> 00:46:56,686
Perhaps that's my punishment
for the crime I've done you.

619
00:46:57,437 --> 00:46:58,519
God knows.

620
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:02,281
I need to speak with you.

621
00:47:03,372 --> 00:47:04,536
About what?

622
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,174
Seeing my daughter is in
both of our interests.

623
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,055
Where is she?

624
00:47:12,126 --> 00:47:14,640
- I can't let you see her.
- But you have to.

625
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,061
I can make things difficult
for you, you know?

626
00:47:20,131 --> 00:47:24,523
- You said you wouldn't complicate my life.
- Fine. But I must see her soon. When can I?

627
00:47:26,518 --> 00:47:27,818
I'll...let you know.

628
00:47:27,938 --> 00:47:30,283
- I give you my word.
- I'll be waiting.

629
00:47:38,071 --> 00:47:40,639
- You were with her?
- Yes. You have to leave?

630
00:47:40,898 --> 00:47:44,183
What do we do? I don't want
her to have to deal with this.

631
00:47:44,303 --> 00:47:45,924
She shouldn't have to.

632
00:47:46,769 --> 00:47:48,936
- What will we say?
- I don't know...

633
00:47:49,056 --> 00:47:52,617
- Angelillo will know what to do.
- What if I'm meant to be with him?

634
00:47:52,737 --> 00:47:54,322
No. I doubt that.

635
00:47:54,755 --> 00:47:56,942
- I swear that...
- Please, quiet.

636
00:47:58,462 --> 00:48:00,275
My life has been a disaster.

637
00:48:00,781 --> 00:48:03,068
And the worst is having abandoned you.

638
00:48:03,188 --> 00:48:06,843
Everything else in my life, my business,
is falling apart as a result.

639
00:48:07,209 --> 00:48:09,172
And now look at me. I'm miserable.

640
00:48:09,836 --> 00:48:10,666
Arturo.

641
00:48:11,085 --> 00:48:14,665
And all the while, all I can think of
is how I must have hurt you.

642
00:48:14,785 --> 00:48:16,399
You've got that right.

643
00:48:17,072 --> 00:48:18,288
I was a coward.

644
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:20,137
I realize now.

645
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,608
- But this never occurred to you before?
- It pains me now to think...

646
00:48:24,728 --> 00:48:28,857
that when our daughter becomes a woman
she may want nothing to do with me.

647
00:48:29,442 --> 00:48:30,852
It's getting late.

648
00:48:31,488 --> 00:48:33,385
Please let me see her.

649
00:48:34,196 --> 00:48:37,131
And what about this man that
has been so good to me?

650
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:41,963
You will have to choose between your
womanly selfishness and your duty as a mother.

651
00:48:47,553 --> 00:48:49,869
I don't know what I'm going to do.

652
00:48:49,989 --> 00:48:53,022
Candelas, you can't share
any of this with anyone.

653
00:48:53,142 --> 00:48:57,483
- He promised to take care of my daughter.
- Don't believe him. It's all a trick.

654
00:48:57,745 --> 00:49:00,729
- I don't know. He was crying.
- That means nothing.

655
00:49:00,981 --> 00:49:03,917
All that thug can muster
are crocodile tears.

656
00:49:04,435 --> 00:49:08,729
Not to mention, could you leave
Angelillo to be with that man?

657
00:49:09,009 --> 00:49:10,274
Of course not.

658
00:49:11,231 --> 00:49:15,771
How bittersweet to be loved by two men.
When he returns I'll take care of him.

659
00:49:15,891 --> 00:49:23,045
- No. Give me a few days to figure this out.
- Give me a few days to prove he is a criminal.

660
00:49:23,165 --> 00:49:25,173
- Let's hope.
- Fine then.

661
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,551
THE PERFECT DETECTIVE'S MANUAL

662
00:49:39,417 --> 00:49:40,497
Step one.

663
00:49:41,006 --> 00:49:43,791
Well, getting the book was step one.
Step two.

664
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:48,728
Learn to shadow your mark so he
doesn't know he's being followed.

665
00:49:50,602 --> 00:49:51,769
Step three.

666
00:49:53,325 --> 00:50:00,174
Find out what your mark is doing wrong
so you can catch him in the act.

667
00:50:02,452 --> 00:50:03,563
I'm a natural.

668
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:07,697
Anyone who looks on me
can see a real detective.

669
00:50:18,547 --> 00:50:22,844
Scoundrel, I will get to the bottom
of your nefarious plan.

670
00:50:23,492 --> 00:50:25,634
Who are you talking to?

671
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:28,683
I speak to a scoundrel.

672
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:34,424
- I'm done here.
- You're done.

673
00:50:34,878 --> 00:50:37,354
Not quite right in the head, that one.

674
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:51,438
What do you need?

675
00:50:52,022 --> 00:50:55,915
I need to see your file
for Arturo Castellano.

676
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,229
Excuse my cough.

677
00:50:59,488 --> 00:51:01,685
I assume you have clearance to see it.

678
00:51:02,155 --> 00:51:04,712
- What's the name again?
- Arturo Castellano.

679
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:19,097
Right at the top.

680
00:51:19,484 --> 00:51:21,251
Robbery, forgery...

681
00:51:21,371 --> 00:51:22,857
- Nothing else?
- No.

682
00:51:23,116 --> 00:51:26,992
Could you give me an official certificate
that attests to this man's crimes?

683
00:51:27,112 --> 00:51:31,467
There's no such thing. Besides, I couldn't
just hand something like that out to anyone.

684
00:51:31,587 --> 00:51:36,148
Huh. So you can issue a certificate for
good conduct but not bad. How odd.

685
00:51:37,037 --> 00:51:38,962
Thank you for your time.

686
00:51:57,829 --> 00:51:59,810
You? What are you doing here?

687
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:04,434
- I was waiting forever for you to come out.
- I haven't had a chance to leave.

688
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:08,415
- I just want to see my daughter.
- Angelillo could be back any moment.

689
00:52:08,535 --> 00:52:11,820
What does that matter to me?
Let me see her.

690
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:16,835
Fine, wait. You can say hello quickly
but then you must leave.

691
00:53:07,525 --> 00:53:08,498
Greetings!

692
00:53:08,823 --> 00:53:09,812
Angelillo.

693
00:53:10,144 --> 00:53:12,552
- But when did you arrive?
- Just now.

694
00:53:12,901 --> 00:53:14,799
- And Candelas?
- She's well.

695
00:53:14,919 --> 00:53:16,907
Very well. Well enough at least.

696
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,182
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.

697
00:53:19,817 --> 00:53:22,039
Nothing's going on. It's just that...

698
00:53:23,401 --> 00:53:25,396
When did you start smoking a pipe?

699
00:53:25,516 --> 00:53:30,206
You shouldn't be alarmed. There's a reason
for it, but nothing to be alarmed about.

700
00:53:30,326 --> 00:53:32,230
You're acting strange Tiburcio.

701
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,922
You're nervous, reserved.

702
00:53:35,902 --> 00:53:38,642
- Are you hiding something from me?
- Who, me?

703
00:53:38,762 --> 00:53:40,043
What a thought!

704
00:53:40,443 --> 00:53:42,512
Hey, why don't we go for a walk?

705
00:53:42,632 --> 00:53:44,211
- Come on.
- No.

706
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:47,892
I'm going to see Candelas.

707
00:53:52,758 --> 00:53:53,439
No.

708
00:53:53,978 --> 00:53:56,362
- Just wait a bit.
- No, now!

709
00:53:56,482 --> 00:53:59,897
She's not ready Angelillo. Let me
go up and see when she will be.

710
00:54:00,017 --> 00:54:02,334
- Why can't I go up myself?
- Because...

711
00:54:02,454 --> 00:54:05,861
- she's not there.
- Tell the truth Tiburcio. Where is she?

712
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:07,276
What's going on?

713
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:09,336
What's happened to Candelas?

714
00:54:09,456 --> 00:54:11,399
Please, one question at a time.

715
00:54:11,853 --> 00:54:14,838
You're really overreacting. You'll see.

716
00:54:15,183 --> 00:54:17,843
This is funny to you?
How can you laugh at this?

717
00:54:18,325 --> 00:54:20,311
- Let me upstairs!
- I can't!

718
00:54:28,055 --> 00:54:32,804
- Where is your mother?
- In the laundry room with a very mean man.

719
00:54:32,924 --> 00:54:34,304
I'll show you.

720
00:54:43,466 --> 00:54:44,634
There there.

721
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:03,566
- Where are you going Angelillo?
- Now I know how she really feels.

722
00:55:03,686 --> 00:55:04,635
Good bye.

723
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:10,615
- You aren't going to leave me with a kiss?
- Yes, of course.

724
00:55:14,617 --> 00:55:17,571
- Only one?
- It's worth more that way.

725
00:55:39,025 --> 00:55:40,138
Good bye.

726
00:55:40,258 --> 00:55:41,828
I've seen all I need to.

727
00:55:41,948 --> 00:55:42,832
You saw?

728
00:55:42,952 --> 00:55:45,485
I'm no longer the prisoner
of a woman's heart.

729
00:55:45,605 --> 00:55:49,138
- Don't be that way. I'll explain everything.
- I know what I saw.

730
00:55:49,258 --> 00:55:52,277
- Candelas has betrayed me.
- Please, don't attack me.

731
00:55:52,397 --> 00:55:54,467
If nothing else, I still like you.

732
00:55:54,587 --> 00:55:56,958
- Allow me to explain.
- It's too late.

733
00:55:57,078 --> 00:56:01,173
This is how she repays me for all I've done?
I never want to see her again.

734
00:56:01,293 --> 00:56:06,053
Angelillo, don't leave. At least wait
until we know everything.

735
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,689
What's wrong? You're hardly here.

736
00:56:11,078 --> 00:56:13,656
I don't know.
This whole thing makes me sick.

737
00:56:13,776 --> 00:56:16,284
Well it's too late to turn back now.

738
00:56:16,404 --> 00:56:19,121
In just 20 days we'll be in Buenos Aires.

739
00:56:19,241 --> 00:56:22,824
- Can you tango?
- We'll have plenty time to learn.

740
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:24,884
Honestly, stop worrying.

741
00:56:25,726 --> 00:56:27,800
If I'm lucky they'll kill me.

742
00:56:53,121 --> 00:56:55,304
- What will you have, sir?
- A glass.

743
00:56:55,424 --> 00:56:56,851
- Sorry?
- A beer.

744
00:57:04,097 --> 00:57:10,495
The woman is the key to discovering the
scoundrel's true intentions.

745
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:18,683
Seduce her, make her take interest, then shake
her up and get the information you need.

746
00:57:29,264 --> 00:57:30,342
Excuse me.

747
00:57:30,726 --> 00:57:34,910
There's a bit of a draft over there
and since I'm a little bit...

748
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:37,575
- Asthmatic?
- No, just a little cold.

749
00:57:38,299 --> 00:57:39,408
Do you mind?

750
00:57:39,928 --> 00:57:42,281
A gentleman is never a bother.

751
00:57:42,594 --> 00:57:44,615
- Nor a true lady.
- Thank you.

752
00:57:44,735 --> 00:57:47,260
Very good then.
Now that that's settled...

753
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:51,282
Would you be offended if I
offered to buy you a drink?

754
00:57:52,725 --> 00:57:58,062
My, you certainly come on strong but
I wouldn't be offended in the least.

755
00:57:58,804 --> 00:58:01,375
I learned long ago never
to turn away a gift.

756
00:58:01,495 --> 00:58:04,976
I knew I would like you from
the moment I saw you.

757
00:58:06,124 --> 00:58:07,745
- Waiter.
- Yes, sir.

758
00:58:07,865 --> 00:58:12,513
Two of your finest cured hams and
a bottle of sherry for me and the lady.

759
00:58:12,633 --> 00:58:13,635
Yes, sir.

760
00:58:13,755 --> 00:58:16,220
Only the best for the two of us.

761
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,435
Naturally.

762
00:58:22,453 --> 00:58:26,021
My lady, I must ask, even if it's impolite...

763
00:58:26,692 --> 00:58:30,260
the man that was with you earlier,
was he your father?

764
00:58:30,612 --> 00:58:33,677
He's a cousin. He was running
late and had to leave.

765
00:58:34,099 --> 00:58:35,194
Did he have far to go?

766
00:58:35,314 --> 00:58:37,584
That wasn't any of my business.

767
00:58:38,294 --> 00:58:40,419
And you, what's your story?

768
00:58:40,735 --> 00:58:44,408
I'm a pearl diver. That's actually
what drew me to you.

769
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,239
A pearl on land.

770
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,064
- Only mine should have tomatoes.
- I asked for it too.

771
00:58:50,184 --> 00:58:53,525
- You're a mad hatter.
- Between us I think we have enough hats.

772
00:58:53,645 --> 00:58:56,185
- What was that?
- Nothing, I like your hat.

773
00:58:57,204 --> 00:59:00,185
Can I also order one of those
fancy rolls with mayo?

774
00:59:00,464 --> 00:59:02,604
- How is it?
- Marvelous.

775
00:59:02,724 --> 00:59:05,516
I'm glad I picked this table to eat at.

776
00:59:41,002 --> 00:59:42,624
My dear friend Angelillo...

777
00:59:42,744 --> 00:59:46,321
I forgive you for the insults that
you have seen fit to hurl at me...

778
00:59:46,441 --> 00:59:50,639
and for the difficult situation
that you have put me in...

779
00:59:50,759 --> 00:59:54,677
but I cannot live with being
thought of as a traitor.

780
00:59:54,797 --> 00:59:59,270
Meet me at the shop tonight at 11:00 and I
will share with you some vital information...

781
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:02,081
that I have discovered through
my detective work.

782
01:00:02,201 --> 01:00:04,575
You must know that you can trust Candelas.

783
01:00:04,695 --> 01:00:07,941
She is a strong woman but has been
manipulated by a scoundrel.

784
01:00:08,061 --> 01:00:11,183
If you do not wish to meet,
I will not contact you again...

785
01:00:11,303 --> 01:00:14,337
though I remain your friend,
even if we never meet again.

786
01:00:14,457 --> 01:00:15,651
Tiburcio Canales

787
01:00:15,771 --> 01:00:17,790
This key will let you in the shop.

788
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:20,419
- Who brought this?
- I'll inquire.

789
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:24,127
Meet me at the shop tonight at 11:00.

790
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:35,327
- What time is it?
- 10:15.

791
01:00:35,677 --> 01:00:38,775
- Get my bags and meet me outside.
- Is something wrong?

792
01:00:38,895 --> 01:00:39,946
No, nothing.

793
01:00:43,107 --> 01:00:44,988
SHOESHINE

794
01:02:25,413 --> 01:02:26,386
Tiburcio.

795
01:02:29,386 --> 01:02:30,094
You?

796
01:02:33,944 --> 01:02:36,034
It always is. What's going on?

797
01:02:36,154 --> 01:02:38,917
First you steal Candelas.
Then you steal from her.

798
01:02:39,037 --> 01:02:41,990
- I didn't break in. She gave me a key.
- Liar.

799
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:44,468
- She did, because she loves me.
- Never!

800
01:03:28,786 --> 01:03:29,426
No!

801
01:04:15,203 --> 01:04:16,728
No, it can't be!

802
01:04:19,744 --> 01:04:21,982
Not our shop! It's my fault!

803
01:04:57,992 --> 01:05:01,897
Last night, the shop at 147 Argumosa St
fell victim to a candlelight robbery.

804
01:05:02,017 --> 01:05:04,920
The shop's owner was present
when the crime occurred.

805
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:09,017
Authorities report that a fight broke out
between the owner and the assailant.

806
01:05:09,137 --> 01:05:13,351
In the ensuing melee, the assailants
candle is believed to have started the fire...

807
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:16,746
when it made contact with a pool
of gasoline on the premises.

808
01:05:16,866 --> 01:05:20,784
The flames spread quickly and left the
assailant the victim of his own crime.

809
01:05:24,704 --> 01:05:26,293
Why are you crying?

810
01:05:28,369 --> 01:05:30,496
You couldn't possibly understand.

811
01:05:30,943 --> 01:05:33,051
That man has wronged us terribly.

812
01:05:33,171 --> 01:05:36,440
But what does it matter
if we still have Angelillo?

813
01:05:37,673 --> 01:05:39,223
But we don't anymore.

814
01:05:39,611 --> 01:05:40,536
He left?

815
01:05:42,181 --> 01:05:43,040
Yes.

816
01:05:43,337 --> 01:05:44,859
And Tiburcio too?

817
01:05:45,785 --> 01:05:48,179
Tiburcio hasn't left yet, but is about to.

818
01:05:48,299 --> 01:05:51,842
- Please, don't you abandon us too.
- I have to. I have failed.

819
01:05:51,962 --> 01:05:54,706
As a friend because Angelillo
thinks me a traitor.

820
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:58,455
And as a detective because I lost my mark
and almost let him rob you.

821
01:05:58,575 --> 01:05:59,574
I quit.

822
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:03,574
I broke my magnifying glass to pieces
and threw the manual in the fire.

823
01:06:03,694 --> 01:06:05,813
I'm a brute and I have to leave.

824
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,072
- Where to?
- Home.

825
01:06:08,192 --> 01:06:10,355
And why did you become a brute?

826
01:06:10,614 --> 01:06:14,104
I don't know, but now that I am
I should get out of your way.

827
01:06:14,992 --> 01:06:19,843
Here is a letter from Angelillo. I wasn't going
to show you it but it doesn't matter now.

828
01:06:22,994 --> 01:06:24,016
Candelas

829
01:06:24,136 --> 01:06:26,416
I am leaving Spain forever.

830
01:06:26,536 --> 01:06:29,546
I forgive you for paying me so poorly.

831
01:06:29,666 --> 01:06:30,713
Good bye.

832
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:31,658
Angel

833
01:06:32,497 --> 01:06:35,323
What in God's name have I done to
deserve this?

834
01:06:35,985 --> 01:06:37,704
This is the Devil's doing.

835
01:06:39,212 --> 01:06:41,288
Tiburcio, we have to find him.

836
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:44,508
But he's left Madrid without saying
where to find him.

837
01:06:44,628 --> 01:06:45,822
I'll find him.

838
01:06:47,975 --> 01:06:49,727
THE FINAL SHOW OF
ANGELILLO

839
01:06:49,847 --> 01:06:51,510
THE ANDALUCIAN NIGHTINGALE

840
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:54,198
The farewell show from
the king of flamenco...

841
01:06:54,318 --> 01:06:57,263
before embarking on a sold-out
tour of South America.

842
01:06:58,002 --> 01:07:01,792
- What do you think?
- It's a nice boat. Such a shame though.

843
01:07:01,912 --> 01:07:03,917
- Why?
- Because you're leaving.

844
01:07:04,037 --> 01:07:07,906
- I wish you would bomb tonight and call it off.
- I'd leave either way.

845
01:07:08,026 --> 01:07:11,602
In that case I wish you as much success
in your travels as you have had here.

846
01:07:11,722 --> 01:07:14,496
I know what I'm doing. I can't stay here.

847
01:07:15,735 --> 01:07:17,415
I'm leaving for good.

848
01:07:18,346 --> 01:07:21,696
These are personal issues.
Let's not speak of them anymore.

849
01:07:56,606 --> 01:07:58,983
Where do you think you're going?

850
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:01,988
I've come to see Angelillo. Is he here?

851
01:08:02,108 --> 01:08:05,768
- What? Do you just want an autograph?
- An autograph? I know the guy.

852
01:08:05,888 --> 01:08:07,300
We go way back.

853
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:10,854
I see. Head that way, make a right,
and then a left.

854
01:08:18,242 --> 01:08:19,241
Tiburcio.

855
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:20,800
We need to talk.

856
01:08:21,167 --> 01:08:23,415
I'm going to tell you everything.

857
01:08:23,707 --> 01:08:26,443
That's not necessary.
I know I was wrong.

858
01:08:26,563 --> 01:08:29,119
This isn't about me. It's about Candelas.

859
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:31,593
- That's what I meant.
- Of course it is.

860
01:08:31,713 --> 01:08:36,132
- I'm just the lowly shoeshine man.
- Tiburcio, we're square.

861
01:08:36,252 --> 01:08:39,634
Tiburcio nothing. Candelas has always
been faithful to you.

862
01:08:40,007 --> 01:08:44,127
That man pursued her relentlessly with
the intent to harm her.

863
01:08:44,247 --> 01:08:46,917
She came to me for advice and I gave it.

864
01:08:47,037 --> 01:08:48,857
We didn't want to worry you.

865
01:08:48,977 --> 01:08:53,757
- Then why did she give him a key?
- The police found that his key was forged.

866
01:08:54,043 --> 01:08:56,141
Angelillo, they need you.

867
01:08:59,035 --> 01:09:01,030
Sorry, I've no more time to talk.

868
01:09:01,432 --> 01:09:05,790
Any man who abandons a woman who loves
him without motive is a wretch.

869
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:08,018
- Sure.
- You've always said that.

870
01:09:08,138 --> 01:09:09,699
- But...
- A wretch!

871
01:09:09,819 --> 01:09:11,765
- Yes, but I...
- A wretch!

872
01:09:12,661 --> 01:09:15,450
- It's time to go on.
- I don't want to go anymore.

873
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:19,511
- Are you crazy?
- No, I have a woman who loves me.

874
01:11:22,889 --> 01:11:25,296
- Forgive me.
- I already have.

875
01:11:25,416 --> 01:11:29,065
- I love you more than ever.
- I have always loved you.

876
01:11:29,185 --> 01:11:31,884
- Candelas.
- See, I told you so.

877
01:11:50,857 --> 01:11:54,260
Beloved audience.

878
01:11:56,093 --> 01:12:02,147
Angelillo is prepared to cancel his tour
and stay here on one condition.

879
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:06,941
That they never separate him from that
which can never be separated ever.

880
01:12:13,544 --> 01:12:17,310
And as that is all I have to say,
I leave you now...

881
01:12:17,602 --> 01:12:21,997
with the great gift of not having
to hear any more from me.

882
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:54,205
The love you find in the end
Is worth the fight to get it

883
01:12:54,325 --> 01:13:03,887
I can't imagine life without you in it

884
01:13:04,007 --> 01:13:12,702
Serving you until the very end

885
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:21,981
Love is the only thing that
gives meaning to it all

886
01:13:22,101 --> 01:13:28,090
I want to be happy in the end

887
01:13:34,783 --> 01:13:36,481
