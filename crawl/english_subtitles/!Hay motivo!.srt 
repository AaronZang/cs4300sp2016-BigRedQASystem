ONE MONTH BEFORE

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,909
THE GENERAL ELECTION
IN MARCH 2004,

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,119
A GROUP OF FILMMAKERS
DECIDED TO MAKE A FILM

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,199
ABOUT CERTAIN ASPECTS
OF SPANISH SOCIETY.

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,110
WE QUICKLY MADE
32 SHORT FILMS

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,078
WHICH WERE SHOWN
PRIOR TO THE ELECTION.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,635
GIVEN THE SPECIAL
CIRCUMSTANCES,

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,791
WE LATER ADDED AN EPILOGUE.

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,352
- Where to?
- The communications tower.

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,318
- Spanish Television?
- That's right.

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,356
The things they said about the boss,
Udaci, on the radio this morning!

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,350
What did they say?

16
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,114
About his news programmes...

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,672
The thing is you can't prove
there's censorship or manipulation

18
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,752
because they don't
exactly tell us

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,195
what they want us to do,

20
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,272
but you get the point
and there are certain subjects...

21
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,238
- Perhaps I shouldn't ask but...
- That's okay. What?

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,391
Do you vote for the PP?

23
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,951
No. I'm just temporary. In 2 weeks'
time I'll be out on my ear again.

24
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,032
They just lie
to us all the time.

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,953
Yes, that's true.

26
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,357
I mean, I listen to the radio
but my mother

27
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,476
watches TV
and believes every word.

28
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,074
"Spanish TV unites
and divides us," right?

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,550
Last night I burned myself
when I was making the kids' supper

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,030
and just look at my hand.
But I can't get time off sick.

31
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,397
"Spain is fine."
Well I'm not fine at all.

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,949
And my husband's inside.

33
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,833
Your husband's in jail?

34
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,038
With today's laws? Sure.

35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,795
They catch you with enough dope
to make one joint and it's 3 years.

36
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,394
I'd need 3 lifetimes
to pay my house off.

37
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,233
Yet there are
"For Sale" signs everywhere.

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,833
- Yes.
- So who buys them?

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,356
A flat of 72,000 euros a couple
of years ago costs 180,000 now.

40
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,590
Flats have gone up 111%.

41
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,433
I've never seen
a 500 euro note in my life.

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,159
You ever seen one?

43
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,998
- 500?
- Never.

44
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,595
I know they're purple,
somebody told me.

45
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,990
And Zaplana
with his private plane.

46
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,230
It's hard enough
paying the babysitter.

47
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,476
- I know.
- I just can't manage.

48
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,269
An absolute majority and so many
people out of work. I don't get it.

49
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,591
Right-wing supporters
always go out and vote.

50
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,036
- They always vote.
- Yes, they do.

51
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,155
Yes.

52
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,276
You have to grant them that.

53
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,671
I mean, people complain
then don't bother to vote.

54
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,916
So they shouldn't complain.

55
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,911
On the radio the other day

56
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,868
they said that full-time jobs
have dropped by a million.

57
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,192
It's all temporary work nowadays.
All of it.

58
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,511
They were talking about
mobile phones on the radio.

59
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,877
The phone company's
made a fortune out of it.

60
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,754
A lot of people
have taken early retirement.

61
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,150
At 50 and under.

62
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,796
So who pays
their Social Security?

63
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,758
You and me and all Spaniards.

64
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,232
The only thing we're good at
is arms research.

65
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,670
Second only to the Americans.

66
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,989
- Really?
- Yes.

67
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,354
That's how stupid we are.

68
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,071
But you can't even go out
and demonstrate against the war.

69
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,118
You're "unpatriotic"
and they fine you.

70
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,317
That's where
the news manipulation comes in.

71
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,431
You can talk
about some things.

72
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,478
Things everybody talks about,
like Carod-Rovira.

73
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,278
Other things you can't.

74
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,991
What they say on the state
TV news, on Spanish Television,

75
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,991
is different
from private TV news.

76
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,230
That mayor
who abused that girl...

77
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,390
- Yes.
- Very nasty.

78
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,353
Then Fraga says
there's no reason...

79
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,317
- No reason?
...to fire him.

80
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,199
That it was all
probably very innocent.

81
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,670
It sounded just like
the old days with Franco.

82
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,509
Fraga must be tired of going around
eating octopus all the time.

83
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,592
He should retire
from politics and stay at home.

84
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,035
People are annoyed
with the socialists too.

85
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,753
They did some bad things too.

86
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,309
Nobody's perfect.

87
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,988
The PP wouldn't have
their majority otherwise.

88
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,309
Just too bad.

89
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,358
- Things change.
- For the worse, right?

90
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,910
My folks thought everything
was going to change.

91
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,594
I feel sorry
for people like them

92
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,395
who fought for change.
Now things are worse.

93
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,791
I don't think
jackets suit Zapatero.

94
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,996
Almost there now.

95
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,713
The ride's on me.

96
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,676
On you?

97
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,152
Things must be bad enough
for you just working at Spanish TV.

98
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,231
No, tell me what I owe you and...

99
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,833
Nice meeting you.

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,069
You too.

101
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,232
Watch my hand, it's sore.

102
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,356
Well, thanks.
I was just...

103
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,033
- Bye.
- Thanks a lot, eh?

104
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,316
That's okay.
Be seeing you.

105
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,114
THE WATER PLAN

106
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,199
The government's Water Distribution
Plan started outdated.

107
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,751
Based on the old strategy
applied to subsided cement,

108
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,718
it will flood villages
and populated valleys

109
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,599
and destroy areas
such as the Ebro delta,

110
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,672
our second greatest heritage
of biodiversity after Donòana,

111
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,831
in an area
with 50,000 people.

112
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,155
To expect those people to support
the plan would be demagogic.

113
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,595
How can they be expected

114
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,271
to abandon their villages
for the sake of the development

115
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,829
of projects like
the Terra Mitica theme park?

116
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,508
A clear distinction
should be made

117
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,877
between deficits
in human needs

118
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,919
and surpluses
in the greed of the richest.

119
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,991
On the Mediterranean coast
we now use and require an average

120
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,556
of over 3 tonnes of water
per capita per day,

121
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,836
much of this water

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,869
for farming or development projects
often bordering on the illegal.

123
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,232
Meanwhile the authorities
look the other way,

124
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,391
which encourages illegal acts.

125
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,988
There is a difference between water
as "life" and water as "business."

126
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,352
We must not violate human

127
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,590
or social rights

128
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,877
so that a few
can do good business.

129
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,430
And the plan is a bad business,
uneconomical for the country.

130
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,434
The government has failed
to specify how much

131
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,875
the citizens
will have to pay

132
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,998
in the remoter regions
of Murcia and Almeria

133
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,914
for the water brought to them.
Despite a 60% subsidy...

134
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,958
a non-refundable subsidy
of taxpayer's money...

135
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,237
these areas will have
to pay a higher price

136
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,949
than that now paid
to desalinate seawater.

137
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,988
And 35% of the country's
water is lost through leaks

138
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,516
in the urban networks
and over 50% is lost

139
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,037
in the obsolete irrigation system
used on 2 million hectares of land.

140
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,438
Modernization and an intelligent
use of the new technologies

141
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,309
are challenges for the modernization
of the water distribution system.

142
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,118
Also the challenge
of dialogue,

143
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,113
and of overcoming the dynamic
of confrontation

144
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,998
imposed upon us
by the government.

145
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,192
The new "water culture"

146
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,750
will require a fresh look
at our natural heritage.

147
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,436
We cannot go on looking at our
rivers as mere canals of H2O.

148
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,553
Just as we do not see our forests
as timber warehouses,

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,195
we must not see rivers
in the Pyrenees

150
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,635
as keys to the production
of yet more corn,

151
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,075
electricity
or urban speculation.

152
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,959
Just as we must not see
La Concha in San Sebastian

153
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,152
or Benidorm beach

154
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,834
as simply quarries
of sand for building.

155
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,595
To save the Mediterranean rivers
from speculation

156
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,878
and corruption is
the challenge to

157
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,948
this powerful citizers movement

165
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,028
THE NIGHTMARE

166
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,193
At last we arrived.

167
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,518
After weeks of flying.

168
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,277
Up in the sky, Daddy said,

169
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,429
"Remember that river, that lake,

170
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,071
that forest, where we stopped
to rest last year?" I remembered

171
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,879
but looking down,
I saw they had gone.

172
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,112
Doòana at last.

173
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,836
We arrived at night, exhausted.

174
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,675
I fell asleep right away,
happy to have reached paradise.

175
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,871
I've had a terrible nightmare.

176
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,997
I knew I was asleep,
I tried to wake up but couldn't.

177
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,792
In the nightmare paradise
was turning into hell.

178
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,599
I opened my eyes

179
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,034
and there was nobody there.

180
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,755
And the nightmare
swallowed me up.

181
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,594
ON 25 APRIL 1988,

182
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,035
THE AZNALCOLLAR MINE'S
WASTE RESERVOIR BROKE.

183

00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,033

DIED IN EUROPE'S RICHEST
ECOLOGICAL PRESERVE.

188
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,428
THE DAMAGE REMAINS,

189
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,909
THE LAWSUITS AND MUTAL
ACCUSATIONS CONTINUE.

190
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,514
WHEN WILL WE AWAKEN
FROM THE NIGHTMARE?

191
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,515
CLOSE YOUR EYES

192
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,915
Spain is the European country with
the most black money in circulation.

193
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,035
How much longer
will we close our eyes to it?

194
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,955
WHERE DO WE LIVE?

195
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,189

225
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,477
THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS
OF THE SHOPPING TROLLEY

226
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,715
I spend

227
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,795
all day here. I spend
a lot of time here. And...

228
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,199
I like watching the old men
playing bowls and all that.

229
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,194
Yeah, I like that.

230
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,591
I'm an observant kind
of guy, you know.

231
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,070
People say to me, "Hey, man,

232
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,754
you don't miss a trick."

233
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,269
And I say, "Yeah, that's true.
No, I don't miss a trick."

234
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,473
You know, nowadays
there's a whole lot of things

235
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,150
that kind of shock me.

236
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,275
Freak me out even.

237
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,510
The old ladies,
for instance...

238
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,235
Have you noticed

239
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,909
that they've all
got white hair now?

240
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,555
Hey, Teresa.
How you doing?

241
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,229
Coping.

242
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,515
- Coping?
- Yes.

243
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,989
Yeah, white hair and that's it.

244
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,111
No hairdresser's for them.

245
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,920
I mean, before,
on Fridays and Saturdays,

246
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,312
you'd see them
out in the street

247
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,199
with their hair
all tinted and looking

248
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,638
all smart, you know?

249
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,199
And then there's

250
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,949
the trolley thing.

251
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,476
They have their shopping trolleys
but they don't buy anything.

252
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,469
I mean, what can they buy
with 200 euros?

253
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,672
Their shopping trolleys
get emptier and emptier.

254
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,469
I mean, you go to the market
and tomatoes are 7 euros a kilo.

255
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,835
That's more than
1,000 old pesetas.

256
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,753
I mean 7 euros is 1,200 pesetas.

257
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,469
Remember howfar
1,200 pesetas used to go?

258
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,519
I mean, you need a kilo of tomatoes
just to stick on spaghetti.

259
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,272
In some supermarkets

260
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,715
they charge you for the bag.

261
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,235
Like 5 cents for a fucking bag!

262
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,913
I used to like going

263
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,548
and helping them
up the stairs...

264
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,351
You'd think we were living

265
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,875
in Japan or something.

266
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,189
I feel really sorry for them.

267
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,634
Really sorry.

268
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,480
I used to like helping them

269
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,756
and taking their trolleys up.

270
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,798
It used to make me feel good.

271
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,234
Silly, ain't it?

272
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,788
3 OUT OF 4 PENSIONS
ARE UNDER 600 EUROS A MONTH.

273
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,474
800,000 WOMEN DRAW
LESS THAN 400 EUROS A MONTH.

274
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,039
THE PENSION INCREASES
APPROVED

275
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,633
BY THE GOVERNMENT
LAST YEAR

276
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,839
EXCLUDED 74% OF THOSE WHO
RECEIVED BENEFIT. THAT IS...

277
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,228
THOSE MOST IN NEED.

278
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,469
PENSIONERS HAVE LOST

279
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,119
28% OF THEIR PURCHASING
POWER IN 4 YEARS.

280
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,316
TOMATOES CAN COST
AS MUCH AS 7 EUROS PER KILO

281
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,595
IN SPANISH MARKETS.

282
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,271
I SEEM TO SEE MORE AND MORE
ELDERLY LADIES WITH WHITE HAIR.

283
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,194
SOLITUDE

284
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,589
I've lived alone

285
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,512
since my husband died

286
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,229
about 10 years ago.

287
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,753
And it's very sad.

288
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,430
I draw a small pension,

289
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,949
though with the euro,

290
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,318
I don't knowwhere it goes.

291
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,752
I try to buy

292
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,828
the cheapest things I can.

293
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,831
I once heard it said that

294
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,910
"A poor table

295
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,077
is the mother of good health."

296
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,471
That hasn't done me much good.

297
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,152
I haven't been out of the house for
at least 3 years. Since my fall.

298
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,636
I often think of my husband.

299
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,678
We were married

300
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,590
for 50-odd years.

301
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,633
I can't remember exactly.
My memory...

302
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,076
MADRID, 2003:
115 ELDERLY PEOPLE

303
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,708
DIED IN TOTAL SOLITUDE.

304
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,788
ADOPTION

305
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,316
Hello, Luis? Everything's set.
Tomorr...

306
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,031
What?
What do you mean?

307
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,473
You can't do that to me now!

308
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,279
Your son won't appear,
I told you that.

309
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,353
No photos. Just you and Alberto
talking about your case.

310
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,718
It has to be ready by Monday.

311
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,599
Today's Wednesday.
It was all arranged, Luis.

312
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,595
There's nothing
exceptional about your case.

313
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,797
It doesn't matter that you're
the biological father.

314
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,879
It just illustrates the subject.
You've got a child

315
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,793
who has no mother.
No need to go into that.

316
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,312
And you've lived with
your partner, a man, for 8 years.

317
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,232
So why can't Alberto legally take
the mother's place?

318
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,837
Okay, his second father.
Who cares who changes the baby?

319
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,278
Luis, tell me...

320
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,519
Why the change of heart?

321
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,035
Tell me.

322
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,073
We're doing this for
your sors sake, remember?

323
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,634
You used to say who'd look after
Pablo if you werert there.

324
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,078
You'd come whining to me.

325
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,879
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

326
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,598
Yes, I'm sorry I said that.

327
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,116
Again? Of course that's the point.
A vulnerable childhood,

328
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,431
the newfamilies who can
help remedy the situation...

329
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,913
Yes. Yes.

330
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,198
Yes.
Of course.

331
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,835
Orphans through
war and famine...

332
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,470
There's nothing wrong with
a gay couple adopting a child.

333
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,870
Then we'd go on from your specific
case to cases in general.

334
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,392
You know we said that.

335
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,357
I can't use actors.

336
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,191
It has to be real,
a documentary.

337
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,238
I want to show a real couple.

338
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,439
We've no data on how many children
live in homoparental homes here.

339
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,160
Because your government
made sure there's no data.

340
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,309
So we'll see.

341
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,152
So what's the problem?

342
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,276
Don't be ridiculous, Luis.

343
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,272
We are not
the "anti-PP filmmakers."

344
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,635
So what if it is released then?

345
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,360
You're standing for election.

346
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,832
Your real friends will stand by you.
The others can put up with it.

347
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,678
Be brave, Luis.

348
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,116
You'll be scoring a few points.

349
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,075
What about Alberto? If he agrees,
let's go for it! Listen...

350
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,800
"The country must realize
that tens of thousands

351
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,599
of children are born
and raised in households

352
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,558
of homosexual couples
and that they are entitled

353
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,075
to the same
family protection as others."

354
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,348
Your words, Luis. Who better
than you to take this step?

355
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,919
Be honest, Luis.

356
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,955
Okay.

357
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,751
Okay, okay.
All right.

358
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,998
Is that your last word?

359
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,511
Okay.
One more thing, Luis.

360
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,830
Your boy and
many other children

361
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,952
would have been grateful.

362
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,959
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD

363
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,468
I think I'm in labour.

364
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,474
You think?
Are you in labour or not?

365
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,868
I think so.

366
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,916
Hello.

367
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,034
- What's that?
- Let's bend our knees a little.

368
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,753
That's fine.

369
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,070
- My name's Luis.
- Fine, dear.

370
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,199
We'll shave you now

371
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,509
and this is
to make you pooh,

372
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,999
if that's okay with you.

373
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,669
Hold on.

374
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,319
Can I sit up a little?

375
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,828
I'm uncomfortable.

376
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,592
But you're plugged in.

377
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,354
- Where are you going?
- What about my wife?

378
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,192
I've broken your bag.

379
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,032
It'll be
a piece of cake now.

380
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,191
It's for
your own good, you know.

381
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,469
Right then.

382
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,031
Complete dilation?

383
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,317
So, using the pushes

384
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,229
and contractions,
we'll get

385
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,515
the head

386
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,113
to descend

387
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,793
through the canal.

388
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,549
Good.

389
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,589
Right. Well, we're almost
there now, lad. Now, push.

390
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,519
Come on, come on, push.
Keep going.

391
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,798
Push, no, no, no, no,
not like that. Push. Push.

392
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,632
- Lf I stand up...?
- What?

393
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,756
I wouldn't be able to see then.

394
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,520
Come on. Keep pushing.
Come on.

395
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,271
Come on. Keep pushing.
Keep it up, keep it up.

396
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,435
Good.
Keep pushing.

397
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,957
Come on, come on, come on.
Very good. Now.

398
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,478
Come on.
Very good.

399
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,835
Come on, come on.
Scissors.

400
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,509
What's that?

401
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,875
- What are you doing?
- Last push now.

402
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,195
Come on.

403
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,873
Come on, slowly now.

404
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,709
Push slowly. Very good.
Slowly.

405
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,509
Good, good. Slowly.
Very good.

406
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,552
That's it.

407
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,589
Is that it?

408
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,639
It's a boy.

409
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,954
Can I see him?

410
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,712
- Can I see him?
- He's fine.

411
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,308
Where is he?

412
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,468
Where is he?

413
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,794
He's not crying!

414
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,439
Why isn't he crying?

415
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,720
- He's perfectly all right.
- He's beautiful.

416
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,997
We'll take him to observation

417
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,559
and bring him to you later.

418
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,479
CHILDBIRTH BELONGS TO US

419
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,438
GIVE IT BACK!

420
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,789
TEENAGERS

421
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,472
I'm Fernando.
I'm a secondary school teacher.

422
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,630
29% OF SECONDARY SCHOOL
CHILDREN DROP OUT OF SCHOOL

423
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,519
In class you just get bored.

424
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,079
It's not interesting.

425
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,231
I'm in third, in PAC,

426
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,033
in a special group

427
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,717
because I stayed
away from school.

428
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,077
I started off okay
but I ended up failing 6 subjects.

429
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,438
I just saw that I couldn't...

430
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,473
It was difficult
so I didn't bother.

431
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,312
Every year till this one.

432
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,232
Who likes bad pupils?

433
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,117
They do exist... But at 14
or 15 is there such a thing

434
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,834
as a "bad pupil"?

435
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,833
That's the real question.

436
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,197
There's a class called 3rd PAC.

437
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,676
The "special cases"
like me are in that.

438
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,628
All the ones who didn't get
anywhere are in the same class.

439
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,678
And they pay more attention
to us and all that.

440
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,956
They should have paid more
attention to us before really.

441
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,429
But anyway...

442
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,194
In a class of 30
I felt left out.

443
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,557
They concentrate
on the ones who study,

444
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,029
the ones who want
to do something.

445
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,714
In a class of 30,

446
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,348
there's always one
they neglect.

447
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,432
A lot of teachers gabble on
and that's the lesson,

448
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,995
and the pupils
don't understand a word.

449
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,390
But they don't care
if they do or not.

450
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,790
The teachers
don't motivate you

451
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,713
so you say what's the point
and you stop going.

452
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,670
84% OF TEACHERS' PROBLEMS ARE
PSYCHOLOGICAL OR PSYCHIATRIC.

453
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,112
You might know
your subject inside out

454
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,994
but yet

455
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,152
working with intuition
at a job...

456
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,513
you don't really... the training
they gave us wasrt particularly good

457
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,558
when it came to
getting closer to pupils.

458
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,156
If they treat you well,
they help you,

459
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,831
they're on your side,

460
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,674
then your self-esteem
gets boosted.

461
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,037
You don't exactly study but

462
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,640
you do feel
more comfortable in class.

463
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,910
It's no effort to listen
because the lessons are interesting.

464
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,914
It's a very different relationship,
more supportive...

465
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,029
And you make a special effort
to keep on and you say,

466
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,112
"They're going out
of their way for you,

467
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,633
so do the same for them."

468
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,997
One mark of our society
is competitiveness.

469
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,796
And you get that at school too

470
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,916
when you do your subjects.

471
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,519
For that you need

472
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,750
means for studying

473
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,195
and these kids
haven't got those means.

474
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,191
SPAIN IS LAST IN THE EU FOR
SECONDARY SCHOOL SPENDING.

475
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,269
I think we all feel
a bit alone.

476
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,078
I do anyway, a little.

477
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,118
I get bored all the time
in this village.

478
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,068
The same old monotonous life,
doing the same old things...

479
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,269
Yeah, I get bored here. There's
nothing to do, or nothing much.

480
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,829
I don't know...
People take drugs

481
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,639
because there's
nothing else to do.

482
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,629
They get bored, so they smoke
a joint and have a laugh.

483
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,039
At weekends maybe they drop
a couple of pills and feel better.

484
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,675
It's easier
to get ecstasy than books...

485
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,799
They can get their hands on any kind
of drug in less than an hour,

486
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,112
yet they take a fortnight
to get access to any kind

487
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,197
of cultural event.

488
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,155
So what are you studying now?

489
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,357
Nothing.
I stopped studying.

490
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,595
THE DEAD WOMEN'S SOCIETY

491
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,396
To those who rebel,

492
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,239
who won't keep quiet,

493
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,313
the humble and the docile,

494
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,471
those who imagine

495
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,348
impossible things,

496
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,431
the right to be happy...

497
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,910
To those who live alone,

498
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,959
trampled on,

499
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,680
those with no more hope,

500
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,671
the unprotected,

501
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,559
forgotten,

502
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,074
those who fall and get up again...

503
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,232
So many lives humiliated,

504
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,399
so many hushed-up tears...

505
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,553
The saddest thing

506
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,631
is sadness itself

507
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,590
in the Dead Womers Society.

508
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,111
Sometimes because they look,

509
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,273
or keep quiet,

510
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,034
thinking they'll give
themselves away,

511
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,633
sometimes because
they tell others,

512
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,833
because they cry,

513
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,998
or because they don't
understand a thing...

514
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,799
Some forgive everything,
even those who kill them

515
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,473
for a kiss, for a look.

516
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,990
Some expect everything
from the one they love

517
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,353
and don 't lose hope.

518
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,958
So many lives humiliated,

519
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,796
so many hushed-up tears.

520
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,997
The saddest thing
is sadness itself

521
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,475
in the Dead

522
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,030
Womers Society.

523
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,150
Burned, dragged

524
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,719
by the hair,

525
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,559
tortured, devastated,

526
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,077
legally raped, stabbed...

527
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,433
Some judges look at them
and turn away.

528
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,197
The men say they felt jealous,

529
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,918
their minds went blank,

530
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,192
they didn't know
what they were doing.

531
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,191
And when they drink, they say

532
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,032
they werert themselves.

533
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,312
This hell isn't me anymore.

534
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,989
So many lives humiliated,

535
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,510
so many hushed-up tears...

536
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,797
The saddest thing
is sadness itself

537
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,676
in the Dead Womers Society.

538
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,794
In the Dead

539
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,589
Womers Society.

540
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:35,310
In the Dead Womers Society.

541
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,872
I N 2003, 68 WOM EN DI ED
DUE TO MISTREATMENT.

542
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,754
30.7% MORE
THAN THE PREVIOUS YEAR.

543
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,509
SCHOOL FOR SALE

544
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,914
We're a group of parents
who chose a school for

545
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,993
our children with no religious
or political affiliations.

546
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,995
On 8th September
the school year began

547
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,997
and on the 15th we received a note
asking us to attend a meeting

548
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,800
as there'd been a sale
of school property to something

549
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,837
called
the "Legionnaires of Christ."

550
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,150
They made 3 important points...

551
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,276
They wanted to separate
the boys and girls

552
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,830
due to some theoretical difference
in intellectual development...

553
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,595
They wanted to build
a kind of chapel

554
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,190
in the playground
or the sports facilities...

555
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,472
And they would hold communion
for those pupils who wanted it.

556
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,393
It so happened
that these meetings

557
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,990
were attended by people
posing as parents,

558
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,720
but after a few meetings
they were unmasked.

559
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,435
Finally every adult attending
the meetings was asked

560
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,511
to identify him or herself.

561
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,671
Many children left the school,

562
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,277
leaving their books, footballs...

563
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,513
satchels and classmates
of 10 years' standing behind.

564
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,399
We saw that
the authorities, the laws,

565
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,678
practically everything, allowed
this kind of thing to happen.

566
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,559
An ex-seminarist
of the Legionnaires

567
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,838
got in touch with us anonymously
by e-mail to explain why

568
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,991
the children were
to be separated.

569
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,116
They were separated because

570
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,078
the idea was to capture
future seminarists

571
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,515
from the boys' group.

572
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,955
This happened to us recently,

573
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,316
but it's happened before.

574
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,913
Last year
it was in Valencia

575
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,992
and with the political climate
the way it is now,

576
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,631
everything's in their favour.
This is worrying for all Spaniards.

577
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,030
This may seem
a very specific problem

578
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,350
in a very minority sector,

579
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,949
but we don't think
that's the case.

580
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,315
That isn't the problem because

581
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,197
the ideological principles
of the religious group

582
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,873
that's bought our school

583
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,471
are exactly the same as those

584
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,836
which the Spanish
Episcopal Conference

585
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,878
are dictating
for the subject matter

586
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,108
of religious education
at state schools

587
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,475
to be taught
from September this year.

588
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,950
The ultra-conservative order
we're talking about

589
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,430
makes references
to Pope Pius Xll,

590
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,637
and their doctrine refers
to an order whose founder,

591
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,678
as we mentioned before,
comes from Mexico

592
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,594
and who in the U.S.
And in Mexico has been accused

593
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,389
of paedophilia. Obviously
we want this to come out

594
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,514
but the lawsuits
are taking time

595
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,194
and no-one knows
for sure what's going on.

596
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,749
Other investigations
have revealed

597
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,918
that they're a powerful force
in the U.S.,

598
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,516
that they run bogus
trading companies in Panama

599
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,557
and other countries,
and in Europe

600
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,429
they've used Spain as a springboard
for neighbouring countries,

601
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,556
and it seems that

602
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,917
there's sufficient information
on the Internet

603
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,798
for anyone to see

604
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,430
to describe the Legionnaire's
of Christ as a sect.

605
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,388
When the PP came to power
at Madrid Town Hall,

606
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,120
it stopped grants
to an association

607
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,277
which investigated sects.

608
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,000
This was apparently endorsed

609
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,073
by the fact that the mayor,
Mr. Alvarez del Manzano,

610
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,390
was surrounded
by important people

611
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,835
who belonged
not only to the Opus Dei

612
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,752
but also to
Liberation and Communion

613
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,751
and the Legionnaires.

614
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,911
THE "EL BOSQUE"
PARENTS ASSOCIATION

615
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,832
(VILLAVICIOSA DE ODON - MADRID)

616
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,559
CATECHISM

617
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,873
Perhaps if it is told
as a simple story,

618
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,237
we can understand the problem
in all its magnitude.

619
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,591
Once there was
a parish priest

620
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,235
who played with little girls

621
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,960
who had been sent
to him by their families

622
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,273
to be taught
religious principles.

623
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,074
After a good dose
of the catechism

624
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,073
to numb their minds,

625
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,433
he sat them
on his lap and put

626
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,477
his holy fingers

627
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,275
under the lace
of their little panties

628
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,994
and then into
their vaginal openings.

629
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,078
Once there, he paused,

630
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,471
his pleasure
increasing in direct proportion

631
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,678
to the panic
of the little girl who sat

632
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,678
"catechized" on his knees.

633
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,676
Such facts were proved

634
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,435
and as a result
the catechizing priest

635
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,750
who took advantage
of the little girls

636
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,112
received an unappealable sentence
from the Cordoba court

637
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,157
of 11 years in jail.

638
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,271
When the church authorities
heard of this judgement,

639
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,839
the bishop of Cordoba,

640
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,356
in whose diocese the atrocities
I have told you of took place,

641
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,354
gave his moral support
to the priest,

642
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,919
refusing to sack him.

643
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,313
The next day however,

644
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,956
surprised by the general alarm
caused by this act of complicity

645
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,715
with the perverse priest,
he did decide to sack him,

646
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,958
without excommunicating him

647
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,829
or withdrawing the moral support
he had given him.

648
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,159
The bishop and the priest

649
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,318
belong to a religious confession

650
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,631
which receives state aid

651
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,911
and whose beliefs
the government

652
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,594
has allowed to be taught

653
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,149
as a compulsory subject
at schools.

654
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,995
The teachers of this subject

655
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,069
work within a framework
on the fringes of the constitution.

656
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,590
48 hours after the scandal
reached the newspapers,

657
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,834
the government had
still not called

658
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,956
its ambassador at the Vatican

659
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,669
or urged the public prosecutor

660
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,832
to decide whether the bishop
of Cordoba's attitude

661
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,709
could be construed as
justification of sexual harassment.

662
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,878
Of course the government,

663
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,675
a month after Fraga gave
his support to a Galician mayor

664
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,559
who was also fond of playing

665
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,358
with little girls,

666
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,076
has not expelled
this mayor from the party.

667
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,753
On the contrary, the government
has reduced to a minimum

668
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,276
the grant given to

669
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,473
the only centre for the recovery
and social rehabilitation

670
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,471
of battered women

671
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,518
which addressed the problem
of violence against women

672
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,111
in its entirety.

673
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,437
And that is
the end of the story...

674
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,317
WRITTEN BY JOSE MILLAS
"EL PAIS" 13TH FEBRUARY 2004.

675
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,478
Drug prevention campaigns

676
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,073
always seem to be aimed

677
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,959
at young people who
have still not approached

678
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,394
the world of drugs.

679
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,437
So it's, "Don't take drugs."

680
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,951
"Say no to drugs."
And that's it.

681
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,437
So once you've started,

682
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,556
there's nothing more to say.

683
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,956
So it's, "Come here,

684
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,712
take drugs here,
do what you want."

685
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,990
And ghettos
like this spring up.

686
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,310
And there are groups
which no-one cares about.

687
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,109
We're just trying
to maintain, to contain

688
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,713
public health,

689
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,552
albeit it at minimal levels

690
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,199
but this is a high-risk

691
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,112
health hazard for everyone.

692
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,396
Here 5,000 people
come and go each day,

693
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,518
maybe 10,000.
And they're exposed to high levels

694
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,830
of risk
of all sorts of disease.

695
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,195
This is a focus
for tuberculosis

696
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,430
due to the overcrowded conditions.

697
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,909
And people do get infected here.

698
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,949
30% to 40% are HIV positive

699
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,350
and when syringes run short,

700
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,394
it's difficult
to control transmission.

701
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:55,072
In Madrid, 8,000 have died
of AIDS, while drug deaths

702
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,073
can be estimated at
300 to 500 a year.

703
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,435
And if we talk
of the last 10 years,

704
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,796
that's thousands
of people.

705
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,350
There's no funding,
no hostels, no basic resources

706
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,033
from the social services.

707
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,593
And people are being turned away
from drug addiction centres...

708
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,671
Some have an ID
but no medical card.

709
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,751
Others a medical card but they're
not registered, in which case

710
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,793
they don't have an ID card.
These are purely

711
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,195
bureaucratic requirements

712
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,551
that exclude the people

713
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,188
most in need
of specific services.

714
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,920
So despite
the existing aid systems,

715
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,040
these people
just can't get to them.

716
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,953
So I can come here
and approach the people

717
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,636
but anyone with AIDS
has to go to a specific hospital.

718
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,598
But we must start thinking
about methods of treatment,

719
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,828
because nothing's
being done to stop this.

720
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,195
But nobody asks
how we can do it.

721
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,119
This is like a disaster area.
In an area

722
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,429
that's just poor

723
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,750
you don't find people like this.

724
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,115
And the approach seems to be

725
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,397
that the less
said about this the better.

726
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,596
The dilemma
is Las Barranquillas.

727
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,159
The populated area.

728
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,636
There's no hope here.

729
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,677
No-one helps us out.

730
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,389
We came here to die.
Tell people that.

731
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,115
When I came to Madrid
everything was great.

732
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,753
I travelled the city, full of
sensations, like when you travel

733
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,955
my skin.

734
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,232
The city opened up before me,

735
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,994
like you open me up.

736
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,113
Everything was warm
and welcoming, like your body.

737
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,118
No, you haven't seen Madrid.

738
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,074
That never happened.

739
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,752
That Madrid doesn't exist.
That didn't happen.

740
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,193
You must have dreamt it.

741
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,031
All I sawwas surveillance.

742
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,354
Easy now, easy...

743
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,351
I've seen 2nd May Square filled
with people the whole night long.

744
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,473
The things you can do
in a square the whole night long!

745
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,472
All night long... in a square

746
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,959
filled with people.

747
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,829
You've got it wrong.

748
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,711
You haven't seen
2nd May Square.

749
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,399
I saw my friends cry
and stand up against the war.

750
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,799
Crying like the Trojan women,
against the war.

751
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,509
No, nobody was crying.

752
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,753
You imagined it.

753
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,153
That's not why they were crying.

754
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,517
Many have loved
Madrid's light, Madrid's skies.

755
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,958
I've loved Madrid's nights.

756
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,676
I've loved Madrid's nights.

757
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,632
You haven't seen Madrid.

758
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,472
All that exists is a city
under surveillance, harassed,

759
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,754
scared.

760
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,150
Where you can
only expect barbarians.

761
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,309
Freedom of expression!

762
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,195
Then what's
the point of memory

763
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,271
if there's nothing
beyond your skin,

764
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,795
if there's air
only in this room?

765
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,274
What memory?

766
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,431
Get up, I'll showyou.

767
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,954
AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH...

768
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,436
I guarantee and wish to promote
a policy of dialogue with everyone.

769
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,518
And wish to talk to everyone.

770
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,757
The political parties,
the autonomous communities,

771
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,356
the institutions,
the economic agents,

772
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,874
the workers.

773
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,679
We must all form part
of a national endeavour

774
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,274
to bring about
historic change in Spain.

775
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,034
Everyone knows

776
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,112
that Saddam Hussein
has weapons of mass destruction.

777
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,718
You can be sure,

778
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,713
and everyone watching us
now can be sure,

779
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,319
that that is the truth.

780
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,719
You are wrong.

781
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,993
Weapons of mass destruction exist

782
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,434
and you will see them.

783
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,352
You have lost your way.

784
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,557
The only "proof"
you have shown us has been false.

785
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,359
We knew you were preparing
your next demonstration.

786
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,511
There's no need
to tell us so now.

787
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,955
You'll take us into history
by the back door.

788
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,519
Will you get us
out of the corner?

789
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,752
We all know how fond you are

790
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,155
of dusting off
all the old clichés

791
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,356
and reminding us of them.

792
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,793
The Spanish government
has information

793
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,233
that the Iraqi regime,

794
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,038
Saddam Husseirs regime,

795
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,991
by virtue of
biological weapons,

796
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,153
chemical weapons,

797
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,353
and links to
terrorist groups,

798
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,839
is a threat to peace
and world security.

799
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,595
The President has never said
that to his knowledge,

800
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,954
to his knowledge...

801
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,680
Iraq has weapons
of mass destruction.

802
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,469
Never believe you are
in sole possession of the truth,

803
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,234
and respect others
and their opinions.

804
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,038
Since the end of the war

805
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,158
500 more deaths are being
recorded per month in Baghdad.

806
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:49,072
No official or unofficial
communication exists

807
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,437
pointing to intoxication.

808
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,878
Alcohol has been detected in the
bodies of at least 2 crew members.

809
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,032
They denied this
at the beginning,

810
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,997
but it was just another lie.

811
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,469
The Ministry of Defence
is working on it

812
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,792
and I am sure that
it is attending to the people

813
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,918
and will ensure that
this never happens again.

814
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,596
They've been lying to us,
that's completely obvious now.

815
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,593
Our loss is
painful enough as it is,

816
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,990
but being lied to
is just as painful.

817
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,232
Spanish radio and TV,
the judiciary,

818
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,392
the National Audit Office,
the Taxpayer's Statute,

819
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,790
the laws
governing pubic safety

820
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,797
and freedom of expression,

821
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:36,112
which it would never occur to me
to encroach on. I would never

822
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,669
allow anyone to tamper with
that freedom in Spain.

823
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,549
You must be very happy
with Spanish Television.

824
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,269
You've turned it into
your own private TV company,

825
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,318
your personal TV station,

826
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,631
using it not only to criticize

827
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,598
and insult
your political opponents

828
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,716
but also to constantly

829
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,350
air the insults
and criticism

830
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:04,229
which your government
makes against the opposition.

831
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,118
Will security please

832
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,191
remove from
the public gallery

833
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,918
all those persons

834
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,559
who are causing a disturbance.

835
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,273
NO WAR

836
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,634
Will security please

837
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,995
clear the public gallery.

838
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,279
Will security please clear
the public gallery immediately.

839
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,276
The European cultural exception
is the specific economic

840
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,517
and cultural interest
of some European countries...

841
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,193
...whose cultures
and languages are not expandable.

842
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,033
But I do not believe in what is
called the cultural exception.

843
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,234
The cultural exception
is the refuge

844
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,476
of cultures that are being

845
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,959
defeated,

846
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,838
that are in retreat,

847
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,874
and that has nothing to do with
the meaning of Spanish culture.

848
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,790
Which means that Spain,

849
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,632
irrespective of other values,

850
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,560
is a country
taken very seriously,

851
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,189
taken into account
and respected

852
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,518
and it seems that in
the American parliament,

853
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,513
in Congress and the Senate,
things are resolved.

854
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:15,151
Thus we are committed only
to material reconstruction.

855
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:18,357
We do this for a nation
to recover its dignity

856
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,112
and for the stability
of the region.

857
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,874
It is a large cake.
I hope we all have a chance

858
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,837
but the problem
is public order.

859
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,595
An article in the newspaper
about a number of people dying

860
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,318
could put investors off.

861
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,349
We are in agreement in calling this
looting by the occupiers.

862
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,191
I am a man whom fate

863
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,797
mauled with the claws
of a savage beast.

864
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,552
How many young Spaniards
cannot buy a home?

865
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:51,672
By how much has the cost
of housing multiplied

866
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,833
in the last few years?

867
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,638
What happened to state-subsidized
and publicly promoted housing?

868
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,959
We shall launch
a project whereby

869
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:08,272
600,000 state-subsidized homes
will be built in the near future.

870
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,791
Remember, Mr. Gonzalez,

871
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,674
what you said in 1982

872
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,631
in an interview
with Spanish Television:

873
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,309
"The socialists will never

874
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,278
use state TV against anyone."

875
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:27,792
Never! And somebody said,
"That's on tape."

876
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,914
And it is on tape,
Mr. Gonzalez.

877
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,839
WEAPONS OF MEDIA DESTRUCTION

878
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,795
20th June, 21 hours since midnight
and all normal except for

879
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,394
a few violent incidents
involving pickets.

880
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:02,031
Public transport has been normal
with minimum services at 100%.

881
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:06,318
Factories have operated with their
gates closed to avoid provocation.

882
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,119
90% of all petrol stations
have opened,

883
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,795
and the distribution of bread and
other foodstuffs has been normal

884
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,552
throughout the day.

885
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,670
Mariano Rajoy has praised

886
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,150
the police for guaranteeing
the right to work.

887
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,436
He gave the figures
this afternoon,

888
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,798
concluding that few people
have joined the strike.

889
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,355
The strike has not been general.

890
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,558
It has been a partial strike,

891
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,995
and therefore
not very general.

892
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,991
OVER 10,000,000 WORKERS
WENT ON STRI KE

893
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,071
OVER 4 MILLION PROTESTED

894
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,276
THE MINISTER OF LABOUR
RESIGNED

895
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,835
...17% ofthe working population.

896
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,230
Minimum services have been 100%

897
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,712
and this morning those who were
not sure about public transport

898
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,031
took their cars, bringing
the rush forward by half an hour.

899
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,119
Vice President Rato
has called these results

900
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,193
the worst defeat
of the Socialist Party for decades.

901
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,669
From the political point of view,

902
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,355
the general strike has been
the worst political defeat

903
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,159
of the Socialist Party
in the last 20 years.

904
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,352
United

905
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,916
we have done it!

906
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,510
The general strike

907
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,474
has been massive in Madrid!

908
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,508
Today has seen the beginning

909
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:35,032
of the social
and political demise

910
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,997
of the Popular Party.

911
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,957
Candido said it, I say it...

912
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,551
Let them change course

913
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,756
or this is only the first strike.

914
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,353
Up with the general strike!

915
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,636
SPANISH TELEVISION
WAS ORDERED

916
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,438
TO RECTIFY BY THE COURTS.

917
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,836
The Social Court
has ruled in favour

918
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,833
of the CCOO trade uniors suit
against Spanish Television

919
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,232
concerning the violation
of the fundamental right

920
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,710
to strike as a result
of news coverage

921
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,436
of the strike
on 20th June 2002.

922
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,070
The ruling, which can be appealed,
obliges Spanish Telecision

923
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,038
to broadcast this ruling
on its news programmes.

924
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,431
Spanish Television
and its subsidiary companies

925
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:26,229
have appealed to the Supreme
Court against this ruling.

926
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,914
MANIPULATION

927
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,600
We are journalists
who work for TV.

928
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,429
For fear of reprisals sim ilar
to those taken in the past,

929
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,790
we feel obliged
to remain anonymous.

930
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,989
We wish to denounce
certain serious facts

931
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,674
connected with
the news programmes.

932
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,716
Political control
and news censorship

933
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,269
have reached
hitherto unknown limits.

934
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,837
The heads of the news department
are only concerned that news

935
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,197
should serve the electoral interests
of the Popular Party.

936
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,678
Said heads of the department

937
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:21,515
have ordered reporters to use
extreme caution regarding the Fabra

938
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,875
and mayor of Toques scandals,

939
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,595
both concerning
members of the PP.

940
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,548
They have also ordered reporters to
give full coverage to the scandal

941
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,359
caused by the meeting
between Carod-Rovira and ETA.

942
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,757
However, no coverage has been
given to the controversy

943
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:41,072
over the partisan use
of the intelligence services.

944
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,349
A few days ago
much publicity was given

945
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,353
to a recording
in which Jose Bono,

946
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,034
unaware that his voice
was being recorded,

947
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,436
was heard to remark

948
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,030
that Tony Blair was a wanker.

949
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,318
The first part of the conversation
was never aired, however.

950
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,913
In it Bono said,

951
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,635
"Arenas told me
they're not very happy,

952
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,474
that Rajoy's
not a patch on Aznar."

953
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:09,031
There have been meetings with
reporters from the department

954
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,630
where the following comment
was made...

955
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,354
"You should learn
from those in Italy.

956
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,159
There left-wing journalists

957
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:19,073
never work for
a right-wing news medium."

958
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,515
We consider all these facts
to be sufficiently serious

959
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,312
to be brought out in the open.

960
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,789
They can all
be easily checked.

961
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,469
Thank you.
Signed...

962
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,280
journalists from
Antena 3 Television.

963
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,754
I'm just an actor.
This manifesto

964
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,709
has been released on the Internet
by journalists from Antena 3 TV.

965
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,756
They wish to remain anonymous
for fear of reprisals.

966
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,113
Thank you for listening.

967
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:57,072
WE ARE NOT BEING MANIPULATED
BY STATE TELEVISION ALONE

968
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,474
MY THIRTY EUROS

969
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,318
I'm working for
a cleaning company.

970
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,710
It operates at...

971
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,797
the Barajas Plan site
at the airport.

972
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:19,156
Anyway, it all started with the
inauguration of the new terminal

973
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,470
and Mr. Aznar and Co.

974
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:25,231
The day of the inauguration
we workers

975
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:30,637
were forbidden entry
to the facilities... to the site.

976
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,997
I think it was to make it look
like everything was finished,

977
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,634
which just wasrt true because

978
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,708
it's a big mess there,

979
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,235
there's rubble
falling everywhere,

980
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,510
crap falling everywhere...

981
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,035
I mean it's still
an ongoing job...

982
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,910
I don't know
how much longer it needs,

983
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,719
but there's still
a lot left to do.

984
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,838
But somebody told us
what happened that day.

985
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,551
There were 4 or 5 men standing
around in new uniforms

986
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,756
while all the bigwigs
were there cutting tape.

987
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,353
And I felt really indignant
so I wrote a letter to "El País".

988
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,518
You see,
I get a pathetic wage

989
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,514
and they docked me
a whole day's pay. It was...

990
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,875
How much do you earn?

991
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,871
I'm embarrassed to say...

992
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:23,953
But of course if they docked me
30 euros then it's 600, isn't it?

993
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,315
But that's a lot
of money to me.

994
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:29,638
A lot. So that's why
I wrote the letter.

995
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,836
Because I felt
indignant about it...

996
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,150
we all felt
indignant about it,

997
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,314
but I didn't feel
like keeping quiet about it,

998
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,672
you know?
So...

999
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,834
I decided
to go ahead with it.

1000
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,550
I invited Mr. Aznar
and Mr. Cascos

1001
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,472
and all the other people

1002
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:53,633
involved to give me
some kind of answer.

1003
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,911
I want some kind of answer.

1004
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,958
I really do think

1005
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,758
that they owe me that money.

1006
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,356
It's mine and...

1007
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,114
I think it's only fair.

1008
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,272
I know it's only a pittance

1009
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,713
but that's the way I see it.

1010
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,034
DOUBLE MORALITY

1011
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,913
A dictatorship can apply
state terrorism

1012
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,831
because terrorism can be applied
by governments, terrorist groups,

1013
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,036
or by states.
It all depends.

1014
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,073
My mother was one
of the Spanish victims

1015
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,352
who died in the attack

1016
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,953
on the Spanish embassy.

1017
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,194
They died in 1980

1018
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,396
in the attack by the police

1019
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,154
of Guatemala in which
40 people were killed

1020
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:46,869
including the consul,
my mother,

1021
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,792
all the workers there,

1022
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,758
and the peasants
who'd taken the embassy.

1023
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:57,073
My name's Cesar Torrego and I'm
the la?? Er to a Guatemalan citizen

1024
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,639
who worked at the embassy

1025
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,438
when it was attacked.

1026
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,876
The judicial proceedings
were open for 36 days,

1027
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,310
no investigation
was made and Spain

1028
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,038
didn't investigate either.

1029
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,515
Our aim was to win
compensation for the families.

1030
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,354
Last December,

1031
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,910
the supreme court
rejected our application

1032
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:26,232
in view of the fact
that the Guatemalan state forces

1033
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,271
were not responsible
for the deaths

1034
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:32,155
as they were not a terrorist group
and Spanish constitutional order

1035
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,709
or its sovereignty
had not been affected.

1036
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,235
When peace came
to Guatemala in 1996,

1037
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,233
the UN wrote a report

1038
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,551
describing the case
as one of state terrorism.

1039
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:46,280
It was only one of the many cases
of state terrorism

1040
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,670
in Guatemala.
The final death toll was 200,000.

1041
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,759
Compensation has been paid

1042
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,070
according
to the state terrorist law.

1043
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,312
For example in the case of

1044
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,596
the Spanish Twin Towers victim.

1045
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,830
It was paid

1046
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:07,234
according to the law of solidarity,
which has been extended since then.

1047
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:11,589
Since 9-11, any Spaniard
killed in an act of terrorism

1048
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,957
abroad has been included
in the terms of that law.

1049
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,951
In fact,
people dying in Iraq

1050
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,958
have also been included,
except in one case.

1051
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:21,553
The rest was not terrorism.

1052
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:26,878
So that's the double morality.
Why some and not others?

1053
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:32,557
The actions of a dictatorship can be
seen as acts of terrorism too.

1054
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,871
All dictatorships are bad.

1055
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,472
The dictatorship
I at least lived under

1056
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,514
was nothing like
the system we live in today.

1057
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,352
And by a state...

1058
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:48,070
a state has many more means

1059
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,119
to do damage, hasn't it?

1060
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,750
The army, the armed forces.
Much more.

1061
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,791
It's more difficult
to judge a state.

1062
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,748
Much more than judging
a street gang...

1063
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,710
Things should only
be done legally.

1064
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:10,632
Otherwise anything could be done
in the name of the state.

1065
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,920
Terrorism is terrorism
for all, right?

1066
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:19,195
Not only for those
who say it is or it isn't.

1067
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,073
Bush. He's the biggest
terrorist of them all.

1068
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:25,791
But he's the one who calls
the shots so people don't realize.

1069
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,196
Or maybe don't want to realize.

1070
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:33,554
FENCE

1071
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,233
WELCOME TO CEUTA

I'm hungry, I'm afraid.
Can I come in?

1078
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,674
SPANISH FOR FOREIGN STUDENTS

1079
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:47,197
Welcome to our country.
We hope you have

1080
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:48,918
a pleasant stay.

1081
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:52,951
Are you here on business
or for pleasure?

1082
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,713
Anything to declare?

1083
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,680
Any whisky or cigarettes?

1084
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,271
Which dock does
the ship sail from?

1085
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,352
Where's my cabin?

1086
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,149
Is there a reduction
for children?

1087
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:11,839
I want to rent a car.
What's the daily/hourly rate?

1088
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:15,399
Can you recommend
a good restaurant?

1089
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,071
A cup of coffee, please.

1090
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:22,279
I'd like an exterior room.
Two persons, with a jacuzzi.

1091
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,431
How long will you
be staying, sir?

1092
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:29,554
Where can I change money,
please? A traveller's cheque?

1093
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,269
What time is lunch?

1094
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,949
Serve me now, please.
I'm in a hurry.

1095
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,796
I'll have today's set meal.

1096
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,078
I'll start with a consomme.

1097
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:52,789
Then I'll have a rare steak.

1098
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,712
I'd like to see
some original gifts.

1099
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,109
Where is

1100
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:00,794
- the shirt department?
- On the ground floor.

1101
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:04,995
Can you recommend a night club

1102
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:07,230
that's not too expensive?

1103
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,028
Shampoo.

1104
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,159

Lifejacket.

1112
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,872
- All the best.
- Same to you.

1113
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,678
- Happy Easter.
- Happy New Year.

1114
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:30,193
Good luck.

1115
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,429
ACCORDING
TO THE INTERIOR MINISTRY,

1116
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,797
92 BODIES OF IMMIGRANTS
WERE RECOVERED LAST YEAR.

1117
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,871
MANY MORE PROBABLY DIED.

1118
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,554
Terrorism should be combatted
by the rule of law,

1119
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,039
respecting individual liberties.

1120
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,953
No-one may be deprived
of his or her freedom.

1121
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,509
...something
I've always practised.

1122
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:57,999
My brother has been

1123
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:01,516
at the military base in Guantanamo
for 2 years and 3 months.

1124
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,717
The UN Human Rights Commission

1125
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:09,590
has declared the detention of all
the Guantanamo prisoners arbitrary.

1126
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,594
Preventive detention
must not last

1127
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,513
more than a strictly necessary
period of time.

1128
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:19,035
No charges, no evidence.

1129
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,350
And has urged
the US government

1130
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,158
to free
all the prisoners there.

1131
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,232
As I see it,
international law is the basis.

1132
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,391
...in violation
of international law.

1133
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,949
I suffer because
he's my brother.

1134
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,997
The presence of
a la?? Er is guaranteed.

1135
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,516
No la?? Er has seen him
at Guantanamo.

1136
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,798
The family found out

1137
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:40,110
from reports on TV.

1138
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,316
Anyone who is detained
must be informed

1139
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,552
of his or her rights and the reasons
for his or her detention.

1140
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:50,032
And the government never contacted
us to tell us he was there.

1141
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,919
No order,
no judicial authority exists...

1142
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:56,072
In a period of 72 hours.

1143
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:58,117
They've been
virtually kidnapped.

1144
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:02,398
The Guantanamo prisoners
are treated

1145
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:06,395
as if they werert human,
chained hand and foot,

1146
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,632
hooded,
they can't hear anything,

1147
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,189
they can't see anything.

1148
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,918
They shall not be tortured or
punished or treated inumanely.

1149
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,753
The treatment is inumane.

1150
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,196
Our strength is the moral
superiority of democratic systems.

1151
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,794
They've undermined
the meaning of human rights.

1152
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,349
Guantanamo is one of
the US's biggest mistakes.

1153
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:32,308
It is truly surprising that our
Minister of the Exterior

1154
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,038
should call a crime

1155
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,519
a mistake.

1156
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:40,116
It's deplorable that anyone should
say they are in a kind of limbo.

1157
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:44,195
Detaining people
that way is kidnapping.

1158
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:48,239
She's the one in limbo, as no
other member of the government

1159
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,709
has criticized the situation

1160
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,757
albeit in such a mild manner.

1161
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:57,038
And we want a place in the front
line in the defence of democracy...

1162
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,873
My brother is Spanish.
He was born in Ceuta.

1163
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:03,476
He swore allegiance
to the Spanish flag,

1164
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,392
he did his military service.

1165
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,039
All Spaniards are equal.

1166
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,509
And I would ask the government

1167
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:13,116
why they haven't attached any
importance to my brother's case.

1168
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,432
Because he's a Moslem
or a second-class Spaniard?

1169
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,478
There shall be no discrimination
of any kind

1170
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:22,552
for reasons of birth,
race, creed...

1171
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:25,314
He's been
discriminated against.

1172
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,752
If his name were Juan Lopez
instead of Hamed Abderraman,

1173
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,958
they'd have done something

1174
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,354
without waiting

1175
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,317
2 years and 3 months.

1176
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,637
In Spain the US
has a staunch ally.

1177
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:41,229
They've done everything badly,

1178
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,755
but better late than never.

1179
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,673
All have a right
to freedom and safety.

1180
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:49,149
To make the world
a safer, freer place.

1181
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,515
They are trampling
on the constitution

1182
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,193
and human rights.

1183
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:56,194
We shall work together
for democracy

1184
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:58,191
and freedom the world over.
Thank you.

1185
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,999
We should get out
of this as soon as possible.

1186
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:02,639
We're having a bad time.

1187
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:08,474
SECOND-CLASS DEATHS

1188
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,154
My son, Jose Couso,
was in Baghdad.

1189
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,032
He'd been sent there

1190
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:18,478
by Telecinco TV
to cover the possible war.

1191
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,394
And the people
were working there,

1192
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,997
reporting, from where they shouldn't
have been in the first place...

1193
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:28,391
And he said to me, "Mum, I have
to be here because I need

1194
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,755
to tell the people
what's happening.

1195
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,879
Because they're going
to storm the place."

1196
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:37,750
A colleague of mine rang me,

1197
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,275
from Telemadrid TV.
He said,

1198
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:42,715
"They're attacking
the Hotel Palestine."

1199
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,953
And I went to my
daughter-in-law Lola's place.

1200
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,832
And when Juan Pedro Valentin
called her,

1201
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,310
she collapsed
and I knew that Jose

1202
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,193
was dead.

1203
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,672
Over a period of an hour
and a half they attacked

1204
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,035
the offices

1205
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,350
of the news agencies there.
Three of them.

1206
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:08,871
The independent ones I mean,
not the embedded ones.

1207
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:12,436
There was
the Al-Jazeera office.

1208
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:16,559
They killed Tarik Ayub.
And there was Abu Dhabi TV,

1209
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,073
a lot of people injured...

1210
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:21,357
And then the Hotel Palestine.

1211
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,193
We said it was
a deliberate attack.

1212
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:27,158
Sgt. Dixon also says

1213
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,392
he didn't fire again
till 10 minutes later

1214
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:35,315
because he asked
for confirmation

1215
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:40,272
of the order to fire
on the Hotel Palestine.

1216
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:45,269
And he did it again
10 minutes later...

1217
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,879
He fired, of course.

1218
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,713
A direct call
from the Ministry of Defence

1219
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,314
through the minister

1220
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:56,997
saying they had
my brother's body.

1221
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:01,432
Then we got in touch with the other
journalists who were there.

1222
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:05,509
They had to move
around Baghdad under fire,

1223
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:09,992
with the looting going on.
They said it was hellish,

1224
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,639
moving bodies...
The last one was Jose's.

1225
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,552
They'd gone back
to the hotel.

1226
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:18,479
Risking their lives twice
over false information.

1227
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,676
They'd fooled us twice.

1228
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,478
We're not asking

1229
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:27,193
for money of anything like that.
You can't buy what we want.

1230
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,999
We want justice,
an investigation...

1231
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:34,199
It was the premeditated murder
of people they had no control over.

1232
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:37,238
Isn't that what governments
are for? You vote for them

1233
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:40,153
so that they'll support you
but we just feel

1234
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,470
forsaken and scorned.

1235
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:45,559
I'll never forget
that arrogant look on Aznar's face

1236
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,871
when my brother's colleagues
snubbed him over the photos.

1237
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:53,113
I never thought I'd envy
the Ukrainians their government.

1238
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,113
The Ukrainian government demanded

1239
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:59,431
justice for one
of its countrymen.

1240
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,591
They didn't believe
the Americans,

1241
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,751
they gave him a medal

1242
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:06,351
and are still investigating.

1243
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:10,069
He says the other families
who kept quiet are being patriotic

1244
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,192
To him we're not patriots.

1245
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,351
But we'd say to him

1246
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,353
that we see patriotism
also as justice.

1247
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,193
And the PP remind me

1248
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,190
of others

1249
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,718
who regret but don't condemn.

1250
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:32,552
They've so much criticism
for that party they've outlawed

1251
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,593
but they're just the same.

1252
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,554
They haven't condemned
my sors killer.

1253
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:42,510
For them there are first-class
and second-class deaths.

1254
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,350
The government
regrets the deaths

1255
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,670
of two Spanish journalists
in Baghdad

1256
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,679
who were doing
their professional duty

1257
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:54,515
but who unfortunately
knew of the high degree of risk

1258
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:57,240
their presence there involved.

1259
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:00,233
Unfortunately
that high risk materialized.

1260
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:10,150
JOSE COUSO:
A SECOND-CLASS DEATH

1261
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,476
ON 26TH MAY, A UKRAINIAN
YAKOLEV-42 AIRCRAFT

1262
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,868
CRASHED IN MASKA (TURKEY)

1263
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,598
62 SPANISH SOLDIERS

1264
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,513
AND 12 UKRAINIAN CREW
WERE KILLED

1265
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,232
I want them
to tell me what happened.

1266
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:42,798
And why it happened.

1267
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,953
Nothing. They're acting
as if we were the enemy,

1268
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:51,268
instead of supporting us
and telling us what happened.

1269
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:52,919
Why did this have to happen?

1270
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:55,993
It's been 9 months

1271
01:17:56,320 --> 01:18:00,598
since 26th May, when
our 62 soldiers lost their lives

1272
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,352
and we the families
have had time

1273
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:07,074
to calm down
and analyze things

1274
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,913
without our grief
affecting our judgement.

1275
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:14,077
The minister said they'll go on
chartering those planes,

1276
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:17,152
that they'll go on
carrying our soldiers.

1277
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,832
Then 6 days later,
they cancel the contracts

1278
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,191
because of the alarm
among the population.

1279
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:29,192
But the minister of defence's job
is to guarantee our safety.

1280
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,795
And there were 14 complaints

1281
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:35,157
by soldiers who'd pointed out
how unsafe

1282
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,639
those planes were.

1283
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,395
It's the airline company
with the highest accident rate

1284
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:44,917
in the world, despite the minister
telling parliament that's not so.

1285
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,351
According to all technical data,

1286
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:50,313
the YAK-42D
is a good aircraft.

1287
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:54,632
How could it be so good when one
of the black boxes wasrt working?

1288
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,235
Everything points
to human error

1289
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,994
plus an accumulation
of adverse factors

1290
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,599
as the cause.

1291
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,716
The Ministry of Defence

1292
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,237
is trying
to sell us the story

1293
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:11,358
that it was one of the risks
they assumed is despicable.

1294
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,911
This makes me
reflect on democracy.

1295
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,798
The Spanish people
should feel protected.

1296
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:22,789
The Ministry of Defence says
there won't be an investigation.

1297
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,236
The government says
there won't be an investigation.

1298
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,990
The legal authorities are denying
us an investigation too.

1299
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:33,994
I just can't understand
how that man has the nerve

1300
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:37,836
to stay on
and hasn't tendered

1301
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,319
his resignation

1302
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,632
- to the government.
- I mean, he's got

1303
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,236
62 deaths on his conscience and
in the history of Spanish democracy

1304
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,711
no ministry has ever been
involved in so many deaths.

1305
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,275
I always knew
that as a soldier

1306
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,791
my brother might be killed
on one of his many missions,

1307
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:58,679
but never that
he'd die in a plane,

1308
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,512
a plane normally used

1309
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:03,911
to carry freight,

1310
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,918
not our soldiers.

1311
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,638
They didn't deserve that.

1312
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:11,509
The government should have
assumed the responsibility.

1313
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:15,510
And of course there's no way
that the money they've given me

1314
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:18,831
can make up for the loss of my
husband and our future together.

1315
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,276
The other reports my brother sent
as Chief of Staff

1316
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,636
mentioned the bad quality

1317
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,631
of the equipment on the plane.

1318
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:31,112
Why did the minister cover up
that information?

1319
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:35,068
Why didn't the joint chiefs
of staff, the army too,

1320
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:38,074
try and find out
what was going on?

1321
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:41,949
So that was the way they acted.
They decided to treat the families

1322
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,190
like idiots,
saying we should believe

1323
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:47,796
what they told us
and then all shut up.

1324
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:49,951
But we're not soldiers.

1325
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,914
"At least give me the consolation
of knowing the truth.

1326
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:56,032
Tell me the reason
for my grief.

1327
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,835
Don't punish me any more
with your indifference.

1328
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,395
Stop fabricating lies.

1329
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:05,871
Don't play games
or politics with my feelings.

1330
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:08,110
My grief is something real,

1331
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,595
distressing and terribly real,

1332
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,955
not a handful
of words in a speech.

1333
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:15,839
Be noble and won'thy
as they were.

1334
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,595
Don't hide behind excuses
and half-truths

1335
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,593
and accept and face up
to your responsibilities

1336
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,591
once and for all."

1337
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:30,078
TO BE CONTINUED

1338
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:35,114
THE BASQUE BALL

1339
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:43,353
I don't think that winning
democratic elections

1340
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:47,354
necessarily means that
the winner is a democrat.

1341
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,909
The PP haven't understood
the constitution

1342
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,594
or its underlying philosophy.

1343
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:55,149
At the time, he voted
against the constitution,

1344
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:57,880
as he didn't understand
the autonomous communities.

1345
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:00,952
They won't accept that
the Basque Country is a nation.

1346
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,714
Here we have the president
of a party who in 1979

1347
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:07,111
wrote a scornful criticism
of Article 8.

1348
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:12,316
He saw the chance
for the consolidation

1349
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,040
of an idea of Spain
which they saw

1350
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,758
as in decline.

1351
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:21,152
They made a comparison, saying
terrorism equals nationalism.

1352
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:24,949
What Aznar wants is not
to put an end to ETA

1353
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:28,396
but an end to nationalism.
A very anti-nationalist stance.

1354
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,950
And the Basque problem
has become a way for them

1355
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:34,879
to first of all
show firmness

1356
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,634
and then win votes
all over Spain.

1357
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,598
Something which has been
widely accepted

1358
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:43,228
by the press in Madrid.
And I say in Madrid.

1359
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,518
Zapatero dares to say that

1360
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:50,678
when they govern, they'll talk
to the Basque government.

1361
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,070
But why not now?
Wort they let him?

1362
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:58,835
There's an "us" about things
and a denying of the Basque entity

1363
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,797
of anyone not in the group.

1364
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,791
That's the worse
thing about nationalism.

1365
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:05,030
It's not a question of contempt

1366
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,997
but some who say
they're only Basque

1367
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:10,675
seem to think they have more right
to define Basque society.

1368
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,310
It's true that
the nationalist world

1369
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:19,200
has shown very little sensitivity
towards victims.

1370
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:23,239
It's necessary to learn
from the past and its mistakes.

1371
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:26,995
We must remember
that forgetting is not the way.

1372
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:30,431
I've always felt doubly a victim.

1373
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,716
I mean, you're
a victim of violence

1374
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,155
but also a victim

1375
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:38,471
of the protectors
and defenders of the victims.

1376
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,239
It now turns out that things

1377
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,994
are not just black or white...

1378
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:45,673
We must not resort

1379
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,400
to dogmatism
backed up by violence.

1380
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,913
The violence of guns

1381
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,308
or the violence

1382
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:52,913
of the monopoly
of the state's power.

1383
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:56,076
The emotional potential
of terrorism

1384
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:58,800
is booty too important
for politicians

1385
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,632
not to fight for.

1386
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,389
With the Popular Party,
all its electoral aureole,

1387
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:06,154
its movement
and strategy, revolve around

1388
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,151
the suffering ETA's caused.

1389
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,436
One thing Euskadi's good for

1390
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:14,798
is coming up with an enemy like
terrorism, which serves Bush.

1391
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,671
And as the Basque problem
has also

1392
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:20,638
been presented as
"either for me or against me,"

1393
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,631
no midpoint is possible.

1394
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,753
Mention the word "dialogue"
and you're a friend of ETA's,

1395
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,753
you're in favour of terrorism,
not the victims,

1396
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:30,592
you're with the killers.

1397
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:32,273
ETA must stop killing.

1398
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:33,873
ETA LET US LIVE IN PEACE

1399
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,792
And the PP must
open up to dialogue.

1400
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:37,598
POLITICIANS,
WE DEMAND DIALOGUE

1401
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,149
KONTRASTASUN
VERSES BY GABRIEL CELAYA

1402
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:50,111
When we Basques talk,

1403
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:54,588
our speech,
if not a song, is a cry.

1404
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,231
We Basques only talk
when something inside us

1405
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,231
demands valour.

1406
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,231
We Basques don't like
combining words

1407
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:07,551
that are more or less pretty.

1408
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:12,915
We Basques despise charlatans

1409
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,038
who adorn lies.

1410
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:52,035
We Basques listen to a man

1411
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:54,316
who, buried under centuries,

1412
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,193
bristles.

1413
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,791
We Basques with great effort

1414
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:02,072
pull the can't
of the verse that screeches.

1415
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,677
We Basques fight.

1416
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:09,390
We Basques strike
by raising life.

1417
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,355
We Basques are serious.

1418
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:16,510
Serious is our work.

1419
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,555
Serious is our joy.

1420
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,355
We Basques are true men,

1421
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:26,353
not scatterbrains
clowning around.

1422
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,831
I am Basque in my work,

1423
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:04,196
I am Basque in my reasons,

1424
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,432
and in peace,

1425
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,158
and in rage.

1426
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,834
I am Basque from within,

1427
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:13,355
and in the sacred night

1428
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,909
and the trembling of the day

1429
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,435
and in all I say

1430
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,556
and in all I keep quiet.

1431
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:24,279
More Basque than Sabino.

1432
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:30,155
TO THE VICTIMS OF TERRORISM

1433
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,675
A DINNER OF CAPTAINS

1434
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,150
We, captains
of the Merchant Navy,

1435
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:05,273
wish to show our solidarity

1436
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,518
with Apostolos Mangouras,
captain of the "Prestige,"

1437
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:12,752
whom the government
has used as a scapegoat

1438
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:15,150
to elude

1439
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:16,594
its responsibilities.

1440
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,956
Mangouras was sailing down
from the English Channel

1441
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:29,634
to Finisterre,
a norwesterly wind

1442
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,473
was blowing
and a ballast tank burst.

1443
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:35,598
The crew heard an explosion
or something similar.

1444
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:40,792
Immediately after, the ship
began to list to starboard

1445
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,077
and everything indicated
it would ultimately capsize.

1446
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,959
But he saw that
the ship could be saved

1447
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,678
and the pollution avoided.

1448
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:55,032
He faced up to his responsibilities
and did the right thing.

1449
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:58,515
Mangouras acted like a hero.

1450
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:00,955
He stayed with his ship
to the very end.

1451
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,872
It would have been easier

1452
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:06,032
to board a helicopter,
get out and go back to Greece.

1453
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,475
Captain Master
Apostolos Mangouras,

1454
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,351
we, seafaring men
like yourself,

1455
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,950
by virtue of
our nautical knowledge

1456
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:16,111
and experience as navigators,

1457
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:20,034
know that you faced up to the
accident suffered by the "Prestige"

1458
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,316
on the afternoon
of 13th November

1459
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:24,909
with a courage
and professionalism

1460
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:29,119
going far beyond the call
of duty of a good captain.

1461
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,955
We therefore consider
your present situation both

1462
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,678
unfair
and incomprehensible...

1463
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:37,479
Far from home,
deprived of your freedom.

1464
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,553
Apostolos Mangouras
was arrested.

1465
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:54,156
He spent 84 days in jail.

1466
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:57,832
He is now
out of prison on bail.

1467
01:29:58,440 --> 01:29:59,998
He is in Barcelona,

1468
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:04,557
where he must report
to the police every day.

1469
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:08,994
His trial will not take place
until 2005 at the earliest.

1470
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,640
MAYDAY: GENERAL CALL

1471
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:33,839
SHIT

1472
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:52,278
NEVER AGAIN

1473
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:04,634
If you werert a woman I'd...

1474
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:08,475
Let them stand around barking out
their resentment if they like.

1475
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:12,394
What then it is that,
after what I said in December,

1476
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:17,190
after what we said and what I said
last Friday, I say today?

1477
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:18,989
Just this.

1478
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,438
And to say that it's over.

1479
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:27,159
Let them stand around barking out
their resentment if they like.

1480
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:29,709
If you werert a woman I'd...

1481
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:31,632
Bring in the riot squad.

1482
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,788
Let them stand around barking out
their resentment if they like.

1483
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:39,396
What then is it that,
after what I said in December,

1484
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:43,758
after what we said and what I said
last Friday, I say today?

1485
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:46,274
Just this.

1486
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:49,713
And to say that it's over.

1487
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,270
The fuel oil is still cooling.

1488
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:54,954
It is leaking out
in small trickles.

1489
01:32:56,320 --> 01:33:00,950
Those who have seen it
tell me there are 4 leaks.

1490
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:04,954
4 solid plasticine-like leaks
stretching upward.

1491
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,637
It is a great honour
that the Autonomous Community

1492
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,509
should reward individual
or group merits...

1493
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,591
Bring in the riot squad.

1494
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:40,794
TECHNIQUES FOR A COUP D'ETAT

1495
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:45,071
4TH FEBRUARY 1874

1496
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:48,676
GENERAL PAVIA
ENTERS THE HOUSE

1497
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:50,956
AND ORDERS
PARLIAMENT DISSOLVED

1498
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:55,594
THUS ENDS THE FIRST REPUBLIC

1499
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:15,078
THUS ENDS THE SECOND REPUBLIC

1500
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:17,514
On the floor!

1501
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:20,035
23 FEBRUARY 1981

1502
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:25,791
THUS ENDS THE MODERATE RIGHT

1503
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,797
JULY/AUGUST 2003

1504
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:40,518
THUS ENDS THE BIPARTITE SYSTEM
AT THE MADRID ASSEMBLY

1505
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:46,670
They should leave us alone
to earn our money honestly.

1506
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,438
My money.

1507
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:53,590
And we dedicated time last night

1508
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,716
and this morning
to just that.

1509
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,914
Public life
should not be disturbed.

1510
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:04,631
People will be able to go on
going to cinemas and restaurants.

1511
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,668
It must be done
in the name of the law.

1512
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:11,196
Recourse to great words
is fundamental.

1513
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,952
Freedom, Constitution.

1514
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:14,872
Human Rights, Democracy.

1515
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:17,600
Freedom of Expression,
Freedom of the Press.

1516
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,716
Freedom. Freedom.

1517
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:22,634
Controlling the media,

1518
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:26,071
upholding lies,
denying the evidence.

1519
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:30,632
If all goes wrong,
there is always one last resort...

1520
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:35,516
"What money cannot do, a lot of
money can." - capitalist maxim

1521
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:39,790
ELECTIONS IN CATALONIA

1522
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:43,875
ESQUERRA
HAS THE KEY TO GOVERNMENT

1523
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:47,234
MARAGALL: "THE LEFT HAS WON
WHAT THE PEOPLE WANTS"

1524
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:50,153
RAJOY DEFENDS A
GOVERNMENT OF "STABILITY"

1525
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:51,548
WITHOUT ESQUERRA

1526
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:53,915
MARAGALL HOLDS OUT
HIS HAND TO THE PP

1527
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:56,071
DURING HIS SWEARING IN
AS PRES.

1528
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:59,073
I prefer to put it another way...
Every time the PP

1529
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:02,357
is in danger of losing power,
strange things happen.

1530
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:04,317
I wonder why, my colleagues.

1531
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:09,198
Two goals: To destroy the lbarretxe
Plan and the Catalan tripartite.

1532
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,831
Euskadi Ta Azkatasuna has told

1533
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,230
Euskalerria and
the people of Catalonia

1534
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:18,395
that it is suspending its campaign
of armed action in Catalonia.

1535
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:21,114
THAT CAME OVER
AS VERY NATURAL.

1536
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:22,599
WHEN DO WE GET PAID?

1537
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:26,315
WHEN WE'VE FINISHED
THE SERIES.

1538
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,436
TO BE CONTINUED

1539
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,834
THE PAST THAT AWAITS YOU

1540
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:38,474
It is leaking out in trickles.

1541
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:42,678
Those who have seen it
tell me there are 4 leaks...

1542
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:47,391
The international community
believes that Iraq has WMD.

1543
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:50,677
All housing built
in Spain, and I say all,

1544
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:55,434
is sold, often

1545
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,989
before construction begins.

1546
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:03,434
GIVE THEM YOUR SUPPORT

1547
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:11,675
THAT PESKY FLY

1548
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,876
Neither more nor less,

1549
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:56,636
nor less nor more.

1550
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:59,036
Just that.

1551
01:39:58,400 --> 01:39:59,992
NEVER AGAIN

1552
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,036
EPILOGUE

1553
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:06,714
"No war."

1554
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:10,111
It was a roar repeated
in every corner of the planet,

1555
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:13,198
but Bush, Blair
and Aznar ignored it.

1556
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:15,197
Meeting in the Azores,

1557
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:17,191
they declared war on Iraq.

1558
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:23,473
In Spain,
general elections are held.

1559
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:32,190
Montse, I'm at Atocha, there's been
a bomb on the train and we've had...

1560
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:34,715
Help!

1561
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:37,269
And there is
a chain of explosions

1562
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:40,830
on 4 Madrid-bound trains.
Almost 200 dead,

1563
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:45,838
1,500 injured, the greatest
ever terrorist attack in Europe.

1564
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:49,476
At the beginning,
suspicion focuses on ETA.

1565
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:53,879
We find
the atrocities committed

1566
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,838
tremendously repugnant.
To all Basque men and women,

1567
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:01,435
to Basque society and also to
Spanish society I wish to express

1568
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:06,158
my conviction that ETA
is writing its final pages.

1569
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:09,596
Neither from the targets
nor the modus operandi

1570
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:11,597
can it be affirmed

1571
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:14,912
that ETA is behind
what has happened in Madrid.

1572
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:17,476
SO... WHO WAS IT?

1573
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:20,035
Soon after,
some foreign media suspect

1574
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:23,078
Al Qaeda and ask
the Spanish government.

1575
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:27,313
At this moment the security forces
and corps of the Interior Ministry

1576
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:30,119
have no doubt at all that those
responsible for this attack

1577
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:32,271
belong to
the ETA terrorist group.

1578
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:35,955
We are also seeing
a smear campaign

1579
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:39,271
led by Mr. Otegi
most maliciously

1580
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:42,398
to divert the attention.

1581
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:45,912
The government immediately
reported on and evaluated

1582
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:50,198
the many signs which logically

1583
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,072
point or may point to the group,

1584
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,390
a terrorist group well-known
in Spain, as responsible.

1585
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:03,073
And I have done it personally...

1586
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,835
With all the editors

1587
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,788
of the Madrid
and Barcelona newspapers.

1588
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:14,399
But it turned out that there had
not been a smear campaign.

1589
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:16,835
But the President,

1590
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,673
when he called
the newspaper editors

1591
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,796
or addressed the nation,

1592
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:25,078
should not have presented
as certainties

1593
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:27,555
what were
simple logical deductions,

1594
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:30,872
for at that moment
deductions were all there were.

1595
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:35,312
I got a call, as did many other
foreign corespondents I know.

1596
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:38,753
A call saying,
"For us it was ETA.

1597
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:42,151
For you it has to be ETA too."
It's crystal clear

1598
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:44,318
and you can't let us down."

1599
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:47,916
It was the kind of call
putting pressure on you.

1600
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:52,392
I'd call it manipulation.
It was a case of trying

1601
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:56,150
to make people believe
what you want them to believe.

1602
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:58,318
This had never happened to me.

1603
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:01,517
In any country
I've ever been in before.

1604
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:05,232
The Exterior Ministry
urged its ambassadors

1605
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:07,391
to confirm ETA as responsible,

1606
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:09,949
taking advantage
of any opportunity to do so.

1607
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:12,078
They also put pressure
on the UN,

1608
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:14,595
which complied with
Spairs wishes.

1609
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,199
Days later,

1610
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:17,918
Spain was reproached for lying.

1611
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:22,350
I think that some people
inside the government

1612
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:26,672
were convinced,
probably including Aznar,

1613
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:29,799
that if ETA was responsible

1614
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:32,191
they'd win
an absolute majority

1615
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:36,592
but that if it was
Islamic terrorism,

1616
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:38,758
they could lose the election.

1617
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:44,153
Al Qaeda claimed responsibility
through a London newspaper.

1618
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:48,640
Today I spoke to my colleague

1619
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:51,792
the British Home Secretary,

1620
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:56,397
and everyone there has doubts as to
the credibility of the communique.

1621
01:43:57,160 --> 01:44:01,153
The government continues to insist
that ETA is the prime suspect.

1622
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:06,351
There was no reason at the time

1623
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:09,273
for it not to be
the main line of investigation.

1624
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:13,558
Who was it?
Who was it?

1625
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:16,029
11,000,000 people
turn out the next day

1626
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,555
in reaction to the massacre.

1627
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,797
The ETA theory

1628
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,190
loses ground
and the suspicion grows

1629
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:26,432
that it was an Islamic attack

1630
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:29,956
in response to Spairs
participation in the war.

1631
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:43,832
In Barcelona, ministers

1632
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,353
and government party members

1633
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:47,988
are booed and insulted.

1634
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:49,593
Murderers!

1635
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:56,152
Spanish Television supresses

1636
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:59,392
any information
which might lead viewers

1637
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:02,791
into thinking that ETA
did not commit the massacre.

1638
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:05,395
Then it begins cutting off

1639
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:08,597
press conferences with Acebes
whenever he is asked

1640
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,197
about the possibility

1641
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:13,679
of Arabic extremism.

1642
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:18,118
It also ceases to broadcast Otegi's
statement when, on the first day,

1643
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:22,599
Thursday 11th, a few hours after the
attack, he said it had not been ETA.

1644
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:26,559
Who was it?
Who was it?

1645
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:29,388
In front of PP
party headquarters, the people

1646
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:30,993
ask for facts.

1647
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:35,155
Suspects have been arrested.

1648
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,750
None has
any connection with ETA.

1649
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:41,357
We cannot discard anything,

1650
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:45,115
and we have not,
since the time we instructed

1651
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:47,670
the police to continue

1652
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:52,311
investigating every possible lead,
especially the two leads

1653
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:55,119
we had reasons to investigate.

1654
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:58,238
Everyone in Europe knows!

1655
01:45:58,400 --> 01:45:59,913
THAT NIGHT...

1656
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:03,598
Before we vote
we want the truth!

1657
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:09,400
At this very moment,

1658
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:13,599
an illegal and unlawful
demonstration is taking place

1659
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:16,151
around party headquarters

1660
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:19,238
accusing the Popular Party

1661
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:20,799
of serious offenses.

1662
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:26,549
Spanish Television
changes its programming

1663
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:28,836
and screens
"Murder in February,"

1664
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:33,150
a documentary on the attack on the
Basque Socialist Fernando Buesa

1665
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:34,958
and his bodyguard by ETA.

1666
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:39,513
The aim is to link this attack
to the Atocha massacre.

1667
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:42,475
What Spanish Television did was

1668
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:44,710
disinform the people

1669
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:48,793
so that they would go out
and vote on the 14th

1670
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:52,157
without knowing what had happened.
The government was afraid,

1671
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:54,231
the PP was obviously afraid

1672
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:56,709
that if the people
knew it hadrt been ETA

1673
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:59,519
but possibly
some Arab organization

1674
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:03,150
punishing Spain
for its part in the war,

1675
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:05,117
then they would
vote differently.

1676
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:06,679
Liars!

1677
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:09,318
Liars!

1678
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:12,200
The government
reveals the existence

1679
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:15,591
of a video from a radical Islamic
group claiming responsibility.

1680
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:18,320
It has been made

1681
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,357
by someone calling himself

1682
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:23,717
Al Qaeda's
military spokesman in Europe,

1683
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:26,116
Abu Dujan al-Afghani.

1684
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:29,990
This persors identity
has not been confirmed

1685
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:32,628
by the Spanish services

1686
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:36,236
or by the international
intelligence services

1687
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:40,437
we have asked to cooperate
in this matter.

1688
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:44,674
Three days after
the Madrid massacre,

1689
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:48,874
the turnout
of Spanish voters is massive.

1690
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:53,558
Despite all the evidence,

1691
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:55,631
only the government
and its party

1692
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:58,268
continue to maintain
that ETA is responsible.

1693
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:01,478
The priority terrorist
organization is ETA.

1694
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:05,076
Therefore the government's
priority has always been

1695
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:07,595
the terrorist organization ETA,

1696
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:10,593
and as progress has been made
in the investigation,

1697
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:13,593
I have been
keeping you informed.

1698
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:16,035
I think
the Spanish people realized

1699
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:19,431
that this was
just the last lie

1700
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:22,150
in a long series of lies.

1701
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:25,551
And they couldn't take
this because you could lie

1702
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:29,156
about the YAK-42 because no-one
knew exactly what had happened,

1703
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:31,709
but with the impact of 202 dead,

1704
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:35,839
you couldn't lie.
It was an unacceptable lie.

1705
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,592
The last straw.

1706
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:41,548
The Spanish Socialist Party
has won the election.

1707
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:43,358
President!

1708
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:45,670
The ballot boxes
have been very clear.

1709
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:49,113
No war! No war!

1710
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:57,037
Only a handful supporters

1711
01:48:57,200 --> 01:49:00,397
cheered the leaders
of the Popular Party.

1712
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:09,518
Outside Spain,

1713
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:11,796
there is no doubt about it.

1714
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:15,512
Aznar's government lied.

1715
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:19,916
An experiment
that didn't work out.

1716
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:21,718
Oh, well, just too bad.

1717
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:24,838
We'll rest a few days
and then get back to work.

1718
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:41,478
WITH GOOD REASON!

1719
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:45,034
...REASON TO THINK.

1720
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:48,033
THIS FILM WAS MADE POSSIBLE

1721
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:49,872
BY THE PEOPLE WHO
GENEROUSLY SUPPORTED IT

1722
01:49:50,120 --> 01:49:52,953
SOME OF THEM ARE
NOT INCLUDED IN THE CREDITS

1723
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:54,553
FOR FEAR OF REPRISALS

1724
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:57,633
OUR THANKS TO THEM ALL

1725
01:49:58,305 --> 01:50:04,500
