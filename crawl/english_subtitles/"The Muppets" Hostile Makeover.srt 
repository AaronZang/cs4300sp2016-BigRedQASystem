1
00:00:04,641 --> 00:00:05,707
Sign his card.

2
00:00:05,775 --> 00:00:06,975
I'm not signing.

3
00:00:07,042 --> 00:00:10,578
Birthdays are just a bogus holiday
created by greeting-card companies.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,915
Hey, be nice. No dirty drawings.

5
00:00:13,983 --> 00:00:15,383
Oh.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,585
Maybe I can make it into a saxophone.

7
00:00:17,653 --> 00:00:19,420
Give me that. Give me that.

8
00:00:19,488 --> 00:00:21,322
I am a writer. I will sign for all of us.

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,356
Stand back!

10
00:00:26,628 --> 00:00:29,330
Wow! That is very impressive.

11
00:00:29,398 --> 00:00:30,730
Oh, you should see me in the shower.

12
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:33,267
- 10 seconds...
- In, out, everything's clean.

13
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:36,770
Hey, guys! You're not gonna believe this.

14
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:40,707
I just got an e-vite to a
party at Jay Leno's house!

15
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:43,277
Oh, I get those spam e-mails all the time.

16
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:46,746
You know, from my
"mother" who's "stuck overseas,"

17
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:48,048
"needs money."

18
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:49,382
You just delete them.

19
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,118
Uh, Gonzo, isn't your
mother on a South American cruise?

20
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:54,086
Yeah, and I'm a little worried. I
haven't heard from her in a while.

21
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:56,723
No, no, this is real.
I know Jay Leno!

22
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,958
We met last month at a
celebrity golf tournament.

23
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:01,628
Kermit! We got a big problem with Piggy!

24
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,829
She's... there's a...

25
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,431
Scooter, Scooter, listen. Relax, relax.

26
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,132
We talked about overreacting to things.

27
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,367
- It's a code red.
- Aah! Code red!

28
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:08,601
Oh, my God!

29
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:09,936
This is not a drill!

30
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:15,474
We've created a color-coded
alert system to track Piggy's moods.

31
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:16,775
Green... she's calm.

32
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:19,078
But we've never been at green.

33
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:20,880
Yellow... she's in tears.

34
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,748
Orange... I'm in tears.

35
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:25,985
But with a code red, if she locks eyes
with you, it's already too late.

36
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:29,421
Who replaced my thick
sharpies with fine-tipped sharpies?!

37
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,225
I'm signing autographs, not
writing the Bible on a grain of rice!

38
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,892
I have a feeling this
isn't about pen thickness.

39
00:01:35,127 --> 00:01:37,796
So, I was fitting Piggy for a new dress...

40
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:38,997
Oh, no, no. You forgot to cut out the tag?

41
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,833
- She knows her size?!
- Oh, please.

42
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,569
I've woven such a cocoon of lies,

43
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:46,839
she doesn't know her size, weight,
or even how old she is.

44
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,474
Look at this nonsense!

45
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,477
Pencils, highlighters, a backscratcher?!

46
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,612
If you're itchy, take care of it at home!

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,747
What is going on?

48
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,648
The People's Choice Awards are coming up,

49
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,250
and she doesn't have a date.

50
00:01:58,317 --> 00:02:00,952
Shocking. She seems
like such pleasant company.

51
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:04,455
How dare you try to
calm me down with cake?!

52
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:06,024
Give me that cake!

53
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,293
W-wait here.

54
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:11,529
Clear.

55
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:14,465
Oh.

56
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:16,701
Whoa!

57
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,170
I tried to offer her a ballpoint.

58
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,776
You've got to find that pig a date.

59
00:02:25,843 --> 00:02:27,811
Mm-hmm.

65
00:02:47,898 --> 00:02:50,866
You know, um, my
optometrist would love to date Piggy,

66
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:52,568
and he's pretty attractive.

67
00:02:52,636 --> 00:02:55,004
At least I think he
is. My glasses aren't very good.

68
00:02:55,072 --> 00:02:56,739
It can't be just anybody, Scooter.

69
00:02:56,807 --> 00:02:59,742
She needs to walk down that red
carpet with somebody famous.

70
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,644
- Hmm.
- Somebody that makes her look good.

71
00:03:01,711 --> 00:03:03,679
So, where are we with Jeff Goldblum?

72
00:03:03,747 --> 00:03:05,314
On with Goldblum's peoples now.

73
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:08,751
I'm not just gonna book a
random famous guy and hope for sparks.

74
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,554
I have an edge because Piggy's
my ex-girlfriend,

75
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:15,891
and, uh, when we were dating, we had
one of those free-pass lists, you know?

76
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,326
It was just for fun.

77
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:19,728
Well, I mean, unless Lea Thompson and I

78
00:03:19,796 --> 00:03:21,530
got stuck in an elevator together.

79
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:23,866
Hmm.

80
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:25,567
Holding, holding.

81
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:26,601
Yeah?

82
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:28,002
Goldblum's married!

83
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,271
Wait, wait, wait,
wait. Happily married?

84
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:31,706
Aw, rats.

85
00:03:31,774 --> 00:03:33,875
Hey! There's a rat sittin' right here!

86
00:03:33,943 --> 00:03:36,243
Ah, don't be so sensitive.
You guys started The Plague.

87
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:39,113
Okay, guys, throw
everything we've got at Keanu Reeves.

88
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:40,515
Got it.

89
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:41,916
Keanu Reeves says he's in.

90
00:03:41,984 --> 00:03:43,250
Oh, no, no.

91
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:44,919
Oh, he's put on 100 pounds.

92
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:47,287
He's doing a movie about that
Hawaiian ukulele player.

93
00:03:47,355 --> 00:03:49,189
Hey, guys! Hey, guys!

94
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:50,591
It's that time of year again.

95
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:52,425
I'm selling cookies for my daughter's troop

96
00:03:52,494 --> 00:03:54,094
so she can win a mountain bike.

97
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:58,465
We are only interested if
you've got a box of dreamy dates.

98
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:01,234
Ooh! Well, uh, uh, the
fudge-alongs have raisins.

99
00:04:01,302 --> 00:04:02,302
I mean, they're not dates,

100
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,971
but they are also a sun-dried fruit.

101
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:04,938
Not now, Bobo.

102
00:04:05,006 --> 00:04:06,106
Oh. No problem.

103
00:04:06,173 --> 00:04:09,141
I'll just take the battery out of
your car to remind you to come see me.

104
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:10,910
- Yeah.
- Hey!

105
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:12,444
Let's call Josh Groban next.

106
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:15,781
He's single, he's got a great voice,
and he gives me the feels.

107
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:18,651
He gives me the feels, too!

108
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:23,322
What?

109
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,158
He's a handsome man, and gender is fluid.

110
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:27,727
All right, so,
what do you say, boss?

111
00:04:27,794 --> 00:04:30,262
I book Josh Groban on the
show and we hope for the best?

112
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,998
I think we can do better than hope.

113
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:34,900
Kermit has cooked up some kind of plan

114
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:37,636
to make the Grobans and Piggy
fall in love during the music.

115
00:04:37,703 --> 00:04:39,804
It's a stupid idea, but I love it.

116
00:04:40,873 --> 00:04:43,775

123

124

Whoo!

130
00:05:58,548 --> 00:06:00,083
Did you just say "whoo"?

131
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,351
What? I'm allowed to feel things.

132
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:03,486
Hm.

133
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:10,025
As a newsman, I report
on a world full of famine and war.

134
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:12,767
But you guys buying
cookies for my daughter will

135
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:15,355
show her that the
human spirit is still alive.

136
00:06:15,398 --> 00:06:19,535
Plus, every box I sell makes
me look better than my ex-wife.

137
00:06:19,603 --> 00:06:21,036
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Oh!

138
00:06:21,104 --> 00:06:22,571
What are you doing here?

139
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,774
You got a whole news
building across the street to sell to.

140
00:06:25,842 --> 00:06:28,075
Gentle newsman confronted by large bear.

141
00:06:28,144 --> 00:06:30,111
Will he allow himself to be intimidated?

142
00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:31,846
The answer... coming up...

143
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:33,047
E-e-eh...
now!

144
00:06:33,115 --> 00:06:34,182
Ohhhh!

145
00:06:36,452 --> 00:06:38,286
Good morning, everybody.

146
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:41,022
So sorry I'm a little
late, but for some reason,

147
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:43,391
it's just so hard to get
out of bed these days.

148
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:45,760
Der piggan de gropin' de Groban.

149
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:48,195
Oh, chef! You have a naughty mind.

150
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:49,796
But accurate.

151
00:06:50,865 --> 00:06:52,032
- Oh, kermie.
- Yeah?

152
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:53,700
Can you come by my
dressing room for a moment?

153
00:06:53,768 --> 00:06:55,269
Whenever you get a sec. No rush.

154
00:06:55,336 --> 00:06:56,936
Sure.

155
00:06:57,004 --> 00:06:59,273
Now, I'm not saying that
I solved everything

156
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,376
because Josh took Piggy to
the People's Choice Awards,

157
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:06,913
but if they ever build an
executive producers hall of fame...

158
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:10,150
I think you'll be entering
through the Kermit the frog pavilion.

159
00:07:10,217 --> 00:07:11,517
Hmm-hmm! Hm.

160
00:07:12,653 --> 00:07:14,087
- Beaker!
- Aah!

161
00:07:14,155 --> 00:07:15,989
Did you get a haircut?

162
00:07:16,057 --> 00:07:17,057
Unh-unh.

163
00:07:17,124 --> 00:07:18,958
Well, don't. It's the perfect length.

164
00:07:19,026 --> 00:07:20,326
You look cute as a button.

165
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:22,696
Mnnnnn!

166
00:07:22,763 --> 00:07:24,898
I mean, since
they've been going out,

167
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:28,301
I've been waking up to the sound
of my alarm instead of my own screams.

168
00:07:28,368 --> 00:07:29,802
Do you know what that means?

169
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:32,004
For the first time
ever, we're at a code green!

170
00:07:32,072 --> 00:07:34,574
Yaaaaaay!

171
00:07:35,642 --> 00:07:38,244
So, Josh was over last night.

172
00:07:38,312 --> 00:07:41,247
And we were cuddled up on
the couch, watching the show.

173
00:07:41,315 --> 00:07:42,448
Thanks for that picture.

174
00:07:42,516 --> 00:07:44,317
Anyway, he has some ideas.

175
00:07:44,384 --> 00:07:45,517
What? About the music?

176
00:07:45,585 --> 00:07:48,020
That man is more than just a musician.

177
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:49,287
Way more.

178
00:07:49,355 --> 00:07:51,523
Yeah, yeah, I get it...
He's a world-class cuddler.

179
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:54,193
I meant he's also a producer.

180
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,962
And he thinks I could be presented

181
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,165
in a smarter, more sophisticated way.

182
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:02,134
Like, I could interview authors.

183
00:08:02,202 --> 00:08:04,369
Piggy, I suggested bringing on an author.

184
00:08:04,437 --> 00:08:06,003
I even gave you her book.

185
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:07,605
And I'm halfway through.

186
00:08:07,672 --> 00:08:09,173
That was five years ago. She's dead now.

187
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:11,375
Oh, good. I don't have to finish it.

188
00:08:11,443 --> 00:08:14,045
Look, Piggy, you want an
author, I'll get you an author.

189
00:08:14,113 --> 00:08:15,412
- Oh. One more thing.
- Yeah?

190
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,149
Josh and I were
thinking... And I agree with us...

191
00:08:18,217 --> 00:08:21,352
That it would be divine if
the band went acoustic.

192
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,820
Acoustic? They're called the
Electric Mayhem.

193
00:08:23,888 --> 00:08:26,022
Yeah, yeah, I know, but our audience

194
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:31,128
needs a gentler, more tranquil
vibe at night to help them sleep...

195
00:08:31,195 --> 00:08:33,329
Like a warm glass of milk.

196
00:08:33,397 --> 00:08:36,032
This is a television
show! It is not a glass of milk!

197
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,202
Don't you think if we
tried, it can be both?

198
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,670
Well... we...

199
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:42,906
Oh! A loose thread!

200
00:08:42,974 --> 00:08:44,039
Milk?

201
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,342
Ooh! Uh, you want some cookies with that?

202
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,344
Oh! Yummy cookies!

203
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,247
The Electric Mayhem, everybody.

204
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,510
What was that one called, Dr. Teeth?

205
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:17,412
- "Dead inside."
- Mm-hmm.

206
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,247
- We wrote it today.
- Yeah.

207
00:09:19,315 --> 00:09:21,182
Mm. Very sophisticated.

208
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,319
And we're back, with author Reza Aslan.

209
00:09:24,387 --> 00:09:27,489
Reza, tell me... you
write so eloquently about History.

210
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:29,123
Where do you get your ideas?

211
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:31,559
Oh, well, it's History,

212
00:09:31,627 --> 00:09:33,695
so these are things that
have actually happened.

213
00:09:33,763 --> 00:09:37,432
So you don't use your
imagination. That's fascinating.

214
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,701
A little lazy... But fascinating!

215
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:43,004
You know, when I read a magazine...

216
00:09:43,071 --> 00:09:44,672
My mother's stuck in a jungle somewhere,

217
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:46,540
and, yet, I know she's
having a better time.

218
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:49,343
Does it make you angry

219
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:52,613
that libraries are giving
away your book for free?

220
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:56,017
You get nothing, while
libraries make millions?

221
00:09:56,084 --> 00:09:57,451
I don't... Think that's right.

222
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,020
I totally agree.

223
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:02,488
The libraries have had
it too good for too long!

224
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,464
I can't believe this.

225
00:10:11,532 --> 00:10:16,036
I'm inside Jay Leno's house,
and nobody's calling the cops!

226
00:10:16,103 --> 00:10:17,403
Oh!

227
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,405
Look at this! Look at
this! Are you getting this?

228
00:10:19,473 --> 00:10:21,674
It's Jay Leno's notebook.

229
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:27,246
I bet all of his amazing
jokes are written in here.

230
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:28,514
Oh!

231
00:10:30,584 --> 00:10:32,318
"Call exterminator."

232
00:10:32,386 --> 00:10:34,554
"Make doctor's appointment."

233
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:37,423
I mean, two great set-ups right there!

234
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:40,859
He probably keeps his
punchlines in another book...

235
00:10:40,926 --> 00:10:42,694
You know, for security reasons.

236
00:10:42,762 --> 00:10:44,429
Fozzie! You made it!

237
00:10:44,497 --> 00:10:45,831
Oh, wow!

238
00:10:45,898 --> 00:10:47,999
That means a lot coming from you, Jay.

239
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:49,401
So, look... If people ask,

240
00:10:49,469 --> 00:10:52,371
am I allowed to say I went to
my friend Jay Leno's house?

241
00:10:52,438 --> 00:10:55,440
- I mean, we're friends, right?
- Of course we're friends.

242
00:10:55,508 --> 00:10:58,410
Look at me! I'm best
friends with Jay Leno!

243
00:10:58,478 --> 00:10:59,711
Come here, you!

244
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:01,112
Yeah! Oh!

245
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,013
Hey, hey, you're getting fur on my pants.

246
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:05,015
You kiddin'? I'm getting
Jay Leno on my fur!

247
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,551
Boy, this guy is great. He's
like the comeback kid.

248
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:09,119
Hey, listen.

249
00:11:09,187 --> 00:11:11,389
Check out the bathroom in the entranceway.

250
00:11:11,456 --> 00:11:12,456
- Yeah?
- All right?

251
00:11:12,524 --> 00:11:13,957
It's one of those Japanese deals.

252
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:16,394
Does everything for you. It's unbelievable.

253
00:11:16,461 --> 00:11:18,763
I'll make sure to drink a
lot of water while I'm here, too!

254
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,731
Yeah!

255
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,299
Ohh!

256
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:24,801
I was just talking toilets with Jay Leno!

257
00:11:24,869 --> 00:11:27,136
Oh! I never want this day to end!

258
00:11:28,205 --> 00:11:29,672
I need a souvenir.

259
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:45,186
Morning meeting, everybody.

260
00:11:45,254 --> 00:11:47,255
- Here you go. Thank you for your patronage.
- Morning meeting.

261
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:48,724
Morning meet...

262
00:11:50,693 --> 00:11:52,594
Seriously?

263
00:11:52,662 --> 00:11:54,496
You actually came back?

264
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:57,466
Yes, I did, and for
more on this breaking story,

265
00:11:57,534 --> 00:11:59,468
let's go to me, outside!

266
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:01,202
What...

267
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,439
You know, you're supposed to buy cookies
from me, not him.

268
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:05,706
I'm new!

269
00:12:05,774 --> 00:12:08,310
I don't understand the
politics around here!

270
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:10,345
Ahhhm! Num-num-num-num!

271
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:11,546
Ahhhm!

272
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:14,316
Morning meeting,
everybody. Morning meeting.

273
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:15,650
Interesting.

274
00:12:15,717 --> 00:12:17,618
Jay Leno's candy dish.

275
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:20,322
Oh! If this candy dish could talk...

276
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:21,756
Yeah, you would have a talking candy dish,

277
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,690
and maybe that would have
been impressive, okay?

278
00:12:23,758 --> 00:12:25,492
You're not worried about getting caught?

279
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,128
Those rich people have security
cameras everywhere!

280
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:30,297
Yeah, but he wouldn't care about a bowl.

281
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:32,933
I mean, he probably put it
out so I would take it.

282
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:35,602
What about that theory, huh? Eh? Eh?

283
00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:37,537
Eh?

284
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:39,039
Huh?

285
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:40,975
Oh, God!

286
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:42,375
Good morning, everybody.

287
00:12:42,443 --> 00:12:44,010
- Oh, buenos dias.
- Good morning, Kermit.

288
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,114
Hey, guys, listen, I know that, uh,
last night's show was... pretty awful.

289
00:12:48,182 --> 00:12:48,948
- Yeah.
- Yes, it was.

290
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:50,450
But that one's on me.

291
00:12:50,517 --> 00:12:52,952
I set Piggy up with that horrible, evil...

292
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,356
Incredibly talented, velvet-throated
piano god.

293
00:12:56,423 --> 00:12:57,357
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

294
00:12:57,424 --> 00:13:00,026
But don't worry. Tonight,
I'm getting rid of Groban.

295
00:13:00,094 --> 00:13:01,227
- What?!
- No, no, no!

296
00:13:01,295 --> 00:13:02,528
Don't get rid of Groban!

297
00:13:02,596 --> 00:13:04,196
Why not? He's ruining the show.

298
00:13:04,263 --> 00:13:05,263
Oh, that's true.

299
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:07,565
Quality-wise, the show was prison sushi.

300
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:11,036
Ah, but the rest of the
day with Piggy being all chill?

301
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:12,871
That was gas-station sushi.

302
00:13:12,938 --> 00:13:15,707
And we love us some gas-station sushi!

303
00:13:15,774 --> 00:13:16,741
All right!

304
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:20,245
Oh, yeah, Piggy's been so great, I've
been skipping my pre-show cry.

305
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:21,646
You pre-show cry?!

306
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:23,981
Animal pre-show cry!

307
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:25,182
Wait a minute. W-what are you saying?

308
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,151
You actually want Groban to stick around?

309
00:13:27,219 --> 00:13:28,285
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

310
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:30,687
Listen to what she
wrote in my birthday card.

311
00:13:30,755 --> 00:13:34,658
"Your presence is like
a glissando in my heart,

312
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:37,561
cascading sunshine into my soul.

313
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:38,595
Piggy."

314
00:13:38,663 --> 00:13:39,696
Really?

315
00:13:39,764 --> 00:13:43,166
Last year, all she wrote on my card
was "large vanilla latte, extra foam."

316
00:13:43,234 --> 00:13:44,767
Yes, but, see, that's our Piggy.

317
00:13:44,835 --> 00:13:48,338
You know, what she wrote in his card
is Piggy under the influence of Groban.

318
00:13:48,406 --> 00:13:49,572
- Hm.
- Hm.

319
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,675
I can't let this happen,
guys. I got to get her back.

320
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:58,348
Hey, there's, like, 20 of
us. Why didn't we stop him?

321
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,715
Hmm.

322
00:13:59,783 --> 00:14:02,584
Perhaps our happiness has made us too soft.

323
00:14:02,652 --> 00:14:04,286
- Ooh.
- Interesting.

324
00:14:05,788 --> 00:14:07,722
- Hey, you!
- Whaa! Dyaah!

325
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:12,061
- You got a message from Jay Leno.
- Oh. Uh, d... okay.

326
00:14:12,128 --> 00:14:13,395
What did he say?

327
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:16,098
He said he wants to see you at his house!

328
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,966
Was he mad, or is that just you?

329
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:21,702
I take messages. I don't judge tone!

330
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:30,278
- Yes?
- Oh!

331
00:14:30,345 --> 00:14:33,047
Uh, what are you... W-where's Piggy?

332
00:14:33,115 --> 00:14:35,716
Oh, she's, um, right in the middle of
getting a hot-stone massage right now.

333
00:14:35,784 --> 00:14:36,817
Can I help you?

334
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:38,419
Ah, warm. That feels good.

335
00:14:38,487 --> 00:14:39,220
Piggy?

336
00:14:39,288 --> 00:14:40,821
I-I got to talk to her.

337
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:44,225
Oh, anything you need to say to
my lady, you can say to me.

338
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:45,659
Okay, then. Fine.

339
00:14:45,727 --> 00:14:47,594
The guy you're dating is
an absolute nightmare,

340
00:14:47,661 --> 00:14:49,563
- and you got to get rid of him.
- Oh, yeah?!

341
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,566
Well, you're a little insecure swamp rat
who doesn't know what he's talking about!

342
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:53,766
Uh...

343
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:56,236
That was her response to you,
not mine. I think you're terrific.

344
00:14:56,304 --> 00:14:58,171
Would you stop trying
to turn Piggy into you?

345
00:14:58,239 --> 00:15:01,841
I... wouldn't the world be a better
place if everybody was a little more like me?

346
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:04,444
- Out of my way, dork. I'm going in.
- I don't think so.

347
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:06,480
Oh, you don't think so? Really? Really?

348
00:15:06,547 --> 00:15:10,416
Because I think you're
forgetting that I am a frog, and I can jump!

349
00:15:13,353 --> 00:15:14,786
Ouch!

350
00:15:16,723 --> 00:15:17,889
See ya, frog.

351
00:15:17,957 --> 00:15:20,292
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow! Hot rocks! Hot rocks!

352
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,327
Get them off!

353
00:15:22,762 --> 00:15:25,797
Somebody cookin' de bacon.

354
00:15:26,478 --> 00:15:29,396
Look, I know what I did was wrong,

355
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:32,131
and there's only one
way to make things right.

356
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,568
I'm just gonna sneak it back in.

357
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:36,503
Jay will never even know I was th...

358
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:41,106
Okay. That's a setback.

359
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,240
Fozzie. Take a seat.

360
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,109
Uh... take it?

361
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,811
I t... I... I don't take things.

362
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,981
E-e-especially things that
don't belong to me.

363
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:55,053
So I will sit in the seat,
good sir, but I will not take it.

364
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,323
Look, I don't know what
you're on, but listen.

365
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:02,360
How would you like to open for
me next week in Las Vegas?

366
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,429
W-wait. That's why I'm here?

367
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:06,898
Well, yeah. You're one of the good guys.

368
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,266
You're not one of these guys that,
you know, steals my stuff.

369
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:11,936
Steals your stuff? W-what
do you mean by that?

370
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,473
My jokes... my material. You don't t...

371
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,041
Oh! Right!

372
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:20,277
No, of course not. I-I never steal jokes!

373
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:21,278
Jokes... never!

374
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:24,781
- So you'll do it?
- Open for Jay Leno?

375
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:26,349
- Yeah.
- That's my dream!

376
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:28,351
Great. I'll get some
champagne. We'll celebrate.

377
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:29,786
Okay!

378
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:35,291
This is one of the
greatest moments of my life!

379
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:38,495
I wish I had a...
souvenir to remember this day.

380
00:16:54,245 --> 00:16:56,379
What are you doing with my brass rooster?

381
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:58,581
Uh... duh...

382
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:02,419
I have a brass chicken at
home, and they... belong together?

383
00:17:02,486 --> 00:17:04,820
Look, son, we all have idols.

384
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:07,557
I've never told anybody this before, but...

385
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:11,393
I once took a candy dish from
George Carlin's house.

386
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:15,431
I wasn't proud of it.
In fact, I-I still have it.

387
00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:17,499
It's... It's right over here.

388
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:24,574
Where's my George Carlin candy dish?

389
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:26,442
It was gone when I got here.

390
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,511
You stole my George Carlin candy dish?

391
00:17:32,748 --> 00:17:34,549
You know something,
son? You got a problem. Okay?

392
00:17:34,617 --> 00:17:35,984
Get out. Get out.

393
00:17:38,153 --> 00:17:39,220
Oh!

394
00:17:39,288 --> 00:17:40,521
This is a nice pen. Can I have...

395
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,523
- Get out!
- Okay! Yes, yes, yes!

396
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:47,862
Sometimes, when I'm really
frustrated and need to clear my head,

397
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:51,232
I just get into my golf
cart and floor it around the lot.

398
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,601
Speed limit's 5 miles per
hour, but I'll go 6 or 7.

399
00:17:53,668 --> 00:17:54,602
I don't care.

400
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:55,869
Hey!

401
00:17:55,937 --> 00:17:57,638
Ooh! Ooh! Oh, my goodness!

402
00:17:57,706 --> 00:17:58,939
Watch where you're going, frog.

403
00:17:59,007 --> 00:18:01,309
O-o-oh, I'm sorry,
Laurence. Uh, uh...

404
00:18:01,376 --> 00:18:03,444
Hey, hey, when are you
gonna come do the show?

405
00:18:03,512 --> 00:18:06,447
Well, if it keeps on sucking
the way it did last night, never!!

406
00:18:08,116 --> 00:18:10,751
Uh, yeah, good to see you, too.

407
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:12,152
Good grief.

408
00:18:13,454 --> 00:18:15,589
I feel like everything is slipping away...

409
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:18,892
The show, Piggy... My vertical leap.

410
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:23,463
But if this is who she
wants to be, what can I do?

411
00:18:23,531 --> 00:18:26,767
It's her life. It's her show.

412
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,304
Hmm.

413
00:18:31,372 --> 00:18:33,973
Maybe I need to remind her of that.

414
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,742
Hmm.

415
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:36,909
- Hey, Kermit.
- Yeah?

416
00:18:36,977 --> 00:18:39,979
I just want to say I'm sorry about
what I said about your show sucking.

417
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:41,047
Yeah?

418
00:18:41,115 --> 00:18:42,616
I just had a really rough night.

419
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:44,083
Oh, I'm sorry. What happened?

420
00:18:44,152 --> 00:18:46,586
I watched your show, and it sucked!

421
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:59,032
Yeah, "Up Late with
Miss Piggy"! What do you want?!

422
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:00,199
Hey, Bobo!

423
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:01,701
- Hmm?
- How you doing, buddy?

424
00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:03,836
How are those cookie
sales coming along, huh?

425
00:19:03,904 --> 00:19:05,138
Lousy.

426
00:19:05,205 --> 00:19:08,708
But it did turn out to be a
teaching opportunity for my daughter.

427
00:19:08,776 --> 00:19:12,044
"If you want
something, don't count on Dad."

428
00:19:12,111 --> 00:19:14,613
Well, uh, have you checked with the band?

429
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:17,516
Uh, I bet, uh, they'd be
happy to buy your cookies.

430
00:19:17,584 --> 00:19:19,618
Hey, hey, hey, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

431
00:19:19,686 --> 00:19:21,320
Those guys are always happy!

432
00:19:21,388 --> 00:19:23,355
Yeah. Legally now.

433
00:19:27,194 --> 00:19:28,394
More boxes! More boxes!

434
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:29,728
Oh! Here you go, animal.

435
00:19:29,796 --> 00:19:31,563
"More boxes"?

436
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,199
Screw the mountain bike. My
daughter's getting a prius.

437
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:38,036
- Anybody got any...
- Whoa!

438
00:19:38,104 --> 00:19:38,837
Whoa!

439
00:19:38,905 --> 00:19:39,871
Uh-oh.

440
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:44,542
Where are we going,
Kermit? You can just tell us.

441
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,644
No, it's a surprise.

442
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:49,847
Listen, guys, I wanted to do
something to make up for how I acted.

443
00:19:49,915 --> 00:19:52,817
See, I-I realize that,
Josh, you do have vision.

444
00:19:52,884 --> 00:19:56,221
And do you know what word
you can't spell without "vision"?

445
00:19:56,288 --> 00:19:57,722
"Visions."

446
00:19:57,789 --> 00:19:58,856
No.

447
00:19:58,924 --> 00:20:00,057
W-well, yes, yes, yes, that's true.

448
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,892
But... but I was going for "television."

449
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,231
And, Piggy, your television show has
changed for the better because of this man.

450
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:10,267
And that kind of contribution should
not go unrewarded, right?

451
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:13,670
Okay, guys. What do you think?!

452
00:20:13,738 --> 00:20:15,205
_

453
00:20:15,273 --> 00:20:16,406
I-I love it.

454
00:20:16,474 --> 00:20:17,608
Right?!

455
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,676
Oh, and, Piggy, the best
part is that even though

456
00:20:19,744 --> 00:20:22,045
you're the only female
host on late-night, it shows

457
00:20:22,113 --> 00:20:25,549
you're brave enough to say, "I
can't do it without a man."

458
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:29,785
Hmm.

459
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,220
Bye-bye.

460
00:20:32,756 --> 00:20:36,292
Sometimes, with couples,
when one person is very powerful,

461
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,362
they make the other
person change who they are.

462
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:42,931
That's what I was doing to Josh.

463
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:46,498
So I let him go. Next!

464
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,683
Uh... you're...

465
00:20:57,751 --> 00:20:59,819
You're Lea Thompson, aren't you?

466
00:20:59,887 --> 00:21:00,820
All my life.

467
00:21:00,888 --> 00:21:02,722
Oh, god, it's happening.

468
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:04,858
- Uh, I-I-I-I-I'm Kermit the frog.
- Good news! They found my mother!

469
00:21:04,925 --> 00:21:06,625
- Huh?
- You got to hear the story, Kermit!

470
00:21:06,693 --> 00:21:08,627
No, no, no, I can hear it tomorrow,
Gonzo... t-tomorrow.

471
00:21:08,695 --> 00:21:10,229
- Oh, no, no, no, it's really amazing.
- W...

472
00:21:10,296 --> 00:21:11,897
I'll just ride down with you.

473
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:13,899
So, the cruise ship has this expedition

474
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:15,835
where you ride goats up Machu Picchu.
