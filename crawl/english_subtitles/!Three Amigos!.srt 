694
01:04:28,282 --> 01:04:31,035
Could it be because you are turning 40 today?

No.

to sleep in her cell instead of with you?

In Germany, the cinema is very popular.

874

I have seen all of your films,

875
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:43,405
including when you were known as
Little Neddy Knickers.

876
01:19:44,114 --> 01:19:46,408
Well, that was a long time ago.

877
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:50,620
It was this man who inspired me
to learn the art of the quick draw.

878
01:19:50,704 --> 01:19:53,623
I looked up to this man.
I studied his every move.

879
01:19:53,707 --> 01:19:56,918
It was my dream
to be as fast as Ned Nederlander.

880
01:19:57,544 --> 01:20:00,297
I practiced every day for hours and hours.

881
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,215
He was a god to me.

882
01:20:02,382 --> 01:20:05,635
A god? Well, I don't know about that.

883
01:20:05,719 --> 01:20:09,431
But it is nice to meet a fan.
You know, often I think...

884
01:20:09,514 --> 01:20:11,975
Then, I found out about movie tricks.

885
01:20:12,058 --> 01:20:14,311
Trick photography. I was crushed.

886
01:20:14,436 --> 01:20:16,062
I never used trick photography.

887
01:20:16,313 --> 01:20:19,816
That is impossible.
No one can be as fast as you appear to be.

888
01:20:20,233 --> 01:20:21,610
I am that fast.

889

01:30:06,986 --> 01:30:10,031
- Do you think it could work?
- It's got to work.

983
01:30:10,490 --> 01:30:12,158
It's our only hope.

984
01:30:58,496 --> 01:31:01,624
Sew, very old one. Sew like the wind.

985
01:31:08,422 --> 01:31:10,299
Okay, dig here.

986
01:31:50,131 --> 01:31:51,132
(LAUGHS EVILLY)

987
01:32:14,614 --> 01:32:15,990
Yoo-hoo!

988
01:32:19,285 --> 01:32:20,786
Where are you?

989
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,121
(GUNS FIRE)

990
01:32:23,456 --> 01:32:25,458
There they are, El Guapo!

991
01:32:35,635 --> 01:32:37,220
Now they're over there, El Guapo.

992
01:32:42,975 --> 01:32:44,727
Now they're over there.

993
01:32:46,979 --> 01:32:48,314
Shoot them!

994
01:32:50,274 --> 01:32:51,275
They're over there.

995
01:32:55,071 --> 01:32:56,948
Now they're over here.

996
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:06,832
EL GUAPO: What the hell
is happening around here?

997
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:09,168
Shoot, shoot!

998
01:33:11,087 --> 01:33:13,714
JEFE: Now they're over there,
on top of the church.

999
01:33:15,091 --> 01:33:17,343
El Guapo, they are everywhere.

1000
01:33:18,386 --> 01:33:19,512
They're over there, too.

1001
01:33:31,148 --> 01:33:32,275

1003
01:33:45,371 --> 01:33:47,290
Come back, you cowards!

1004
01:33:48,207 --> 01:33:49,750
You traitors!

1005
01:33:53,254 --> 01:33:55,256
I'm still here, El Guapo.

1006
01:34:12,398 --> 01:34:14,066
You stupid horse!

1007
01:35:01,405 --> 01:35:03,407
That was some good trick.

1008
01:35:07,036 --> 01:35:09,914
Come closer. I have something to tell you.

1009
01:35:18,422 --> 01:35:19,423
-(SCREAMING)
-(EL GUAPO LAUGHING)

1010
01:35:20,299 --> 01:35:22,343
That was a good trick, too.

1011
01:35:22,468 --> 01:35:23,844
(LAUGHING)

1012
01:35:32,353 --> 01:35:34,814
I'm gonna miss you, senor Dusty.

1013
01:35:40,152 --> 01:35:41,612
I'm gonna miss you, too, Pablo.

1014
01:35:43,781 --> 01:35:47,118
Here, I want you to have my watch.

1015
01:35:57,711 --> 01:35:59,505
I wanna go with you.

1016
01:36:00,589 --> 01:36:05,177
No, Pablo, there's still much to be done here.
Your village needs you.

1017
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:07,513
And your family needs you.

1018
01:36:08,556 --> 01:36:10,558
We are men without homes.

1019
01:36:11,725 --> 01:36:13,352
We were meant to wander.

1020
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:18,023
You will always have a home
here with us in Santa Poco.

1021
01:36:21,235 --> 01:36:22,778
Goodbye, Dusty.

1022
01:36:28,826 --> 01:36:31,287
You have done what you said you would do.

1023
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:35,416
Long will the memory of the Three Amigos
live in the hearts of the people of Santa P000.

1024
01:36:51,724 --> 01:36:53,142
I'll come back one day.

1025
01:36:54,059 --> 01:36:55,060
VVhy?

1026
01:36:57,980 --> 01:37:01,066
Well, I thought that maybe you and I could...

1027
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:04,403
Oh.

NED: Here, I'll take that.

1035
01:38:14,765 --> 01:38:18,102
Our reward is that justice has been done.

1036
01:38:21,814 --> 01:38:25,526
And remember, wherever there is injustice,
you will find us.

1037
01:38:26,235 --> 01:38:28,946
Wherever there is suffering, we'll be there.
