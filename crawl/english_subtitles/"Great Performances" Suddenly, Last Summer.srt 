6
00:03:44,926 --> 00:03:47,895
When I made mine? Last movie
about surfing, in 1964 ...

7
00:03:48,597 --> 00:03:51,794
people surfed
in just four pa? ses.

8
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:55,460
Today, surfers catch waves
All pa? ifs ...

9
00:03:55,604 --> 00:03:57,128
that t? m coast ...

10
00:03:57,272 --> 00:04:00,503
and in almost all the islands,
in all oceans.

11
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,508
If you? sought
the perfect wave ...

12
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,177
and was everywhere,
All pa? ifs ...

you? would be out
for 50 years.

15
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,849
In the age of the longboard, the perfect wave
was the '' break point '', as in Malibu.

16
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:22,753
Now it depends on the type
board do you? surf ...

17
00:04:22,897 --> 00:04:25,525
and wave to you? like best.

People with weights

23
00:04:57,265 --> 00:05:00,496
and little children
really trust the parents.

24
00:05:08,043 --> 00:05:09,670

He thinks the partner a fool
that always pushes out.

30
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:48,883
It would be safer
in his pr?'d put board.

31
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:56,557
He? the only one that fits
that wetsuit ...

32
00:05:56,758 --> 00:05:58,726
bought a net ?? the.

33
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:01,722
He do not get tired.

34
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:04,832
He is there?
the rest of the day.

35
00:06:07,202 --> 00:06:11,502
In the 20s and 30s, surfers
used wooden planks.

36
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:17,508
In the 50s, the boards were
made of wood, fiberglass and balsa.

37
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:23,844
In the 60s,
polyurethane and fiberglass.

38
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:27,021
In the 70s,
the shortboard came on the scene.

39
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:32,182
? But one thing paragraph changed:
a mistake ? always a mistake.

40
00:07:00,355 --> 00:07:04,314
Now people catch waves with
all sorts of things, jet-skies ...

41
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:07,654
canoes equipped ...

at? kayaks.

43
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:15,002
I bet this guy would rather
I have been in the river.

44
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:21,334
Windsurfers can do
stunts in the surf.

45
00:07:26,548 --> 00:07:30,507
My friend Tom Morey invented
a boogie board in 1 97 1.

46
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:33,513
Today it seems everyone

47
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:38,355
Some almost made it
an art form, as Mike Stewart.

48
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:56,270
He takes that thing
t? o within the wave ...

49
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:59,039
what? 's hard to believe
that can come out the other side.

Mike and his friends surfing
Waimea Bay.

51
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,160
Exciting waves breaking
almost on the beach.

52
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,359
When the sea est? calm,
they'll to Rio Waimea ...

53
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:54,524
They take p? s and take the sand
to make? water out.

54
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:57,705
After one hour,
the? water eat? yourself out.

55
00:08:58,406 --> 00:09:01,637
You? You know it worked when
she takes tourists ...

56
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,638
and creates a standing wave.

57
00:09:05,013 --> 00:09:07,311
The waves do not v? O nowhere,
but you ?, yes.

58
00:09:08,016 --> 00:09:12,316
Surf with or without, they d? O
a way to have fun.

59
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:23,820
The? Only problem there?
grab a Lepto-know-l? o-qu ?.

60
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:27,167
No one knows what? that,
but do not worry.

61
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:29,666
When your nails ca? Rem
you? You know who took it.

62
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:37,337
The best standing wave in the world
is at the heart ... ??

63
00:09:37,712 --> 00:09:39,339

pumping? water against a wall.

66
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:53,425
If nature do not do the wave,
surfers do it.

67
00:09:53,561 --> 00:09:57,190
The guy at the controls decides
who stays and who goes.

68
00:09:58,232 --> 00:10:00,200
'' Get out of here, young lady. ''

00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,539
Kelly Slater in True

This? the inventor

71
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:13,047
I think doing some tests.

00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:18,382
The operator decides:

You know, we

They spent the night planning.
There were so many places to go.

It would be more pr? Tico go to places
where j? They knew people.

120
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:30,104
So it would be cheaper.

by modern short boards.

125
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:50,056
Wingnut seems to live
in another era.

126
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:54,564
He knows more of the old days
I surf, and I was there ?.

127
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:58,071
He never told where
He got the nickname '' Wingnut ''.

128
00:13:58,773 --> 00:14:01,003
It must be something pretty bad.

129
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,509
Al? M traditional maneuvers
how to go at the end of the board ...

130

it also? m doing things
with which we never dreamed.

131
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:19,185
One thing ? right:
Wingnut loves surfing.

132
00:14:23,564 --> 00:14:26,533

more surfing that Wingnut ...

He participates in competition for ?? es
be able to pay the rent and travel.

138
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:48,548
Mention a regular job
and he is white.

139
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,559
Think of these waves
Breaking Without him ...

140
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,555
? something very dif? cil
for him to bear.

141

What Pat and Wingnut t? M
in common? They love surfing.

142
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:03,833
To travel the world
you? You need money.

143
00:15:04,205 --> 00:15:08,164
Pat had 7000 d? Households
He won a competition ?? the surf.

144
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:09,839
Wingnut told Pat ...

145
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:13,510
he had hidden money
in vain rivers banks in the world.

146
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:19,012
But I guess that do not.

147
00:15:20,054 --> 00:15:22,022
You? You have to say goodbye
of loved ones.

148
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:25,192
'' Honey, I travel the world

They may do not stay
t? o thrilled as you ?.

150
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:40,036
For a surfer, packing
It can take a long time ...

151
00:15:40,408 --> 00:15:42,035
about 5 minutes.

152
00:15:42,743 --> 00:15:45,371
Pat takes only 30 seconds.

153
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,708
He plays everything inside

00:18:41,222 --> 00:18:45,181
The Costa Rica? a beautiful pa? s with

191
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:48,858
back Pac? am
and the Caribbean.

192
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:53,196
This? one of the
local woodcutters.

193
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:59,129
Forests s? The hardwood.

194
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:02,704
In passing, you? note
the stakes of the fence ...

195
00:19:02,843 --> 00:19:07,473
est? eats? walk to sprout,
returning to be? trees growing.

196
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:10,980
? so it looks like a stake
about 200 years.

197
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:21,222
Let's course? Pac coast? I get,

named Witch's Rock.

199
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:28,900
To get ? beach you?
need to go through this stud? river ...

200
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:31,334
where Cain? He Lives.

201

but do not t? great,
only 3 or 4 m.

203
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:42,671
They do not saw Cain? O some,
but this was in the head? to them.

204
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:46,683
They '' rowed '' using
only the fingertips.

205
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:52,257
They arrived safely at the beach,
but the sand est? too hot.

206
00:19:52,393 --> 00:19:55,021
LSSO causes have
to run at? the beach.

207
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:03,259
There were beautiful waves
at Witch's Rock ...

208
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:06,373
only four
and more no one around.

209
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:11,374
Robert August, after 48 years, it seems
the same surfer 1 8 years.

210
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:25,956
The wave of the day
He was to Pat.

211
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:29,392
He was sunburnt,
so it was in the shade.

212
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:44,744
A boat appeared on the breaks ??.

213
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:49,310
He belonged to one of the cousins
the sister? Mark.

214
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,975
They carried
a load at? the coast.

215
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:56,419
Surfers asked for a ride
at? a place called Ollie's Point.

216
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:07,693
They'll take us?

217
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:12,038
Climb aboard, friend.
How are you?

218
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,367
Very good.

219
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:16,266
Good to see you.

220
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:19,379
The? Single means of arriving
to Ollie's Point? of boat.

221
00:21:19,747 --> 00:21:23,274
When they arrived l ?,
the wind blew the earth ...

222
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:28,377
very good for surfing, if you?
able to take his board.

223
00:21:32,426 --> 00:21:35,725
The sea was too.
Another beautiful place ...

224
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:38,724
? Optimal waves
and no one around.

225
00:21:52,446 --> 00:21:54,744
Marco has a workshop
boards in San Jos? ...

226
00:21:55,115 --> 00:21:57,413
which is 5 times of the ocean.

227
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:00,348
Why be? what
the neg? ness do not see so well?

228
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:03,356
Pat razed.

229
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:19,699
Wingnut? good at improvisation.
It turns something that happens ...

230
00:22:20,574 --> 00:22:23,543
into something that looks
he had the intention to do ??.

231
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:29,944
The inhabitants named Ollie's Point
because of Oliver North.

232
00:22:30,084 --> 00:22:33,383
Supposedly, the CIA had
a secret base in the valley ...

233
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:37,383
which provided weapons
the rebels in NICAR? water.

234
00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:40,955
It was a big secret. That is why,
they call him Ollie's Point.

235
00:22:41,095 --> 00:22:43,723
Everyone knew it,
except Congress.

236
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:49,293
This? type of day
with which surfers dream:

237
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:52,064
just you? and your friends,
good wind ...

238
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:56,068

quality waves ...

239
00:22:56,276 --> 00:23:00,508
and parqu? more pr meter? ximo
far away.

240
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:19,088
They had to walk
back to Witch's Rock.

241
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:21,861
No one saw if the s? footprint
in any way.

242
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:31,533
They went down a river
and went through? s jungle.

243
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:37,209
The jungles est? The
full of monkeys.

244
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:40,212
They seem le? S moaning.

245
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:45,551
Look at this stuff!

246
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:50,563
You? also? m gemeria
if their eggs were frozen.

247
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:58,136
H? many girls
and beautiful in Costa Rica.

248
00:23:58,272 --> 00:24:01,173
Pat fell in love,
often.

249
00:24:02,376 --> 00:24:06,335
Robert said that they liked
older men, as it ...

250
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:10,012
rather little boys
as Pat and Wingnut.

251
00:24:10,384 --> 00:24:12,682
The Spanish I do not perfect it was.

252
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:25,926
On weekends,
Costa Rica? a party.

253
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:31,368
They dance am of Friday? at night?
second, when v? the work.

254
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:46,614
Most towns have
v? holiday '' fiestas '' during the year.

255
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:49,051
Each
It has a local band.

256
00:24:50,924 --> 00:24:53,449
Everyone appears,
even those who live far away.

257
00:24:53,594 --> 00:24:55,789
They spend the s? Bados
parading for the? ...

258
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:59,831
m playing? sic drinking Guaro,
a local drink ...

259
00:25:00,033 --> 00:25:03,662
made of cane a car ??
and nitroglycerin.

260
00:25:05,873 --> 00:25:08,501
The main event of '' fiesta ''
this city takes place on Sunday ...

261
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:12,073
when they pick up some bulls
and let them brave enough ...

262
00:25:12,212 --> 00:25:15,181
or who j? He drank a lot Guaro,
try mont? them.

263
00:25:15,883 --> 00:25:21,753
They were going to try, but when the bull
He came close, seemed too big.

264
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:25,848
They took a look
and sa? l Ram? like a rocket.

265
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:29,028
I scraped knees,
I never felt so afraid.

266
00:25:29,396 --> 00:25:33,696
Drinks v? M in pl bags? Sticos
so do not throw bottles are in the arena.

267
00:25:35,402 --> 00:25:38,701
This guy was my her? I.
He drank so much Guaro ...

268
00:25:38,906 --> 00:25:44,367
I could barely stand ?, p
but knew how to ride!

269
00:25:51,084 --> 00:25:53,052
They met a boy
on-site restaurant ...

270
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,719
who said he would take the
to surf on your avi? o.

271
00:25:56,924 --> 00:26:02,157
He had a hidroavi? The second. War
and knew some nice places.

272
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:06,158
They thought it was
face conversation, but do not age.

273
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:18,011
The v? O was
a little strange.

274
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:35,592
V? The cool,
let's surf.

275

-Let's go?!
-Thank you.

276
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:41,697
Thank you.
It was a v? Radical.

277
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:44,367
-No problem.
I know, man.

278
00:26:51,578 --> 00:26:54,775
A place called Playa Negra:
sunny, good wind ...

279
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:57,213
and perfect condition ?? es.

280
00:26:57,584 --> 00:27:00,815
The temperature of? Water
It was about 31 degrees.

281
00:27:01,188 --> 00:27:04,487
They surfed
in colder places ...

282
00:27:05,192 --> 00:27:08,491
and other
with? warmer water.

283
00:27:14,368 --> 00:27:17,895
Robert plans to live in a
property, nearby ...

284
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:23,340
forever, or at? die,
whichever comes first.

285
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,927
Things to do Wingnut
They never cease to amaze me.

286
00:27:43,063 --> 00:27:44,928
Here, after the fall ...

287
00:27:45,065 --> 00:27:49,024
he was at? the board
who was fit? down ...

288
00:27:49,403 --> 00:27:52,702
He stood on it,
and continued surfing.

289
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,878
Pat and Wingnut always discuss
on the type board.

290
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:06,315
Pat took a chance? longboard.

291
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,659
He said:
'' No'm cool? ''

292
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:17,227
A week away from California? CALIFORNIA ...

293
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:20,663
and j? live your dream
a see? endless.

294
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:28,565
Pat? the more enthusiastic surfer
of all time.

295
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:33,339
No matter the condition ?? sea,
est? always a good.

296
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:35,682
I think we do not have a day
? No he says:

297
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:39,348
'' That was the best wave
that j? I took in life! ''

298
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,245
Every day he says the same thing.

299
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,914
This particular day
he decided without d? life at ...

300
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:48,027
that this was the best wave
he j? He had taken in life.

301
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:52,198
He do not was joking,
really felt it.

302
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:14,813
When you est? excited, walks
at the beach for an hour or two.

303
00:29:19,025 --> 00:29:22,984
While Pat and Wingnut t? M the beaches
Costa Rica s? for them...

304
00:29:23,363 --> 00:29:26,992
let's see what is? happening,
while in Hawaii ?.

305
00:29:28,702 --> 00:29:33,332
North Shore of Oahu, the coast
the most famous surf the world.

306
00:29:34,374 --> 00:29:37,673
Of Velvyland where surfed
the first time in 1958 ...

307
00:29:38,044 --> 00:29:40,672
and was named after
boards builder Dave Velvy ...

308
00:29:41,715 --> 00:29:47,347
at? Sunset Beach, Rocky Point,
Pipeline, Waimea Bay and Haliewa ...

309
00:29:47,721 --> 00:29:51,020
the most famous in the world
for its big waves.

310
00:30:02,068 --> 00:30:05,936
This? a wave of size m? dio,
around 5 m.

311
00:30:06,072 --> 00:30:10,031
Yet large enough to
scare any normal person.

312
00:30:18,752 --> 00:30:22,051
The lower,
more crowded it gets.

313
00:30:28,762 --> 00:30:34,291
A 3 m? rid? culo. The guy
at the top a card sends to the m and?:

314
00:30:34,434 --> 00:30:37,062
'?, Surfed Waimea today.' '

315
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:43,068
If you think you're here? sold out
d? a look on the road.

316
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,408
The beaches also? M do not were deserted.

317
00:30:47,781 --> 00:30:51,410
More photographic lenses? Stay
that in a lan? ning space.

318
00:30:56,456 --> 00:31:00,017
Before you? It could be arrested
By using these swimsuits.

319
00:31:00,727 --> 00:31:03,025
This to? still can.

320
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:09,365
The breaks ?? the most spectacular
there? the tube.

321
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,937
The most impressive wave
of the world.

322
00:31:13,073 --> 00:31:14,700
? t? the hollow and breaks
so is? the ...

323
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:19,034
displacing as much air and? water
You could kill you.

324
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:28,717
? better check
where est? going.

325
00:31:29,422 --> 00:31:32,050
You can get out of? Water
without a p ?.

326
00:31:45,105 --> 00:31:49,405
Some local surfers made
career these tubes.

327
00:31:49,776 --> 00:31:51,403
I call them elite.

328
00:31:51,778 --> 00:31:54,975
Guys like Johnny Boy Gomez,
Michael and Derek Ho ...

329
00:31:55,115 --> 00:31:59,347
Liam McNamara, Sunny Garcia,
Larry Rivers, Gerry Lopez ...

330
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:02,347
s? the experts.

331
00:32:03,223 --> 00:32:07,523
If you think you can come along
and putting bank ...

332
00:32:07,727 --> 00:32:11,026
will be
one experi? NCIA and both.

333
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:34,550
The right tube
? Call back door.

334
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:39,881
Stay long at the crest
Wave can cause disorders.

335
00:32:43,596 --> 00:32:47,225
Delve deep into the tube
and leave again? an art.

336
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:00,511
Even after so many waves
Ghost? sticas who took ...

337
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,509
when they get a good,
yet they are happy.

338
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:28,939
The tube ? a very dangerous place.
The wave ? dangerous enough ...

339
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:34,707
but d? a look at the background.
Shallow and stones.

340
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:44,045
All sorts of things to beat
and holes to get stuck.

341
00:33:47,093 --> 00:33:52,725
The holes, you? finds chunk the
board, teeth, whatever.

342
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:03,899
The ?? curls the West pushes
sand into the channel ...

343
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:06,342
ending with
more depth.

344
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:10,505
Ent? O you? want out
the wave in time. Skirt!

345
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:17,349
If you do not leave,
You will end up eating sand.

346
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:34,598
What to do now?
No is the? Water to soak.

347
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:37,710
For get to?
and face the animal.

348
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:46,052
Doing this leads to a commonplace.

349
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:49,388
Hundreds boards
They break in North Shore.

350
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:59,657
Back in Honolulu,
defeated.

351
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:03,161
The child? Hawaiian
They grow on the beach.

352
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:08,496
'' Ah! Paraffin mixed with sand
and p? you dog. Not bad.''

353
00:35:11,211 --> 00:35:16,171
They j? face waves
before they even get floor.

354
00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:20,849
So it? S the good surfers.
They almost live in? Water.

355
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:24,853
A small mistake here
and took a tumble.

356
00:35:27,227 --> 00:35:29,855
The sibling found it hil? Rio.

357
00:35:31,231 --> 00:35:35,759
When you? j? ? an old man,
Barron as T.J., which is 5 years ...

358
00:35:35,902 --> 00:35:40,100
need to eat? air to walk a plank.
His father modeling boards.

359
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,870
TJ still do not handle wave alone,
then? the father d? one push? o.

360
00:35:45,245 --> 00:35:47,543
Once l? inside, it destroys.

361
00:35:56,923 --> 00:35:59,824
TJ makes
the kids cringe.

362
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:05,828
For T.J., each wave
It has twice the size.

363
00:36:11,871 --> 00:36:16,501
Five years,
1, 0 m 1 and 20 kg.

364
00:36:16,709 --> 00:36:20,338
He can break when
is much older, to six years.

365
00:36:21,748 --> 00:36:23,716
Let's see what Pat
and Wingnut est? the plotting.

366
00:36:23,883 --> 00:36:27,751
They crossed
Ocean Atl? ntico ...

367
00:36:27,887 --> 00:36:30,515
towards pr ximo destination?
Fran a.

368
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,189
SOMEWHERE OF FRAN? The ...

369
00:36:39,232 --> 00:36:44,534
The cheapest car carrying
the board was a Deux Chevaux 67.

370
00:36:44,904 --> 00:36:48,863
The first problem was
find sa? of Paris.

371
00:36:55,248 --> 00:36:57,876
Finally they made it out
Paris and get on the highway ...

372
00:36:58,251 --> 00:37:01,379
found that where the car
do not was compat? level with the road.

373
00:37:01,521 --> 00:37:04,490
It s? It reached 40 km / h.

374
00:37:04,857 --> 00:37:06,825
They were going to find
Tommy Curren ...

375
00:37:07,193 --> 00:37:11,061
a famous surfer from California? CALIFORNIA
who lived v? rivers years ...

376
00:37:11,197 --> 00:37:17,500
in Biarritz, that s? then? o
They saw that was 640 km away.

377
00:37:24,377 --> 00:37:25,674
To do not be bowled over
on the highway ...

378
00:37:26,045 --> 00:37:30,004
they took roads
neighborhood, and soon lost.

379
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:34,349
They used towels
to shelter from the rain.

380
00:37:40,727 --> 00:37:44,356
If you? est you think? lost
on the road, wait at? stop to eat.

381
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:46,699
They do not speak
a word of franc? s.

382
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:50,532
'' Point to somewhere
the card? pious and pray. ''

383
00:37:50,737 --> 00:37:53,934
I thought I
?? translates the pro ingl? s.

384
00:37:54,073 --> 00:37:58,032
-You Know some of these things?
N? I have id? Would.

385
00:37:58,411 --> 00:37:59,969
Pretend? franc's.

386
00:38:03,683 --> 00:38:06,311
-What ? that?
- 'Le r ti de porc?' '.

387
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,988
-What ??
- '' Des escargots. ''

388
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,988
I asked slugs!
Believe that?

389
00:38:17,697 --> 00:38:19,665
I asked slugs.

390
00:38:21,034 --> 00:38:25,334
I will release the animals, man.
No I can eat it.

391
00:38:27,206 --> 00:38:29,401
It rained for two days ...

392
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:32,511
but they managed to go
the 640 km at? Biarritz ...

393
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:37,839
and locate the home of Tommy.
Like two wet chicks ...

394
00:38:38,718 --> 00:38:41,016
when the storm
It got worse.

395
00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:42,684
They've managed to s.

396
00:38:43,056 --> 00:38:45,024
D? to surf?

397
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:47,253
? Optimal condition ?? es.

398
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:51,352
You can go take a look
when my friend arrived.

399
00:38:52,398 --> 00:38:56,357
They were at? one of the beaches
places to check.

400
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,300
The rain of hundred years.

401
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,479
Tommy do not say, but you?
You know what I was thinking.

402
00:39:08,181 --> 00:39:10,809
'' You? S should
be here yesterday. ''

403
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:17,152
In the? Last day in Biarritz,
Finally the storm passed.

404
00:39:21,194 --> 00:39:22,161
Surf? very popular ...

405
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:25,725
much more than?
in the United States.

406
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:29,494
They do some of their
pr Pippen boards: Superfrog.

407
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:34,165
It seems to California? CALIFORNIA.
Surf shops everywhere.

408
00:39:40,713 --> 00:39:45,343
One of the beaches, saw
the inhabitants wear little clothing.

409
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:48,179
It takes a little
to get used to.

410
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:54,587
I think she liked me.

411
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:56,354
What do you? you think?

412
00:39:57,397 --> 00:40:01,265
I think if you? living here
and get the hang of it ...

413
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:07,704
d? to spend. There is a way
to get used to it?

414
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:13,710
You? passes once and do not return.
Never come back to take another look.

415
00:40:20,253 --> 00:40:23,882
Tommy? one of the most influential
surfers? d last? each.

416
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:26,885
Tr? S times champion? The world
in professional circuits ...

417
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,559
but still ? The most
Surfers call 'soul surfer' '.

418
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,794
Tommy? man of few words.

419
00:40:35,935 --> 00:40:38,563
He lets his surfing,
and your hand sic ...

420
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:42,237
we are hearing now,
speak for themselves.

421
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:53,085
He? m? logical within d '? gua.

422
00:41:01,727 --> 00:41:06,357
Whenever Pat and looked Wingnut
to the beach, they saw breasts.

423
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:09,527
LSSO shifted the focus ?? the.

424
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,378
It got bad later
but it's alright.

425
00:41:23,749 --> 00:41:27,708
Everyone jumped on longboards
and they were having fun.

426
00:41:45,104 --> 00:41:48,073
Some surfers get bored
if the sea do not est? good.

427
00:41:48,608 --> 00:41:52,908
They do not. They always
est? the order of what is? rolling.

428
00:42:00,553 --> 00:42:04,853
Shortboard, longboard, body surf.
Tommy? good at all.

429
00:42:11,564 --> 00:42:16,866
Pat tried to learn to play
viol? e Tommy tried to help.

430
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,197
How to do it?
It was very nice.

431
00:42:20,573 --> 00:42:24,532
We're in the middle of the can ??.
'Sorry, I was enjoying it.

432
00:42:26,913 --> 00:42:28,540
Let's eat? O.

433
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:34,379
Snoopy, the dog Tommy,
Pat thought he played well ...

434
00:42:35,087 --> 00:42:37,715
and wanted to return to Paris
with him.

435
00:42:40,259 --> 00:42:44,559
He got mad when Tommy
tried tir? I do the car.

436
00:42:52,438 --> 00:42:54,406
Snooppy? one groupie,

437
00:42:54,774 --> 00:42:57,402
He really liked the m? Sica Pat.

438

Bye-bye, child? The.
We will miss you ..

439
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,419

The world famous landmark
Cape Town? Table Mountain.

442
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:34,106
H? a cable car that leads to the top.

443
00:43:34,246 --> 00:43:37,875
They joined the other
tourists for the ride.

444
00:43:41,587 --> 00:43:43,885
From the top, you? looks
to the pen? nsula ...

445
00:43:44,256 --> 00:43:48,124
the end of Africa.

446
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,560
The Atl? Ntico is on one side
and the Ocean? ndico on the other.

447
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:00,671
The landscapes around
Cape Town s? the spectacular.

448
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:09,011
They arranged a meeting with her father
South African surfing, John Whitmore.

449
00:44:09,715 --> 00:44:14,675
He? the same guy who showed
the pa? s Mike and Robert in 1964.

450
00:44:15,054 --> 00:44:18,023
This? John surfing in? Poca.

451
00:44:21,227 --> 00:44:26,096
A lot has changed. The city grew,
what do not let John very happy.

452
00:44:26,232 --> 00:44:29,861
Look at all these homes.
Before I do not was nothing.

453
00:44:30,403 --> 00:44:33,702
He likes to grumble,
but it has a ?? blush gold.

454
00:44:36,075 --> 00:44:38,942
John took them a surf saf? Ri
on the West Coast ...

455
00:44:39,078 --> 00:44:43,037
the same thing he had done
by surfers for d? decades.

456
00:44:43,749 --> 00:44:45,614
John now est? retired.

457
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:48,276
He built boards
for over 35 years ...

458
00:44:48,421 --> 00:44:53,381
and spent relat? surf rivers by r? dio
your bathroom overlooking the sea.

459
00:44:54,093 --> 00:44:57,722
They went to a place
in Atl? ntico called Elandsbaai.

460
00:44:59,865 --> 00:45:04,495
They were lucky. The day
It was good, which was rare.

461
00:45:05,538 --> 00:45:08,166
Wingnut was in for? So surfer.

462
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:11,843
You? never go hungry here.
In March low ...

463
00:45:12,211 --> 00:45:15,180
you? manages to catch
lobsters in po? the.

464
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:23,184
Pat? vegetarian.
With its energy ...

465
00:45:23,556 --> 00:45:28,858
imagine how it would be if he
eat meat. It would InControl? Vel.

466
00:45:33,566 --> 00:45:37,195
Wingnut? degree in Economics
from the University of Santa Cruz.

467
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:41,870
Maybe I wanted to learn the economy
surfing more and work less.

468
00:45:52,418 --> 00:45:55,945
The cold Bengal current
comes from Ant? rtica ...

469
00:45:56,088 --> 00:45:58,283
and? water? cold,
in winter or see? o.

470
00:45:58,424 --> 00:46:01,325
Never exceeds 20 degrees.

471
00:46:06,031 --> 00:46:08,898
Wingnut do not believe.
I kept yelling:

472
00:46:09,034 --> 00:46:13,334
'' We are in? Africa. It's in the ?
the best wave of your life? ''

473
00:46:13,873 --> 00:46:16,842
Pat said: '' It was at?
one longboarder end it. ''

474
00:46:25,718 --> 00:46:28,687
John came up with his boogie board
to catch some waves.

475
00:46:29,054 --> 00:46:31,682
He stopped surfing
about 1 0 years atr? s ...

476
00:46:32,057 --> 00:46:35,026
because the waves were
too full to your liking.

477
00:46:36,395 --> 00:46:39,364
With a boogie board it can
surfing the algae ...

478
00:46:39,732 --> 00:46:42,701
where boards with
keels do not can go.

479
00:46:43,402 --> 00:46:48,362
After 65 years, it takes a good wave,
still lets out a scream.

480
00:46:51,076 --> 00:46:53,704
It was a day of surfing
fun in Elandsbaai.

481
00:46:55,748 --> 00:46:58,046
'' Hey, man, playing here. ''

482
00:46:58,751 --> 00:47:02,312
In the? South Africa,
the child? always come.

483
00:47:02,688 --> 00:47:05,316
And est? Always happy.

484
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,884
A unique restaurant
It is on the coast of Elands.

485
00:47:10,029 --> 00:47:12,998
If you? I do not know him,
direct pass through it.

486
00:47:13,532 --> 00:47:17,161
If you want to eat,
call the phone number 1 7.

487
00:47:18,037 --> 00:47:20,005
They'll cook for you m ?.

488
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,668
Everything? done
in fires.

489
00:47:24,043 --> 00:47:26,238

Outside ovens ...

and seafood ...

491
00:47:30,049 --> 00:47:33,018
with the trim ??
that you? imaginable.

492
00:47:33,552 --> 00:47:35,850
LSSO that place
? lim? and the butter.

493
00:47:38,557 --> 00:47:41,185
They put together a feast
that you? You do not believe me.

494
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:45,189
It costs 30 rand, about
1 0 d? American homes.

495
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,095
When you? think
that j? ate too much ...

496
00:47:50,236 --> 00:47:55,196
they bring the dessert: all
the lobster as you can eat.

497
00:47:59,845 --> 00:48:01,472
To enhance the charm ...

498
00:48:01,847 --> 00:48:04,816
H? one? great place
to surf right in front.

499
00:48:06,518 --> 00:48:11,148
The favorite place of John
? west coast? South Africa ...

500
00:48:11,523 --> 00:48:14,390
the least populated place
populated the planet.

501
00:48:14,526 --> 00:48:17,393
Thousands of quil? Meters
of deserted beaches.

502
00:48:17,529 --> 00:48:21,488
Windswept, cloudy,
with? cold water, many algae.

503
00:48:22,201 --> 00:48:25,830
Throughout Skeleton Coast
We find right handed? the ships.

504
00:48:26,538 --> 00:48:30,838
In some places you? You can drive
by v? quil rivers? meters the beach.

505
00:48:31,877 --> 00:48:35,176
The further north,
drier it becomes.

506
00:48:35,881 --> 00:48:39,510
John has a friend who lives l ?,
where it rained 1, 2 cm ...

507
00:48:39,885 --> 00:48:41,853
1 to 4 years old.

508
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:48,349
The vegetation ?? finally
d? place? s endless dunes.

509
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,767
This place? the face
John Whitmore.

510
00:48:57,903 --> 00:49:01,805
Who knows how many? Sweetbreads places
to surf on this coast can be ...

511
00:49:02,174 --> 00:49:04,142
on time.

512
00:49:07,012 --> 00:49:09,981
They ended up in a place
John calls '' No. 27 '' ...

513
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:15,377
because there? 27 other places
pr? ximos similar to this.

514
00:49:15,521 --> 00:49:18,490
? scary out here
for the first time.

515
00:49:18,857 --> 00:49:22,816
No one around,? Cold water,
not a clue what h? in deep...

516
00:49:23,195 --> 00:49:26,494
and? greater good
than it looked from the beach.

517
00:49:39,712 --> 00:49:42,681
This place is in the middle
to the? s the shark? white.

518
00:49:42,881 --> 00:49:44,508
No it? for nothing
John have stayed on the beach.

519
00:49:44,883 --> 00:49:48,512
In his boogie board, he
I feel like shark bait? o.

520
00:50:09,575 --> 00:50:13,204
Even after accustomed,
still scary.

521
00:50:14,246 --> 00:50:16,874
The salinity of? Water
and the waves crashing ...

522
00:50:17,249 --> 00:50:20,218
They formed a strange foam.

523
00:50:36,769 --> 00:50:41,729
John called this place of No mere 27.
Them, '' Recife Strange ''.

524
00:50:42,441 --> 00:50:44,966
They had a beautiful
adventure on the West Coast ...

525
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:47,305
but it was time to return
? Cape Town...

526
00:50:47,446 --> 00:50:50,074
and go due to pr?'d put
to the East Coast ...

527
00:50:50,449 --> 00:50:54,078
along the ocean? ndico.
John had a car for them.

528
00:50:54,453 --> 00:50:58,412
-H? years he do not walk.
- The perfect ve Tour century.

529
00:51:01,727 --> 00:51:03,592
Well, do not?
Where you found this thing?

530
00:51:03,729 --> 00:51:06,027
No I found him. He grew up.

531
00:51:06,398 --> 00:51:08,366
Far? Is adjustable? Ble ...

533
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:15,707
The gas tank
I was rusty ...

534
00:51:16,075 --> 00:51:18,703
then? John placed
other in back ...

535
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:21,209
He called the carburetor ...

536
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,548
He improvised a league ?? the ...

537
00:51:23,916 --> 00:51:25,543
and wished good luck to them.

538
00:51:25,751 --> 00:51:27,719
The right side? Suicide hatred.

539
00:51:32,758 --> 00:51:37,058
'Here we drive on the left side,
ent? o, ?? the attention. ''

540
00:51:43,602 --> 00:51:46,571
It takes a little getting used to.

541
00:51:56,782 --> 00:52:00,240
Ready for another adventure,
heading for Cape St. Francis ...

542
00:52:00,385 --> 00:52:03,354
800 km above
on the coast of? ndico ...

543
00:52:03,555 --> 00:52:07,514
retracing the steps of Mike
and Robert 30 years before.

544
00:52:10,729 --> 00:52:13,357
When you? d? face

has id? ia that can
be in the vicinity a.

546
00:52:24,743 --> 00:52:28,941
Sitting in a buggy, looking
for the true African elephant ...

547
00:52:29,081 --> 00:52:31,049
? something pretty impressive.

548
00:52:31,416 --> 00:52:34,715
The elephant ? the animal
the most dangerous? Africa.

549
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,718
Pat and Wingnut do not know that.

550
00:52:44,096 --> 00:52:46,064
They can run
65 km / h ...

551
00:52:46,265 --> 00:52:49,564
and go from zero to 65
in 3.2 seconds ...

00:52:49,768 --> 00:52:53,397
1 0 second most r? Pido
the buggy.

553
00:52:54,773 --> 00:52:59,073
When stretching the ears,
? because est? the brave.

554
00:52:59,378 --> 00:53:02,575
No matter how many National
Geographics you? I have seen.

555
00:53:02,714 --> 00:53:06,343
See a close animal
in his pr? prio habitat ...

556
00:53:06,718 --> 00:53:10,347
? one experi? NCIA that
you? never power? forget.

557
00:53:44,256 --> 00:53:47,453
The animal with the highest fingernails
in the legs? the ostrich.

558
00:53:47,593 --> 00:53:51,552
They swallow anything
Pat O'Connell size.

559
00:54:04,042 --> 00:54:08,342
H? large farms of ostriches
by l ?, as cattle farms.

560
00:54:09,381 --> 00:54:12,578
They did training
to tame ostriches ...

561
00:54:12,718 --> 00:54:15,016
but they do not got jobs.

562
00:54:19,224 --> 00:54:22,523
They explored the coast
Ocean? ndico ...

563
00:54:22,728 --> 00:54:24,696
on the way
to the Cape St. Francis ...

564
00:54:24,896 --> 00:54:27,865
where we surfed
30 years earlier.

565
00:54:29,234 --> 00:54:32,431
The dream of Wingnut
It was crossing the dunes ...

566
00:54:32,571 --> 00:54:35,199
to give first glance
at sea.

567
00:54:45,751 --> 00:54:48,276
Pat said:
'' Wingnut this? idiocy.

568
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:51,389
Now has the road to l ?. ''
Wingnut said ...

569
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:54,889
'' I know, but always
I wanted to do it. ''

570
00:54:56,094 --> 00:54:58,392
It took nearly 30 years
since the day that ...

571
00:54:58,597 --> 00:55:02,499
Robert August, Mike Hensen, Terence
the? Africa and a guy named James ...

572
00:55:03,201 --> 00:55:07,160
They crossed the dunes
look to the sea.

573
00:55:07,873 --> 00:55:11,172
No it was nothing l ?,
just perfect waves.

574
00:55:16,882 --> 00:55:18,747
Now, tr? S d? Ed after ...

575
00:55:18,884 --> 00:55:21,853
Pat and crossed Wingnut
the same dunes ...

576
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:24,518
to give the first look.

577
00:55:36,568 --> 00:55:40,527
A place with 1, 000 homes
luxurious and condom? domains.

578
00:55:45,577 --> 00:55:48,205
The sea was still there ?,
and they were surfing.

579
00:55:54,586 --> 00:55:56,451
No it was t? The perfect
As soon...

580
00:55:56,588 --> 00:56:00,046
because vegetation planted the ??
the dunes for stabilizers? -Las ...

581
00:56:00,192 --> 00:56:02,490
and maintaining the sand
outside the houses.

582
00:56:02,694 --> 00:56:05,891
The sand used to enter the sea
and fill the rocky bottom ...

583
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:10,661
which was smooth,
leaving the perfect waves.

584
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:13,565
No sand
to fill the rocky bottom ...

585
00:56:13,705 --> 00:56:17,664
the sea est? more irregular
and break into pieces.

586
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:21,672
Furthermore ? a beautiful wave,
but do not? the same thing.

587
00:56:26,385 --> 00:56:28,683
We were the first
to surf here in the '60s ...

588
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:32,251
and when we asked for fishermen
how long so broke ...

589
00:56:32,391 --> 00:56:36,589
they said, '' All the time. ''
It was s? what they said.

590
00:56:36,728 --> 00:56:41,688
S? we found
that do not was always so.

591
00:56:44,236 --> 00:56:47,865
Wingnut was thrilled
by surfing the wave dreamed ...

592
00:56:48,073 --> 00:56:50,041
H? so many years.

593
00:57:12,197 --> 00:57:14,062
Pr? Ximo to Cape St. Francis ...

594
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:16,827
They crossed with a truck? o
I thought it was broken ...

595
00:57:17,202 --> 00:57:19,500
and stopped to help.

596
00:57:20,539 --> 00:57:22,837
Pleasure.

597
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:25,570
-What Est? doing?
-Ajustando The sights of the rifle.

598
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:27,234
Can I shoot?
-Of course.

599
00:57:27,379 --> 00:57:29,677
What a great shot.

600
00:57:31,383 --> 00:57:33,010
It looks like a torpedo.

601
00:57:33,885 --> 00:57:35,853
I never shot before.

602
00:57:36,054 --> 00:57:39,353
Hold tight.
D? a beautiful kick.

603
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:48,596
Oh my God!

604
00:57:48,733 --> 00:57:51,361
No we can us? It does at?
I clean the drum.

605
00:57:53,238 --> 00:57:56,207
He was a little upset
by Pat dropping the gun.

606
00:57:56,575 --> 00:57:58,543
You? clean
and ready.

607
00:58:00,512 --> 00:58:05,711
A? Great place to surf in? Africa
South is called Jeffreysbaai ...

608
00:58:05,851 --> 00:58:08,149
do not far away
Cape Saint Francis.

609
00:58:09,187 --> 00:58:14,147
They were going to find the most famous
Surfer? Africa, Shaun Tomson.

610
00:58:14,526 --> 00:58:18,485
The first eyesight was memor? Vel,
one of the best days of the year ...

611
00:58:18,697 --> 00:58:22,656
and '' Mr. Jaybaai ''
Shaun Tomson, raged.

612
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:33,072
Shaun and Walter friend came
Durban, where they live ...

613
00:58:33,211 --> 00:58:35,179
to find Pat and Wingnut.

614
00:58:36,047 --> 00:58:37,344
This? Walter.

615
00:58:37,716 --> 00:58:39,911
Nice to meet you ?.
-Nice.

616
00:58:40,051 --> 00:58:41,678
Waves. Big waves.

617
00:58:45,223 --> 00:58:49,182
-vi Who got perfect waves.
-A? Last was impressive.

618
00:58:49,561 --> 00:58:51,859
Not bad,
to an old man.

619
00:58:52,063 --> 00:58:55,032
Come with us,
we will come again.

620
00:58:55,233 --> 00:58:58,532
That wave! Curls ?? the
picks up the? whole area ...

621
00:58:58,904 --> 00:59:02,135
the wave will going ...

622
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:08,035
It seems a great irony.

623
00:59:08,179 --> 00:59:11,148
We find the perfect wave
St. Francis ...

624
00:59:11,516 --> 00:59:15,475
t? pica of a longboard,
but nearby ...

625
00:59:15,854 --> 00:59:18,152
est? the location that would be considered
the perfect wave ...

626
00:59:18,356 --> 00:59:20,654
by default? s today.

627
00:59:26,197 --> 00:59:29,496
Pat with a good one.
No to think he was happy?

628
00:59:40,211 --> 00:59:43,180
Wingnut an surfed
which lasted more than a minute.

629
00:59:44,215 --> 00:59:46,080
They say that in one day
in Jaybaai ...

630
00:59:46,217 --> 00:59:49,186
you? You can catch a wave
for about 5 minutes.

631
01:00:22,587 --> 01:00:24,782
Back in Santa Cruz,
he say? your friends ...

632
01:00:24,923 --> 01:00:28,222
'?, Jaybaai ...
I, Shaun Tomson, you know ...

633
01:00:28,593 --> 01:00:30,220
I gave him some tips. ''

634
01:00:49,781 --> 01:00:55,083
Shaun takes surge worldwide
and Jaybaai yet? his favorite place.

635
01:00:55,286 --> 01:01:00,087
My favorite wave? to Jeffrey.
Doing this?, I love the wave.

636
01:01:00,225 --> 01:01:02,853
It provides many
varieties, much is? a.

637
01:01:03,395 --> 01:01:05,363
She? very r? rupted ...

638
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:08,597
but also? m d?
for strong moves ...

639
01:01:08,733 --> 01:01:11,258
and has
Ghost tubes? sticos ...

640
01:01:11,403 --> 01:01:14,031
what? the thing I like best.

641
01:01:35,593 --> 01:01:37,891
When you? think
that est? rocking in? gua ...

642
01:01:38,263 --> 01:01:41,892
some guys show
to humble you.

643
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,228
If you? swam thus
You do not need a board ...

644
01:01:45,603 --> 01:01:47,230
or strap ...

645
01:01:47,605 --> 01:01:50,574
or wetsuit ...
or a car.

646
01:01:55,613 --> 01:01:58,582
Among millions? Es of Zulus
the? South Africa ...

647
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:01,077
Walter? the only one surfing.

648
01:02:01,219 --> 01:02:04,086
It s? surfed near Durban,
where? shallow and sandy ...

649
01:02:04,222 --> 01:02:07,191
ent? o, losing the board,
? s? stay p ?.

650
01:02:10,228 --> 01:02:13,425
No s do not realize, but
he never learned to swim.

651
01:02:13,565 --> 01:02:16,864
A friend said:
'' If you need to swim, beat the bra? The ...

652
01:02:17,068 --> 01:02:20,037
and beat the p? s like a sapo.
THE? you? go swimming. ''

653
01:02:20,405 --> 01:02:23,374
PAPS do not could believe.
The guy surfing ...

654
01:02:23,575 --> 01:02:25,543
but do not know how to swim!

655
01:02:26,077 --> 01:02:29,046
-Voc? love the sea?
-I Love because ...

656
01:02:29,748 --> 01:02:33,377
the sea and the surf
make me happy.

657
01:02:33,752 --> 01:02:37,051
? Sometimes I'm going surfing
because of the problems.

658
01:02:37,255 --> 01:02:41,885
If I'm surfing, I do not think of them.
S? I'm waiting for the wave.

659
01:02:42,427 --> 01:02:45,396
I think he summed up very well
the feelings of surfers.

660
01:02:47,432 --> 01:02:51,391
They were with Shaun and Walter
for a few weeks ...

661
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:54,068
and they became friends.

662
01:02:55,774 --> 01:02:59,232
When it came time to leave,
They gave many things to Walter ...

663
01:02:59,377 --> 01:03:01,345
turning it into a genu? in ...

664
01:03:01,713 --> 01:03:03,340
surfer.

665
01:03:13,057 --> 01:03:15,355
There was a guy named J.P. ...

666
01:03:15,727 --> 01:03:18,696
John Whitmore
He asked that they seek.

667
01:03:19,063 --> 01:03:20,587
-Voc? should be J.P.
Okay.

668
01:03:20,732 --> 01:03:23,360
-I'm Pat, this? Wingnut.
-Nice.

669
01:03:24,068 --> 01:03:26,696
John said you? show
some animals for us.

670
01:03:27,071 --> 01:03:30,040
Can I take you? S,
or they can go alone.

671
01:03:30,241 --> 01:03:33,870
All right go driving?
-N' Leave the car.

672
01:03:34,078 --> 01:03:36,376
Maybe you? S find
some cats.

673
01:03:36,748 --> 01:03:40,275
? a little late, but it can be.
V? Like ride.

674
01:03:40,418 --> 01:03:43,046
-At? later.
-Certainly.

675
01:03:43,588 --> 01:03:46,887
No stop or the
have? the major problems.

676
01:03:57,435 --> 01:04:00,666
No it was a good time
for the buggy engui? air.

677
01:04:10,381 --> 01:04:12,349
No taste of use
the word '' death ''.

678
01:04:16,554 --> 01:04:20,183
The buggy booth? light,
of fiberglass.

679
01:04:21,059 --> 01:04:24,358
It seems they were
a can of food for cats.

680
01:04:32,403 --> 01:04:33,700
God.

681
01:04:40,411 --> 01:04:42,709
And I thought the guys
the bad beach.

682
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:49,379
They're the eating
my card? The Texaco.

683
01:04:50,755 --> 01:04:53,053
Bye-bye, wetsuit.

684
01:05:22,553 --> 01:05:27,513
Pat told Wingnut: '' I said
to do not let that meat in the bag! ''

685
01:05:31,562 --> 01:05:35,191
The le? S spent the rest
the day eating their luggage.

686
01:05:37,902 --> 01:05:41,861
Wingnut spent the rest of the time
Surfing well ventilated.

687
01:05:50,081 --> 01:05:51,946
They left the buggy
in Cape Town ...

688
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:54,278
They said goodbye to John Whitmore ...

689
01:05:54,419 --> 01:05:56,717
They traveled by
Ocean? Ndico ...

690
01:05:57,422 --> 01:05:59,219
the Australian continent ...

691
01:05:59,357 --> 01:06:01,655
and by
Pac? I get south ...

692
01:06:02,026 --> 01:06:03,994
to Fiji ...

693
01:06:04,696 --> 01:06:08,655
and an island in particular,
Tavarila.

694
01:06:11,369 --> 01:06:14,668
In Tavarila h? a resort
construction? s? for surfers ...

695
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:18,338
something I do not imagine
atr few years? s.

696
01:06:19,377 --> 01:06:21,902
It has some cabins
called 'barays' ...

697
01:06:22,046 --> 01:06:24,241
nothing fancy, but nice.

698
01:06:24,382 --> 01:06:29,684
? a beautiful island with two of the best
surf the world places.

699
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,188
They went down in Nandi,
the main island of Viti Levu ...

700
01:06:38,563 --> 01:06:42,192
They rose on a bier
to go to Tavarila.

701
01:06:50,241 --> 01:06:53,210
? even a beautiful place.

702
01:07:33,217 --> 01:07:35,845
Pat and Wingnut down
H? few hours of avi? the ...

703
01:07:36,554 --> 01:07:41,184
and j? They were in the waves before
the bust ?? the so-called '' Restaurants ''.

704
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,859
The wind came up.
They jumped in the waves ...

705
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:49,859
but they found that the morning?
improve and it would be too much.

706
01:07:52,236 --> 01:07:55,535
Truly, Fiji?
the land of see? endless.

707
01:07:55,907 --> 01:08:00,139
And Ar? Close to 30 degrees water
throughout the year.

708
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:04,307
They had Hope? To
a good sea, but of course ...

709
01:08:04,682 --> 01:08:06,650
I was flat as a board.

710
01:08:07,018 --> 01:08:09,316
Maybe with the tide High
the sea improve.

711
01:08:10,021 --> 01:08:11,648
No the better.

712
01:08:12,023 --> 01:08:15,322
Even without surf, Tavarila
was a place? thymus to be.

713
01:08:15,693 --> 01:08:19,322
You? You can cross the whole island
1 to 5 minutes.

714
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:22,727
While they were there ?,
They became friends two people ...

715
01:08:22,867 --> 01:08:25,495
called Eddie and Eulie.

716
01:08:26,871 --> 01:08:30,830
Eulie loves surfing, but for Eddie,
? something half per? odo.

717
01:08:31,209 --> 01:08:33,734
I try every day.
I should work.

718
01:08:33,878 --> 01:08:38,838
-But ?, No time for surfing.
-Surf Every day.

719
01:08:40,718 --> 01:08:43,346
When you? catch a wave,
you? I smile.

720
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:48,358
Surf? fun.

721
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:51,028
Fish do not?.

722
01:08:51,729 --> 01:08:54,027
? Sometimes the fishing? good.

723
01:08:54,398 --> 01:08:58,027
Enough tuna to
feed the whole population ?? the island.

724
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:03,299
Eddie and Eulie took both
to visit other islands.

725
01:09:04,175 --> 01:09:06,803
H? 300 islands
Fiji ...

726
01:09:07,011 --> 01:09:10,310
about 50 of them close
enough to go bier.

727
01:09:10,848 --> 01:09:13,373
A? different from each other.
Some have? Sweetbreads resorts ...

728
01:09:13,518 --> 01:09:17,477
some s? the native villages,
and other s? the uninhabited.

729
01:09:20,191 --> 01:09:23,490
The? Most beautiful water
that j? saw.

730
01:09:31,035 --> 01:09:34,004
This small island
? pure white sand.

731
01:09:34,372 --> 01:09:36,670
No Footprint? view.

732
01:09:38,376 --> 01:09:41,345
This stick? National Forest.

733
01:09:43,047 --> 01:09:46,915
Eddie, Descal? O, come by
sharp coral reefs razor.

734
01:09:47,051 --> 01:09:50,680
The soles of your feet? S
They seem radial tires.

735
01:09:51,055 --> 01:09:53,353
Did The Aliens
look cowards.

736
01:09:56,394 --> 01:09:59,261
Eulie was always ready
for a joke ...

737
01:09:59,397 --> 01:10:02,696
like trying to hit
Pat with a coconut.

738
01:10:08,906 --> 01:10:12,535
Pat said:
'' You? I could have killed me! ''

739
01:10:18,416 --> 01:10:21,283
They had come
to Tavarila ...

740
01:10:21,419 --> 01:10:25,719
because tr? s the best surfers
the world would be there.

741
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:29,719
Kelly Slater, Jeff Booth
and Tom Carroll.

742
01:10:30,094 --> 01:10:33,063

745
01:10:41,439 --> 01:10:44,067
Tavarila home to hundreds
of sea snakes ...

746
01:10:44,775 --> 01:10:49,405
leaving the sea to rest
or do what snakes do.

747

They s? The poisonous,
do not h? ant? dote.

748

If they bite you ?,

But they t? M small mouths

750

No need to worry.

Ent? O, t ?.

It? Dirty water
and has old sock taste.

756
01:11:40,431 --> 01:11:44,060
You? Palm hitting once,
swallows ...

757
01:11:45,102 --> 01:11:49,061
then claps tr? s times.
And ready.

758
01:11:49,607 --> 01:11:52,235
It causes teeth to become soft.

759
01:11:58,449 --> 01:12:03,011
The girlfriend Kelly do not ag? Entou,
and spoiled his CD player.

with all the kids dance walk.

762
01:12:20,404 --> 01:12:23,373
J? it was late at night
when Pat and Wingnut ...

presented the Dan? a
P? BIRD Rain Fiji.

764

So Kava, not all
They made it back to the barays.

765
01:12:35,586 --> 01:12:38,555
Whether luck,

766
01:12:38,923 --> 01:12:42,552
and teeth est? the soft,
the sea is good.

767
01:12:44,595 --> 01:12:47,462
Here? '' Cloud Break ''
near Tavarila ...

768
01:12:47,598 --> 01:12:49,896
in the middle of the ocean.

769
01:12:52,269 --> 01:12:55,238
It seemed the day
It would be beautiful.

770
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:11,180
D? to hear the waves crashing
on the reef.

771
01:13:11,389 --> 01:13:13,357
It looks like a thunder it.

772
01:13:13,724 --> 01:13:18,024
There? S, the name given to the place
means' thunder Reef? the ''.

773
01:13:20,898 --> 01:13:24,197
The waves were too.

774
01:13:44,922 --> 01:13:47,550
This? Jeff Booth,
Laguna Beach, California ...

775
01:13:47,925 --> 01:13:50,553
exploring the place.

776

Tom Carroll?

Campe? The world in 1993
at age 20.

781
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:29,525
It is the Fl? Rida, impresses
it handles big waves.

782
01:14:33,571 --> 01:14:36,870
Kelly est? doing almost
all the tricks you know.

783
01:14:49,253 --> 01:14:52,222
Pat took super waves,
at? your belt broke.

784
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:57,550
His board passed the reef
and was never seen again.

785
01:14:58,262 --> 01:15:00,492
Luckily, he had a
reserve.

786
01:15:02,366 --> 01:15:05,665
No one believed as
Wingnut longboard surfing the ...

787
01:15:06,036 --> 01:15:08,334
particularly Tom Carroll.

788
01:15:08,706 --> 01:15:11,573
Wingnut deserves
a medal.

789
01:15:11,709 --> 01:15:17,341
He do not had any difficulty
to control the board.

790
01:15:17,548 --> 01:15:19,516
He stood firm.

791
01:15:23,554 --> 01:15:26,421
Many of the contests where Kelly,
Jeff and Tom take part ...

792
01:15:26,557 --> 01:15:31,187
s? with weak waves.
A wave of day so ...

793
01:15:31,562 --> 01:15:33,860
? almost imposs? vel
any contest.

794
01:15:34,231 --> 01:15:37,860
But this contest? to see
who caught the best wave.

795
01:15:49,079 --> 01:15:53,379
Not bad, travel the world
Surfing and still be paid.

796
01:15:57,087 --> 01:15:59,988
Tom Carroll had his share
incr of waves? ble.

797
01:16:02,026 --> 01:16:05,325
Wearing helmets to protect
the head? the shallow reef ...

798
01:16:05,696 --> 01:16:08,995
Tommy surfed every wave
better than the other.

799
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:13,227
In situations ?? s where at? the best
seek safety? a ...

800
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:15,668
Tommy took a turn ...

801
01:16:16,373 --> 01:16:19,342
and into the tube,
even in the shallows.

802
01:16:37,227 --> 01:16:41,527
Tommy Carroll, the wave
perfect est? in Cloud Break.

803
01:16:57,414 --> 01:16:59,314
This? type of day
that you? dreams.

804
01:16:59,683 --> 01:17:02,311
Perfect waves,
Good size.

805
01:17:03,354 --> 01:17:06,551
One of these days that s?
a surfer understand.

806
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:10,319
You? surf nine hours straight,
It has sunburn ...

807
01:17:10,694 --> 01:17:13,561
the bra? the hurt
to do so is a.

808
01:17:13,697 --> 01:17:16,325
You? It is full of cuts
because the reef ...

809
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,998
and has a big smile
in the face.

810
01:17:22,039 --> 01:17:25,338
? very noisy there,
with the wind in the ear ...

811
01:17:25,709 --> 01:17:28,678
and the thunder of the waves.
But underneath ...

812
01:17:29,046 --> 01:17:33,005
? a different universe,
quiet and beautiful.

813
01:18:30,374 --> 01:18:34,003
Wingnut spent much
time under d '? water.

814
01:18:34,378 --> 01:18:36,346
It took beautiful trambolh? Es.

815
01:18:38,382 --> 01:18:40,009
Tombo!

816
01:18:43,887 --> 01:18:46,856
If you? do not go out of the wave,
? played against the reef ...

817
01:18:47,224 --> 01:18:48,851
and pulverized.

818
01:18:51,895 --> 01:18:56,195
Wingnut do not usually wear belt.
Ali, do not have a choice.

819
01:18:56,567 --> 01:18:58,762
I never heard of belt
that stretched ...

820
01:18:58,902 --> 01:19:01,462
but when Wingnut
eat? or day ...

821
01:19:01,839 --> 01:19:04,467
Belt it badly spent
Plank tip.

822
01:19:04,842 --> 01:19:08,471
After Cloud Break
would al? m plank 3 m.

823
01:19:12,516 --> 01:19:14,814
Note 1 0, Cloud Break ...

824
01:19:15,185 --> 01:19:17,710
Surfing with
Kelly, Jeff and Tom.

825
01:19:17,855 --> 01:19:20,483
N 'may be the best.

826
01:19:28,532 --> 01:19:30,830

827
01:19:31,201 --> 01:19:33,829
to pr? xima stop
in Brisbane, Austr? lia.

828
01:19:35,539 --> 01:19:38,167
Pat was there? when
It was high school ...

829
01:19:38,542 --> 01:19:41,511
and stayed with Nat Young
and his son, Beau.

830
01:19:42,546 --> 01:19:44,514
Pat and Beau
They were old friends ...

831
01:19:44,715 --> 01:19:46,910
and Nat was one of
her? is of Wingnut.

832
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:50,349
Hi, Patty.
Wingnut, pleasure.

01:20:04,568 --> 01:20:06,866

FOR? SO DO SURFlSTA,
A FEW MlNUTOS DAQUl

For 50 cents,

839
01:20:18,248 --> 01:20:21,445
Many construction ?? es, but
beautiful places to surf ...

840
01:20:21,585 --> 01:20:23,212
as Burleigh Heads.

841
01:20:36,934 --> 01:20:39,232
Australian surfing ...

842

and the sea is full.
Overall, surfing and ...

848
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:13,529
as a basketball player
It would be the United States.

849
01:21:14,571 --> 01:21:16,869
When we came to c?
in the 60s ...

850
01:21:17,074 --> 01:21:18,371
Nat was 1 6 years ...

851
01:21:18,742 --> 01:21:21,370
It was one of a handful
good surfers ...

852
01:21:21,745 --> 01:21:24,043
by default? s the? poca.

853
01:21:24,414 --> 01:21:29,044
Was one of the l? Doest
?? the evolution of the short boards.

854
01:21:30,754 --> 01:21:32,619
Friends of Nat call
Animal ...

855
01:21:32,756 --> 01:21:37,386
because it seems
You never get bored.

856
01:21:39,096 --> 01:21:42,065
His son, Beau,
He turned one? surfer thymus.

857
01:21:45,435 --> 01:21:48,734
After 2:30 h,
Pat got a wave.

858
01:21:55,445 --> 01:21:58,073
Wingnut found that
the fund had stones ...

859
01:21:59,383 --> 01:22:01,351
and he was injured.

860
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:05,688
Nat said, '' No it? anything,
I can sew it. ''

861
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:10,258
Wingnut as bleeding,
Nat took it? Ba? A of sharks.

862
01:22:10,394 --> 01:22:12,362
L? do not be full.

863
01:22:12,729 --> 01:22:17,029
Nat said it was because the? Past
1 0 s that? Ram do not come back.

864
01:22:17,401 --> 01:22:19,926
After v? Hist holiday? Rias
that scared ...

865
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:22,698
they were nervous.

866
01:22:35,585 --> 01:22:39,885
When you? est? in Austr? lia,
you? go to the pub. Simple like that.

867
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:43,889
H? a pub for
every two Australians.

868
01:22:46,930 --> 01:22:48,898
Where you? ??

869
01:22:49,099 --> 01:22:51,727
I live in Dana Point, Calif? CALIFORNIA.

870
01:22:55,772 --> 01:23:00,675
You? S still t? M those
damn hippies communities?

871
01:23:01,044 --> 01:23:02,909
In the first week,
I had chicken pox.

872
01:23:03,046 --> 01:23:07,346
-True?
-In My birthday? River, scarlet fever.

873
01:23:08,218 --> 01:23:09,515
But I had fun.

874
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,244
-What ? your name?
-Ruivo.

875
01:23:11,388 --> 01:23:13,015
Wingnut am.

876
01:23:19,730 --> 01:23:23,689
In Austr? Lia h? plates
do not see yourself? nowhere else.

877
01:23:31,074 --> 01:23:35,033
People like koalas
more than they like people.

878
01:23:40,083 --> 01:23:42,608
A lot of animals
strangers l ?.

879
01:23:42,753 --> 01:23:46,052
This? a flying fox,
a fruit bat.

880
01:23:47,424 --> 01:23:49,392
They carry
Your Own? selves blankets.

881
01:23:50,427 --> 01:23:52,395
Nat said they would
? Sweetbreads estimates of the animals ??.

882
01:23:52,763 --> 01:23:56,062
If you want to eat, they pluck
one chunk that of its jugular.

883
01:23:57,434 --> 01:24:00,665
Travel with Nat.
V 'in one spider?

884
01:24:01,371 --> 01:24:03,669
It can kill you? S.
'' Follow me. ''

885
01:24:07,878 --> 01:24:10,176
He? one? thymus guide
for walks in the forest.

886
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:13,008
? better pay attention to ??
in ch? o and do not the snake.

887
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:20,679
A walk through the forest with Nat
becomes a deadly journey.

888
01:24:21,391 --> 01:24:25,691
It takes you to a beautiful place,
and then terrifies you.

889
01:24:33,737 --> 01:24:36,604
No is the March
No problem for Nat.

890
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:40,608
He always an adventure
stored, eating? the dawn.

891
01:24:40,744 --> 01:24:44,043
Come on ?, damn Yankees,
let's raise. Bozo, come on ?.

892
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:48,047
Patrick, come on ?.

893
01:24:48,752 --> 01:24:52,711
He figured float
the river would be a good thing.

894
01:24:52,923 --> 01:24:54,891
Thread the hole.

895
01:24:55,258 --> 01:24:58,227
This? another major plans
Nat to kill us.

896
01:24:58,929 --> 01:25:03,491
I have something else to you? S.
No to be scared ...

897
01:25:03,867 --> 01:25:06,495
-Capacetes?
-? cold.

898
01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:09,168
Why do we need them?
-Only Place.

899
01:25:09,539 --> 01:25:13,498
S? in case
one emerg? INSTANCE. Here we go.

900
01:25:19,549 --> 01:25:22,518
Down the mighty
Nymboida River.

901
01:25:22,886 --> 01:25:25,411
They wore helmets,
saves lives...

902
01:25:25,555 --> 01:25:27,853
but no one had id? ia
what they were doing.

903
01:25:28,225 --> 01:25:30,193
-That do not stop them.
Let's beat?

904
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:34,189
We try to avoid,
but it can happen.

905
01:25:34,564 --> 01:25:37,533
They spent the day
made ping pong balls.

906
01:25:41,571 --> 01:25:44,199
Many often before
see if h? any danger.

907
01:25:44,574 --> 01:25:46,201
They do not bother.

908
01:25:54,918 --> 01:25:57,887
As always, Nat left
smelling of roses.

909
01:26:01,525 --> 01:26:03,823
He blamed
in Wingnut.

910
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:17,829
He would sa? Of the? Water,
but I do not know to stop.

911
01:26:19,876 --> 01:26:22,845
Nat had tamed
the powerful Nymboida.

912
01:26:24,881 --> 01:26:26,849
Good. That? the end
Adventure in the river.

913
01:26:27,217 --> 01:26:32,416
But first, there's one more thing.
The car est? on the road.

914

V? At? l? and bring him back.
Pack your bags and get out of here.

915
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:51,370
No it was going too long without
Nat do not planned anything.

916
01:27:01,017 --> 01:27:04,976
It was pulling, or, in this case,
pulling them through the rear.

917
01:27:25,709 --> 01:27:28,007
No gave to take
Wingnut pl? Stico ...

918
01:27:28,378 --> 01:27:31,006
and he thought of spending
with the car on him.

919
01:27:33,383 --> 01:27:36,352
Nat do not could imagine
because they lived asleep.

920
01:27:38,388 --> 01:27:41,357

That day.

Nat had to climb the crest
a killer wave.

Pat took the best
Wave your life.

After two weeks
adventures with Nat ...

Wingnut do not know if I was dreaming
or he was being tortured.

You think we took the wrong boat?

1004
01:35:03,533 --> 01:35:05,501

Java? thickest place
populated the planet.

1022
01:36:01,858 --> 01:36:05,817
Ironically, the llha-G,
acess? vel only by boat ...

1023
01:36:06,195 --> 01:36:11,155
is a jungle reserve with
a sea frontline.

1024
01:36:12,034 --> 01:36:14,662
This part of the jungle
? called '' Plenkung ''.

01:36:15,037 --> 01:36:19,997
? a national reserve,

Many snakes.

1030
01:36:38,728 --> 01:36:42,596
The lndon? Asia has more snakes
poisonous than anywhere else.

1031
01:36:42,732 --> 01:36:47,362
I learned this at the Museum Griffith Park,
a ?? the exhibition of snakes.

1032

In March low, you? can

1033

Gerry and his friend first saw
this wave of a plane? the ...

1034
01:37:07,023 --> 01:37:10,652
in a v? o to Bali.
They wondered where it was ...

1035
01:37:11,027 --> 01:37:13,655
and after much difficulty,
l arrived ?.

1036

He has returned to
friends of Maui ...

01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:23,737
The a surfer
of Calif? CALIFORNIA do not give ...

1039
01:37:23,873 --> 01:37:27,832
to surf with Gerry Lopez
and Laird Hamilton in llha-G?

1040
01:37:33,216 --> 01:37:36,515
Pat took a lot
of? Optimal waves.

1041

This? In one? mere waves
Wingnut of the llha-G.

1042

Gerry uses? Polaroid glasses to
protect the view of reflection ...

1043
01:38:14,690 --> 01:38:18,649
because he usually stays
the? water 8-1 0 hours.

1044
01:38:21,030 --> 01:38:23,225
Gerry? known
as' Mr. Tube '...

1045
01:38:23,366 --> 01:38:27,564
because it established a style
surfing waves in dif? ficult.

1046
01:38:27,703 --> 01:38:30,672
He was the surfer by which
all others were measured.

1047
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,008
Here's what Laird
You have to say about Gerry.

1048
01:38:34,210 --> 01:38:36,735
What brought Gerry
for this sport ...

1049
01:38:36,879 --> 01:38:40,406
? the ability to do things
seem t? f? ficult ...

1051

Gerry is happy only
Surfing and living.

1052
01:38:50,559 --> 01:38:53,084
It could be the contr? River,
j? that he...

1053
01:38:53,229 --> 01:38:56,096
all surfed perfect waves,
whenever were good ...

1054
01:38:56,232 --> 01:38:59,463
and it could be as
uninterested in all of us.

1055
01:38:59,835 --> 01:39:03,134
But? the contr? river.
He? the most enthusiastic.

1056
01:39:07,009 --> 01:39:11,969
Gerry Lopez was one of the surfers
pioneers in lndon? sia.

1057
01:39:13,015 --> 01:39:17,315

A surfer named Mad?
? other protected from Lopez.

1062
01:39:38,374 --> 01:39:42,003
Mad? ? Hindu, and they t? m
the habit of grinding teeth.

1063
01:39:42,378 --> 01:39:44,346
And do not with local dentists.

1064
01:39:44,547 --> 01:39:47,175
I told them about my teeth.

1065
01:39:48,217 --> 01:39:50,185
They screwed my teeth
with metal sandpaper.

1066
01:39:51,554 --> 01:39:52,851
E d? I?

1067

1068
01:39:58,561 --> 01:40:01,530
No the d? to make noise
with his mouth open.

1069
01:40:01,897 --> 01:40:05,526
They do this because?
a Hindu thing?

1070
01:40:05,901 --> 01:40:11,533
When you 1 6 years? when
your fam? lia does CERIM? nia.

1071
01:40:11,907 --> 01:40:16,105
Or when they do? dies
before being buried.

1072
01:40:16,245 --> 01:40:18,213
Rather more when it dies.

1073
01:40:21,917 --> 01:40:25,216
Laird Hamilton?
impressive in? water.

1074
01:40:27,256 --> 01:40:30,555
Billy's father Laird was
a great surfer in the 60s.

1075
01:40:30,926 --> 01:40:33,895
Laird? one nostalgic

They are good swimmers ...

1077
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:42,230
divers and paddlers:
They did everything in? water.

1078
01:40:42,438 --> 01:40:44,736
Laird has its pr? Pippen priorities.

1079
01:40:45,107 --> 01:40:47,632
I'd rather be in a bad March
with my friends...

1080
01:40:47,777 --> 01:40:50,405
than a good with idiots.

1081

But, usually one day
Sea good you? est? alone.

1082
01:41:02,892 --> 01:41:05,861
Laird makes things interesting
at sea...

1086

LSSO after accepting

Another thing that makes Laird? windsurfing
on Maui, where he lives.

1092
01:41:42,932 --> 01:41:46,459
We sail between the islands,
which? very cool.

1093
01:41:46,602 --> 01:41:47,796
Really?

1094
01:41:47,937 --> 01:41:51,566
-How long does it take?
-When Reached 60 ...

1095

70 km / h,

1096
01:41:54,276 --> 01:41:59,509
Maui to Oahu, which is
the first 90 km, we in five hours.

1097
01:42:07,890 --> 01:42:10,188
You? can find

tows and others in waves
too big to paddle.

1103
01:42:27,576 --> 01:42:29,874
Think about it for a minute.

1104
01:42:30,246 --> 01:42:32,874
A big wave too
to go paddling.

1105
01:42:33,249 --> 01:42:36,548
In this case, used
a jet sky as tow.
