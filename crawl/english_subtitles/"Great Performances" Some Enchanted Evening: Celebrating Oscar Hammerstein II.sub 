{3927}{3984}Don't be afraid. Call now.
{4063}{4174}- Hello.|I'd like to talk to Dr. Monroe.|- First name, age, problem?
{4174}{4282}I'm Marge, 34,|and my problem is my husband.
{4284}{4358}He doesn't listen to me.|He doesn't appreciate me.
{4361}{4409}I don't know how much more|of this I can--
{4411}{4476}Save your whining for when|you're on the air, okay?
{4569}{4634}Okay, let's see.|Next we have Marge.
{4637}{4706}She's 34 and trapped in|a loveless sham of a marriage.
{4708}{4788}Hey, turn it up.|I love hearing those wackos.
{4790}{4869}- Tell me 'bout your husband, Marge.|- Well--
{4869}{4936}When we were dating,|he was sweeter...
{4939}{5003}and more romantic and 40 pounds thinner,
{5006}{5073}and he had hair,|and he ate with utensils.
{5123}{5205}-What was that last thing you said? Ah.
{5207}{5253}Isn't that your wife, Homer?
{5255}{5325}Don't be ridiculous.|My wife worships the ground I walk on.
{5327}{5437}Marge,|it's what I call "harsh reality time."
{5440}{5490}Your husband sees you as nothing.
{5492}{5593}- Oh. Okay. Well, thank you.|- No, no, no, don't hang up.
{5596}{5653}The pig has made you|into his mother.
{5655}{5730}You are not the hot love object|you deserve to be.
{5730}{5811}- Really?|- I'm as sure of it as I'm sure|my voice is annoying.
{5811}{5886}Tonight, the second|he comes through that front door,
{5888}{5998}you've got to tell him you're fed up,|and if he doesn't start loving,|you will be leaving.
{6001}{6049}Leave Homer?
{6049}{6099}- Don't use his real name!|- Leave Pedro?
{6166}{6212}- Can you be that honest?|- Yeah.
{6212}{6286}- You'll tell him right when|he comes home from work.|- Yeah!
{6286}{6368}- Say it likeyou mean it.|- Yeah!

{7804}{7888}- Marge is right. You are a pig.|You can ask anyone in this bar.|- What?

{8219}{8283}Except for one difference.
{8286}{8350}Once in a while,|we can crawl out of the slop,
{8350}{8425}hose ourselves off|and act like human beings.
{8427}{8525}Homer, buy your wife some flowers and|take her out for a night on the town.
{8528}{8597}Candles, table cloth,|the whole nine yards.
{8597}{8700}Gee, a romantic evening.|Nah, she's too smart to fall for that.
{8703}{8751}I'm not done. After dinner,
{8753}{8844}the two of you are going to check|into the fanciest motel in town...
{8847}{8971}and not check out until|the next morning, if you get my drift.
{8974}{9048}I read you loud and clear.|Heh, heh, heh, heh!

{17174}{17250}And you're gonna do what I say,|or I'm gonna do something to you.
{17253}{17370}And I don't know what that is, because|eveybody has always done what I say.
{17519}{17576}They all look so tasty,
{17579}{17648}but I think I'll eat|this one right there.
{17651}{17749}- Why don't you pick one|that's a little more frisky, sir.|- Why?
{17751}{17819}Well, when you choose one|that's floating upside down,
{17819}{17915}it somewhat defeats the purpose|ofselecting a live lobster.
{17917}{18030}Oh, okay. Then I'll take|that one there with the beady eyes.
{18030}{18116}Excellent choice, sir.|May I lead you to your table?

{18986}{19044}Relax. This is cinema verite.
{19046}{19125}When the brutal, slow-motion killing|starts, I'll tell you to shut your eyes.
{19125}{19231}The Cue Ball Killer should be considered|extremely armed and dangerous.
{19233}{19329}if you think you've seen him,|call 1 -800-U-SQUEAL.
{19332}{19389}Homer, you look just like a little boy.
{19391}{19487}- 'Cause I'm so care free?|- No, because you're wearing a bib.

{19679}{19727}Whoops. Time for a fill-up.
{19730}{19825}Garcon! Another bottle of|your second-least-expensive champagne.
{19828}{19895}The defenseless youngsters were tied up|and gagged in the living room...
{19897}{19955}while the bandit roamed|through the house at will,
{19957}{20063}stealing the valuable objects it took|the family a lifetime to shop for.
{20487}{20583}You know, Marge,|this is just like when we were dating.
{20585}{20677}Except for one thing--|no chaperone.
{20679}{20725}Ho, ho, hoo!
{20727}{20811}The Baby-sitter Bandit has left a trail|ofher daring nighttime robberies...
{20813}{20861}across the continental|United States.

{23146}{23204}Oh! Homemade pickled beets.
{23249}{23309}Go ahead. Take 'em all.
