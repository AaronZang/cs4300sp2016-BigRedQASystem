00:00:31,772 --> 00:00:34,570
Two households, both alike in dignity,

3
00:00:34,652 --> 00:00:37,724
in fair Verona, where we lay ourscene,

4
00:00:37,812 --> 00:00:40,884
from ancientgrudge
break to newmutiny,

5
00:00:40,972 --> 00:00:44,089
where civilblood
makes civilhands unclean.

6
00:00:44,172 --> 00:00:46,925
From forth the fatalloins
of these two foes,

7
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:50,004
a pair ofstar-cross'dlovers
take their life;

8
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:52,652
whose misadventured
piteous overthrows

9
00:00:52,732 --> 00:00:55,929
doth with their death
bury theirparents'strife.

10
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:58,765
The fearfulpassage
of their death-mark'dlove

11
00:00:58,852 --> 00:01:01,525
and the continuance
of theirparents'rage,

12
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:05,366
which, but their children's end,
nought couldremove,

13
00:01:05,452 --> 00:01:08,091
is now the two hours' traffiic
of ourstage.

14
00:01:26,932 --> 00:01:29,571
Two households,

15
00:01:29,652 --> 00:01:31,722
both alike in dignity,

16
00:01:31,812 --> 00:01:35,282
in fair Verona, where we lay ourscene,

from ancientgrudge

00:01:40,452 --> 00:01:44,764
where civilblood

19
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:52,051
From forth the fatalloins
of these two foes,

00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:58,007
a pair ofstar-cross'dlovers
take their life.

21
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:38,682
A dog ofthe house of Capulet
moves me!

22
00:02:44,972 --> 00:02:46,963
Pedlar's excrement!

23
00:02:47,052 --> 00:02:50,328
King Urinal! Go rot!

24
00:02:50,932 --> 00:02:52,888
The boys! The boys!

25
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:10,206
- The quarrel is between our masters.
- And us their men!

26
00:03:33,092 --> 00:03:37,210
Hubble, bubble, toil and trouble!

27
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:41,251
And lam a prettypiece offlesh!

28
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:42,811
l am...

29
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:47,443
a pretty piece offlesh!

30
00:03:51,852 --> 00:03:55,561
- Here comes ofthe house of Capulet!
- Quarrel, l will back thee.

31
00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:19,082
l will bite my thumb at them, which is
a disgrace to them, ifthey bear it.

32
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:37,450
Go forth! l will back thee!

33
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:42,370
- Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
- l... l do bite my thumb, sir.

34
00:04:42,452 --> 00:04:44,522
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

35
00:04:44,612 --> 00:04:47,046
- ls the law of our side if l say ay?
- No!

36
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:50,204
No, sir, l do not bite my thumb at you, sir,
but l bite my thumb, sir!

37
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:53,204
- Do you quarrel, sir?
- Quarrel, sir? No, sir!

38
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:56,204
But ifyou do, sir, l am for you.
l serve as good a man as you.

39
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:57,247
No better?

40
00:04:58,292 --> 00:05:00,328
Here comes our kinsman. Say better!

41
00:05:00,412 --> 00:05:02,164
- Yes, sir, better!
- You lie!

42
00:05:02,732 --> 00:05:04,324
Draw, ifyou be men!

43
00:05:07,812 --> 00:05:09,609
Part, fools! You know not what you do.

44
00:05:16,772 --> 00:05:18,285
Put up your Swords!

45
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:51,209
What, art thou drawn
among these... heartless hinds?

46
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:55,003
Turn thee, Benvolio,

47
00:05:56,212 --> 00:05:58,851
and look upon thy death.

48
00:05:59,852 --> 00:06:01,843
l do but keep the peace.

49
00:06:01,932 --> 00:06:03,888
Put up thy Sword,

50
00:06:03,972 --> 00:06:06,486
or manage it to part these men with me.

51
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:08,723
Peace?

52
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:11,003
Peace?

53
00:06:11,092 --> 00:06:13,083
l hate the word...

54
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:16,044
as l hate hell,

55
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:17,850
all Montagues,

56
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:22,727
and thee.

57
00:06:22,812 --> 00:06:24,211
Bang bang!

58
00:06:25,972 --> 00:06:26,643
Bang.

59
00:06:57,692 --> 00:06:59,648
- Come forth! Come!
- Wait!

60
00:07:04,572 --> 00:07:06,642
Come forth!

61
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:13,201
From ancientgrudge
break to newmutiny...

62
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,162
Do not proceed!

63
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,163
Give me my Longsword, ho!

64
00:08:28,252 --> 00:08:30,846
Thou shalt not stir one foot
to seek a foe.

65
00:08:38,732 --> 00:08:40,529
Rebellious subjects,

66
00:08:40,612 --> 00:08:42,330
enemies to peace!

67
00:08:42,412 --> 00:08:44,482
Throw your mistemper'd weapons
to the ground!

68
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,844
On pain oftorture,

69
00:08:47,932 --> 00:08:52,722
from those bloody hands throw your
mistemper'd weapons to the ground!

70
00:08:54,172 --> 00:08:56,640
Three civil brawls,

71
00:08:56,732 --> 00:09:00,327
bred of an airy word by thee,
old Capulet, and Montague,

72
00:09:00,412 --> 00:09:03,324
have thrice disturbed
the quiet of our streets.

73
00:09:04,492 --> 00:09:07,689
lf ever you disturb our streets again,

74
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:11,762
your lives shall pay
the forfeit ofthe peace.

75
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,966
O where is Romeo? Saw you him today?

76
00:09:29,012 --> 00:09:31,651
Right glad l am he was not at this fray.

77
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:35,171
Madam, underneath the Grove
of Sycamore,

78
00:09:35,252 --> 00:09:37,971
so early walking did l see your son.

79
00:09:38,052 --> 00:09:40,247
Many a morning
hath he there been seen,

80
00:09:40,332 --> 00:09:43,244
with tears augmenting
the fresh morning's dew.

81
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,608
Away from light
steals home my heavy son,

82
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:50,002
and private in his chamber
pens himself,

83
00:09:50,092 --> 00:09:52,083
shuts up his windows,

84
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:56,962
locks fair daylight out,
and makes himself an artificial night.

85
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:09,045
Why, then...

86
00:10:09,132 --> 00:10:13,205
O brawling love, O loving hate!

87
00:10:14,012 --> 00:10:17,368
O anything ofnothing fiirst create!

88
00:10:17,452 --> 00:10:19,283
Heavy lightness,

89
00:10:19,372 --> 00:10:21,363
serious vanity.

90
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:25,364
Misshapen chaos ofwell-seeming forms.

91
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:15,802
Black and portentous
must this humour prove...

92
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:20,724
unless good counsel
may the cause remove.

93
00:11:22,572 --> 00:11:24,563
So please you, step aside.

94
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:30,124
l'll know his grievance
or be much denied.

95
00:11:30,812 --> 00:11:32,803
Come, madam, let's away.

96
00:11:46,492 --> 00:11:48,483
Good morrow, cousin.

97
00:11:49,372 --> 00:11:51,363
ls the day so young?

98
00:11:51,452 --> 00:11:53,522
But new struck, coz.

99
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:56,243
Ay me, sad hours seem long.

100
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:01,926
Was that my father that went hence so fast?

101
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,048
lt was.

102
00:12:04,132 --> 00:12:05,804
What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

103
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,962
Not having that
which having makes them short.

104
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:09,280
- ln love?
- Out.

105
00:12:09,372 --> 00:12:11,647
- Of love?
- Out of her favour where l am in love.

106
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,768
Alas that love,
so gentle in his view,

107
00:12:13,852 --> 00:12:16,082
should be so tyrannous
and rough in proof.

108
00:12:16,172 --> 00:12:18,640
Alas that love,
whose view is muffled still,

109
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:21,371
should without eyes
see pathways to his will.

110
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:23,363
Where shall we dine?

111
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:24,362
..this costlyblood.

112
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,603
Never angermade goodguardforitself.

113
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:28,807
The lawhath notbeen dead...

114
00:12:28,892 --> 00:12:30,803
O me! What fray was here?

115
00:12:30,892 --> 00:12:33,201
- Coz, l...
- Yet tell me not, for l've heard it all.

116
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:35,852
Here's much to do with hate,
but more with love.

117
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:38,162
Why, then, O brawling love,
O loving hate!

118
00:12:38,252 --> 00:12:40,163
O anything of nothing first create!

119
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:42,766
O heavy lightness, serious vanity!

120
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:45,446
Misshapen chaos ofwell-seeming forms!

121
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,568
Feather of lead, br...

122
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:50,803
Dost thou not laugh?

123
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:53,128
No, coz, l rather weep.

124
00:12:53,212 --> 00:12:55,203
Good heart, at what?

125
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:58,723
- At thy good heart's oppression.
- Farewell, my coz.

126
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:02,600
Soft, l will go along. And ifyou
leave me so, you do me wrong.

127
00:13:09,972 --> 00:13:13,362
But Montague is bound as well as l,
in penalty alike.

128
00:13:13,452 --> 00:13:16,922
And 'tis not hard, l think, for men
as old as we to keep the peace.

129
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:20,368
Of honourable reckoning are you both,
and pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.

130
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:22,682
But now, my lord,
what say you to my suit?

131
00:13:22,772 --> 00:13:27,721
But saying o'er what l have said before:
my child is yet a stranger in the world.

132
00:13:27,812 --> 00:13:31,805
Let two more summers wither in their pride
ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

133
00:13:31,892 --> 00:13:33,689
Younger than she are happy mothers made.

134
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:37,003
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.

135
00:13:37,172 --> 00:13:39,447
This night l hold an old accustom'd feast.

136
00:13:39,532 --> 00:13:41,966
At my poor house look to behold this night

137
00:13:42,052 --> 00:13:45,522
fresh female buds
that make dark heaven light.

138
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,083
Hear all, all see,

139
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:51,084
and like her most
whose merit most shall be.

140
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:52,685
Come, go with me.

141
00:13:53,812 --> 00:13:56,042
Tell me in sadness,
who is it that you love?

142
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:58,202
ln sadness, cousin, l do love a woman.

143
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:01,170
l aim'd so near when l supposed you loved.

144
00:14:01,732 --> 00:14:04,246
A right good marksman!
And she's fair l love.

145
00:14:04,332 --> 00:14:07,369
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

146
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:11,602
Well, in that hit you miss.
She'll not be hit with Cupid's arrow;

147
00:14:11,692 --> 00:14:14,081
nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,

148
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:16,561
nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.

149
00:14:16,652 --> 00:14:19,325
Then she hath sworn
that she will still live chaste?

150
00:14:19,412 --> 00:14:22,006
She hath, and in that sparing
makes huge waste.

151
00:14:22,092 --> 00:14:25,687
- Be ruled by me. Forget to think of her.
- Teach me how l should forget to think.

152
00:14:25,772 --> 00:14:28,605
By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
Examine other beauties.

153
00:14:29,372 --> 00:14:31,283
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

154
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:33,966
Not mad,
but bound more than a madman is.

155
00:14:34,052 --> 00:14:37,249
Shut up in prison, kept without
my food, whipp'd and tormented.

156
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:38,242
Good day, good fellow.

157
00:14:40,932 --> 00:14:42,684
Now, l'll tellyou withoutasking.

158
00:14:42,772 --> 00:14:46,242
The greatrich Capulet
holds an oldaccustom'dfeast.

159
00:14:46,332 --> 00:14:49,290
A fairassembly. SignorPlacentio
and his wife and daughters,

160
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:53,888
the lady widow ofUtruvio,
and herlovelynieces Rosaline...

161
00:14:53,972 --> 00:14:56,770
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
sups the fair Rosaline,

162
00:14:56,852 --> 00:14:59,286
whom thou so loves,
with all the admired beauties ofVerona.

163
00:14:59,372 --> 00:15:03,285
lfyou be not ofthe House ofMontague,
come and crush a cup ofwine!

164
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:05,647
Go thither, and with unattainted eye

165
00:15:05,732 --> 00:15:08,451
compare her face with some
that l shall show,

166
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,251
and l will make thee think thy swan a crow.

167
00:15:11,332 --> 00:15:13,800
l'll go along, no such sight to be shown,

168
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:16,486
but to rejoice in splendour of mine own.

169
00:15:21,732 --> 00:15:25,281
Juliet!

170
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:29,006
Juliet!

171
00:15:29,332 --> 00:15:31,129
Juliet!

172
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:32,881
Juliet!

173
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:42,645
Nurse!

174
00:15:42,732 --> 00:15:44,848
Nurse, where's my daughter?
Call her forth to me.

175
00:15:44,932 --> 00:15:46,729
l bade her come. God forbid!

176
00:15:48,412 --> 00:15:50,289
Julieta!

177
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:55,521
Juliet!

178
00:15:56,732 --> 00:15:58,370
Juliet!

179
00:16:00,452 --> 00:16:03,842
Juliet!

180
00:16:03,932 --> 00:16:06,002
Madam, l am here. What is your will?

181
00:16:08,812 --> 00:16:11,645
O nurse, give us leave awhile.
We must talk in secret.

182
00:16:13,412 --> 00:16:16,688
Nurse, come back again!
l have remembered me.

183
00:16:16,772 --> 00:16:18,683
Thou's hear our counsel.

184
00:16:18,772 --> 00:16:21,923
Nurse, thou knowest
my daughter's of a pretty age.

185
00:16:22,012 --> 00:16:24,207
Thou wast the prettiest babe
that e'er l nursed.

186
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:27,284
By my count, l was your mother
much upon these years.

187
00:16:29,372 --> 00:16:31,363
You are now a maid.

188
00:16:31,452 --> 00:16:33,443
Thus then in brief!

189
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:36,970
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

190
00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:39,403
A man, young lady!

191
00:16:39,492 --> 00:16:42,962
Lady, such a man as all the world.
Why, he's a man ofwax!

192
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:45,486
Verona's summer hath not such a flower...

193
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:47,688
Nay, he's a flower. ln faith, a very flower...

194
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:48,727
Nurse!

195
00:16:48,812 --> 00:16:50,643
This night you shall behold him at our feast.

196
00:16:50,732 --> 00:16:54,088
Read o'er the volume ofyoung Paris' face
and find delight writ there

197
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:55,685
with beauty's pen.

198
00:16:55,772 --> 00:16:59,606
This... precious book of love,
this unbound lover,

199
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:02,160
to beautify him, only lacks a cover.

200
00:17:02,252 --> 00:17:04,891
So shall you share all that he doth possess,

201
00:17:04,972 --> 00:17:07,850
by having him making yourself no less.

202
00:17:09,372 --> 00:17:11,328
Nay, bigger. Women grow by men.

203
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:21,486
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris's love?

204
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:24,484
l'll look to like, if looking liking move.

205
00:17:24,572 --> 00:17:26,642
But no more deep will l endart mine eye

206
00:17:26,732 --> 00:17:29,246
than your consent gives strength
to make it fly.

207
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:33,885
Madam, the guests are come.

208
00:17:33,972 --> 00:17:35,166
Go!

209
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:36,731
We follow thee.

210
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:39,966
Juliet!

211
00:17:46,492 --> 00:17:49,689
Go, girl. Seek happy nights to happy days.

212
00:18:36,132 --> 00:18:38,202
You taffeta punk!

213
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:40,487
Die a beggar!

214
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:01,249
Sharing this one and only life

215
00:19:01,332 --> 00:19:05,450
Ending up just another
lost and lonely wife

216
00:19:05,532 --> 00:19:06,806
You count up the years

217
00:19:06,892 --> 00:19:10,680
And they willbe fiilled with tears

218
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,883
Young hearts

219
00:19:14,972 --> 00:19:17,122
Run free

220
00:19:17,212 --> 00:19:18,088
Never be hung up

221
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:23,242
Like Rosaline and thee

222
00:19:24,612 --> 00:19:27,080
Nay, gentle Romeo,
we must have you dance.

223
00:19:27,172 --> 00:19:28,605
Not l. Not l, believe me.

224
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:32,048
You have dancing shoes with
nimble soles. l have a soul of lead.

225
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:33,406
You are a lover.

226
00:19:33,492 --> 00:19:36,086
Borrow Cupid's wings and soar
with them above a common bound.

227
00:19:36,172 --> 00:19:38,367
Under love's heavy burden do l sink.

228
00:19:39,092 --> 00:19:41,845
Too great oppression for a tender thing.

229
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:43,490
ls love a tender thing? lt is too rough,

230
00:19:43,572 --> 00:19:46,405
too rude, too boisterous,
and it pricks like thorn.

231
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:48,608
lf love be rough with you, be rough with love.

232
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:51,525
Prick love for pricking,
and you beat love down.

233
00:19:53,412 --> 00:19:55,801
Every man, betake him to his legs!

234
00:19:55,892 --> 00:19:58,645
Come, we burn daylight, ho!

235
00:20:00,052 --> 00:20:03,010
- But 'tis no wit to go!
- Why, may one ask?

236
00:20:03,092 --> 00:20:05,083
- l dreamt a dream tonight.
- And so did l.

237
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:07,527
- And what was yours?
- That dreamers often lie.

238
00:20:07,612 --> 00:20:10,080
ln bed asleep,
while they do dream things true.

239
00:20:10,172 --> 00:20:13,721
O! Then l see
Queen Mab hath been with you.

240
00:20:14,532 --> 00:20:16,250
She is the fairies' midwife,

241
00:20:16,332 --> 00:20:19,165
and she comes in shape
no bigger than an agate-stone

242
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:22,403
on the forefinger of an alderman,

243
00:20:22,492 --> 00:20:25,962
drawn with a team of little atomies

244
00:20:26,812 --> 00:20:29,724
over men's noses as they lie asleep.

245
00:20:30,492 --> 00:20:33,609
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,

246
00:20:34,612 --> 00:20:38,207
her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat.

247
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:43,605
And in this state she gallops
night by night through lovers' brains,

248
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:45,683
and then they dream of...

249
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:47,641
love;

250
00:20:47,732 --> 00:20:50,883
o'er lawyers' fingers,
who straight dream on fees.

251
00:20:50,972 --> 00:20:53,440
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,

252
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:56,683
and then dreams he
of cutting foreign throats;

253
00:20:56,772 --> 00:21:00,560
and, being thus frighted, swears
a prayer or two, and sleeps again.

254
00:21:00,652 --> 00:21:04,531
This is the hag,
when maids lie on their backs,

255
00:21:04,612 --> 00:21:08,571
that presses them
and learns them first to bear,

256
00:21:08,652 --> 00:21:12,008
making them women of good carriage!

257
00:21:12,092 --> 00:21:13,571
This is she!

258
00:21:14,012 --> 00:21:16,731
This is she!

259
00:21:28,212 --> 00:21:30,089
Peace, good Mercutio, peace!

260
00:21:31,132 --> 00:21:33,123
Thou talk'st of nothing.

261
00:21:35,492 --> 00:21:37,483
True.

262
00:21:39,452 --> 00:21:41,443
l talk of dreams,

263
00:21:41,532 --> 00:21:44,649
which are the children of an idle brain,

264
00:21:44,732 --> 00:21:47,371
begot of nothing but vain fantasy;

265
00:21:47,452 --> 00:21:52,287
which is as thin of substance as the air
and more inconstant than the wind,

266
00:21:52,372 --> 00:21:55,170
who woos even now
the frozen bosom ofthe north,

267
00:21:55,252 --> 00:21:57,925
and, being angered,
puffs away from thence,

268
00:21:58,012 --> 00:22:00,651
turning aside to the dew-dropping south.

269
00:22:00,732 --> 00:22:03,724
This wind you talk of
blows us from ourselves!

270
00:22:03,812 --> 00:22:06,804
Supper is done, and we shall come too late!

271
00:22:07,052 --> 00:22:09,043
l fear, too early.

272
00:22:09,132 --> 00:22:14,604
For my mind misgives some... consequence,
yet hanging in the stars,

273
00:22:15,932 --> 00:22:19,925
shall bitterly begin his fearful date
with this night's revels,

274
00:22:20,012 --> 00:22:22,003
and expire the term...

275
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:25,880
of a despised life closed within my breast...

276
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,604
by some vile forfeit of untimely death.

277
00:22:32,412 --> 00:22:35,006
But he that hath the steerage of my course

278
00:22:36,332 --> 00:22:38,004
direct my sail!

279
00:22:49,932 --> 00:22:51,729
On, lusty gentlemen!

280
00:23:28,932 --> 00:23:30,729
Thy drugs are quick.

281
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:06,682
l have seen the day that l could tell

282
00:24:06,772 --> 00:24:09,889
a whispering tale in a fair lady's ear
such as would please.

283
00:24:09,972 --> 00:24:11,769
Amore! Amore!

284
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:12,921
Amore...

285
00:24:54,292 --> 00:25:01,368
Pride can standa thousand trials

286
00:25:01,652 --> 00:25:07,124
The strong willneverfall

287
00:25:08,012 --> 00:25:13,803
But watching stars without you

288
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:18,249
My soul cried

289
00:25:22,172 --> 00:25:27,326
Heaving heart

290
00:25:27,412 --> 00:25:34,727
ls full ofpain

291
00:25:36,132 --> 00:25:42,287
Oh, oh

292
00:25:42,372 --> 00:25:49,448
The aching

293
00:25:51,492 --> 00:26:01,083
Cos l'm kissingyou

294
00:26:01,172 --> 00:26:05,245
Oh

295
00:26:05,332 --> 00:26:18,882
l'm kissingyou

296
00:26:18,972 --> 00:26:20,963
Madam, your mother calls!

297
00:26:21,052 --> 00:26:24,249
Touch me deep

298
00:26:25,332 --> 00:26:32,204
Pure and true

299
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,647
Will you now deny to dance?

300
00:26:36,732 --> 00:26:39,326
A man, young lady. Such a man!

301
00:26:50,132 --> 00:26:51,326
What!

302
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:55,007
Dares that slave come hither
to fleer and scorn at our solemnity?

303
00:26:55,092 --> 00:26:59,961
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
to strike him dead l hold it not a sin!

304
00:27:00,572 --> 00:27:03,291
Why, how now, kinsman!
Wherefore storm you so?

305
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:06,284
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo.
A Montague, our foe.

306
00:27:06,372 --> 00:27:08,363
- Romeo is it?
- 'Tis he.

307
00:27:08,452 --> 00:27:11,444
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.

308
00:27:11,532 --> 00:27:13,887
l would not for the wealth of all this town

309
00:27:13,972 --> 00:27:16,281
here in my house do him disparagement.

310
00:27:16,372 --> 00:27:18,806
Therefore be patient, take no note of him.

311
00:27:18,892 --> 00:27:20,211
Uncle, l'll not endure him.

312
00:27:21,372 --> 00:27:23,363
He shall be endured.

313
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:25,441
Go to!

314
00:27:25,532 --> 00:27:27,762
What, goodman boy? l say he shall!

315
00:27:27,852 --> 00:27:29,001
Go to!

316
00:27:29,092 --> 00:27:30,684
Uncle, 'tis a shame.

317
00:27:30,772 --> 00:27:32,603
Make a mutiny among my guests?

318
00:27:50,972 --> 00:27:52,724
Did my heart love till now?

319
00:27:53,732 --> 00:27:55,723
Forswear it, sight.

320
00:27:55,812 --> 00:27:58,770
For l never saw true beauty till this night.

321
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:09,801
Where are you now?

322
00:28:10,652 --> 00:28:21,483
Where are you now?

323
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:37,206
Cos l'm kissingyou

324
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:54,289
l'm kissingyou now

325
00:29:17,212 --> 00:29:20,363
lf l profane with my unworthiest hand
this holy shrine,

326
00:29:20,452 --> 00:29:22,443
the gentle sin is this.

327
00:29:28,052 --> 00:29:31,601
My lips, two blushing pilgrims,
ready stand

328
00:29:31,692 --> 00:29:35,446
to smooth that rough touch
with a tender kiss.

329
00:29:35,812 --> 00:29:38,485
Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much,

330
00:29:38,572 --> 00:29:40,847
which mannerly devotion shows in this.

331
00:29:40,932 --> 00:29:44,971
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch,

332
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:48,328
and palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

333
00:29:48,812 --> 00:29:52,248
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

334
00:29:52,772 --> 00:29:56,082
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

335
00:29:56,612 --> 00:29:59,285
Well, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.

336
00:29:59,372 --> 00:30:02,603
They pray, grant thou,
lest faith turn to despair.

337
00:30:02,692 --> 00:30:06,571
Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.

338
00:30:07,252 --> 00:30:10,085
Then move not,
while my prayer's effect l take.

339
00:30:14,452 --> 00:30:15,089
Dave!

340
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:29,164
Thus from my lips,
by thine, my sin is purged.

341
00:30:29,252 --> 00:30:31,208
Then have my lips the sin
that they have took?

342
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:34,011
Sin from my lips?
O trespass sweetly urged!

343
00:30:34,092 --> 00:30:35,650
Give me my sin again.

344
00:30:38,372 --> 00:30:40,363
You kiss by the book.

345
00:30:47,732 --> 00:30:49,609
Juliet! Juliet! Oh!

346
00:30:49,892 --> 00:30:51,484
Juliet?

347
00:30:52,132 --> 00:30:53,281
Juliet!

348
00:31:02,052 --> 00:31:04,885
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

349
00:31:06,692 --> 00:31:08,284
Come, let's away!

350
00:31:34,252 --> 00:31:36,447
ls she a Capulet?

351
00:31:38,132 --> 00:31:41,169
His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague,

352
00:31:41,252 --> 00:31:43,720
the only son ofyour great enemy.

353
00:32:02,812 --> 00:32:05,724
Away, be gone. The sport is at its best.

354
00:32:06,212 --> 00:32:08,726
Ay, so l fear. The more is my unrest.

355
00:32:39,812 --> 00:32:44,044
l am a prettypiece offlesh!

356
00:32:44,292 --> 00:32:48,922
l am a prettypiece offlesh!

357
00:32:49,252 --> 00:32:54,042
l am a pretty piece offlesh! l am!

358
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:04,931
My only love sprung from my only hate!

359
00:33:05,812 --> 00:33:08,884
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!

360
00:33:08,972 --> 00:33:13,841
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
that l must love a loathed enemy.

361
00:33:26,252 --> 00:33:28,322
l will withdraw.

362
00:33:28,412 --> 00:33:31,848
But this intrusion shall,
now seeming sweet,

363
00:33:31,932 --> 00:33:34,321
convert to bitterest gall.

364
00:33:37,772 --> 00:33:40,286
A pretty piece offlesh! l am!

365
00:33:42,132 --> 00:33:44,646
A pretty piece of...

366
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:45,721
Romeo!

367
00:33:45,812 --> 00:33:47,609
- Romeo!
- Romeo!

368
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,647
Romeo!

369
00:33:48,772 --> 00:33:51,161
Humours! Madman!

370
00:33:51,412 --> 00:33:54,006
Passion! Lover!

371
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,330
l will conjure thee
by Rosaline's bright eyes,

372
00:33:57,412 --> 00:34:00,370
by her high forehead
and her scarlet lip,

373
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:04,491
by her fine foot, straight leg,
and quivering thigh!

374
00:34:08,132 --> 00:34:12,410
O Romeo, that she were an open-ass
and thou a poperin pear!

375
00:34:12,492 --> 00:34:14,926
He jests at scars that never felt the wound.

376
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:15,683
Romeo!

377
00:34:16,892 --> 00:34:17,961
Good night!

378
00:34:18,052 --> 00:34:22,523
l'll to my truckle-bed.
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.

379
00:34:59,772 --> 00:35:01,444
But soft!

380
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,762
What light through yonder window breaks?

381
00:35:09,572 --> 00:35:11,563
lt is the east,

382
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:14,405
and Juliet is the sun!

383
00:35:18,212 --> 00:35:21,841
Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon,

384
00:35:21,932 --> 00:35:24,526
who is already sick and pale with grief

385
00:35:24,612 --> 00:35:28,400
that thou, her maid,
art far more fair than she.

386
00:35:28,492 --> 00:35:31,564
Be not her maid, since she is envious.

387
00:35:31,652 --> 00:35:35,850
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
and none but fools do wear it.

388
00:35:38,092 --> 00:35:40,970
O cast it off!

389
00:35:49,812 --> 00:35:52,201
lt is my lady, it is my love.

390
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,683
O that she knew she were.

391
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:03,286
Ay me!

392
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,363
She speaks.

393
00:36:08,452 --> 00:36:10,443
Speak again, bright angel.

394
00:36:12,252 --> 00:36:13,651
Romeo.

395
00:36:14,932 --> 00:36:16,570
O Romeo!

396
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:18,643
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

397
00:36:23,132 --> 00:36:25,327
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

398
00:36:25,412 --> 00:36:30,122
Or, ifthou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
and l'll no longer be a Capulet.

399
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:33,683
Shall l hear more,

400
00:36:33,772 --> 00:36:35,683
or shall l speak at this?

401
00:36:35,772 --> 00:36:38,161
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.

402
00:36:38,612 --> 00:36:41,331
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.

403
00:36:41,412 --> 00:36:43,368
What's Montague?

404
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:45,249
lt is not hand,

405
00:36:45,332 --> 00:36:47,721
nor foot, nor arm, nor face,

406
00:36:49,852 --> 00:36:52,844
nor any other part belonging to a man.

407
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:55,403
O be some other name!

408
00:36:57,692 --> 00:36:59,683
What's in a name?

409
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:04,291
That which we call a rose by
any other word would smell as sweet.

410
00:37:04,372 --> 00:37:07,489
So Romeo would,
were he not Romeo called,

411
00:37:07,572 --> 00:37:12,168
retain that dear perfection
which he owes without that title.

412
00:37:13,252 --> 00:37:15,129
Romeo, doffthy name;

413
00:37:15,212 --> 00:37:18,602
and for thy name, which is
no part ofthee, take all myself.

414
00:37:18,692 --> 00:37:20,683
l take thee at thy word.

415
00:37:30,932 --> 00:37:32,923
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?

416
00:37:33,012 --> 00:37:35,287
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.

417
00:37:35,372 --> 00:37:37,727
How camest thou hither, tell me,
and wherefore?

418
00:37:37,812 --> 00:37:39,768
The garden walls are high
and hard to climb,

419
00:37:39,852 --> 00:37:42,207
and the place death,
considering who thou art.

420
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:44,886
With love's light wings
did l o'erperch these walls,

421
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,963
for stony limits cannot hold love out,

422
00:37:47,052 --> 00:37:49,407
and what love can do,
that dares love attempt.

423
00:37:49,492 --> 00:37:52,131
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me!

424
00:38:13,812 --> 00:38:16,610
lf they do see thee, they will murder thee.

425
00:38:20,572 --> 00:38:23,882
l have night's cloak
to hide me from their eyes.

426
00:38:24,132 --> 00:38:26,123
But thou love me,

427
00:38:26,212 --> 00:38:28,203
let them find me here.

428
00:38:28,692 --> 00:38:33,288
My life were better ended by their hate
than death prorogued,

429
00:38:36,292 --> 00:38:38,283
wanting ofthy love.

430
00:39:16,052 --> 00:39:18,520
Thou knowest
the mask of night is on my face;

431
00:39:18,612 --> 00:39:20,921
else would a maiden blush
bepaint my cheek

432
00:39:21,012 --> 00:39:23,572
for that which thou hast
heard me speak tonight.

433
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,643
Fain would l dwell on form,

434
00:39:25,732 --> 00:39:27,768
fain, fain deny what l have spoke.

435
00:39:27,852 --> 00:39:30,241
But... farewell compliment.

436
00:39:31,892 --> 00:39:33,883
Dost thou love me?

437
00:39:35,492 --> 00:39:37,960
l know thou wilt say ''Ay'',
and l will take thy word.

438
00:39:38,052 --> 00:39:40,486
Yet, ifthou swear'st,
thou may'st prove false.

439
00:39:40,572 --> 00:39:43,928
O gentle Romeo, ifthou dost love,
pronounce it faithfully.

440
00:39:44,012 --> 00:39:46,401
Lady, by yonder blessed moon l vow,

441
00:39:46,492 --> 00:39:49,689
that tips with silver all these fruit tree tops...

442
00:39:49,772 --> 00:39:51,763
O swear not by the moon,

443
00:39:51,852 --> 00:39:55,561
the inconstant moon that monthly
changes in her circled orb,

444
00:39:55,652 --> 00:39:58,371
lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

445
00:39:58,452 --> 00:40:01,091
What shall l swear by?

446
00:40:01,172 --> 00:40:03,163
Do not swear at all.

447
00:40:03,252 --> 00:40:05,243
Or, ifthou wilt,

448
00:40:05,332 --> 00:40:09,120
swear by thy gracious self
which is the god of my idolatry,

449
00:40:09,212 --> 00:40:11,203
and l'll believe thee.

450
00:40:11,652 --> 00:40:13,643
lf my heart's...

451
00:40:14,172 --> 00:40:16,163
dear love...

452
00:40:25,452 --> 00:40:30,810
Do not swear. Although l joy in thee,
l have no joy in this contract tonight.

453
00:40:30,892 --> 00:40:34,202
lt is too rash, too unadvised,
too sudden, too like the lightning,

454
00:40:34,292 --> 00:40:36,852
which doth cease to be
ere one can say ''lt lightens''.

455
00:40:36,932 --> 00:40:38,331
Sweet, good night!

456
00:40:38,412 --> 00:40:41,006
This bud of love,
by summer's ripening breath,

457
00:40:41,092 --> 00:40:43,731
may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

458
00:40:43,812 --> 00:40:44,847
Good night.

459
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:47,771
Good night!

460
00:40:50,092 --> 00:40:52,048
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

461
00:40:54,092 --> 00:40:56,481
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?

462
00:40:58,492 --> 00:41:01,962
The exchange ofthy love's
faithful vow for mine.

463
00:41:05,412 --> 00:41:08,290
l gave thee mine before thou didst request it!

464
00:41:18,092 --> 00:41:19,571
Juliet!

465
00:41:27,212 --> 00:41:29,521
Three words, dear Romeo,
and good night indeed.

466
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:32,570
lf that thy bent of love be honourable,
thy purpose marriage,

467
00:41:32,652 --> 00:41:35,450
send me word tomorrow, by one
that l'll procure to come to thee,

468
00:41:35,532 --> 00:41:37,727
where and what time thou wilt
perform the rite,

469
00:41:37,812 --> 00:41:39,689
and all my fortunes at thy foot l'll lay

470
00:41:39,772 --> 00:41:41,922
and follow thee, my lord,
throughout the world.

471
00:41:42,012 --> 00:41:43,127
Julieta!

472
00:41:43,732 --> 00:41:45,768
Ay! By and by, l come!

473
00:41:45,852 --> 00:41:48,730
But ifthou meanest not well,
l do beseech thee...

474
00:41:48,812 --> 00:41:50,803
- Juliet!
- By and by, l come!

475
00:41:50,892 --> 00:41:53,565
..to cease thy strife,
and leave me to my grief.

476
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,730
Tomorrow will l send.

477
00:41:56,812 --> 00:41:58,643
So thrive my soul.

478
00:42:06,052 --> 00:42:07,929
A thousand times good night.

479
00:42:08,012 --> 00:42:11,049
A thousand times the worse,
to want thy light!

480
00:42:12,252 --> 00:42:13,401
Juliet!

481
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:16,884
Julieta!

482
00:42:21,012 --> 00:42:22,730
Good night.

483
00:42:25,052 --> 00:42:28,886
Love goes toward love
as schoolboys from their books;

484
00:42:30,212 --> 00:42:32,203
but love from love,

485
00:42:33,492 --> 00:42:35,722
toward school with heavy looks.

486
00:42:37,412 --> 00:42:38,083
Romeo!

487
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:40,769
What o'clock tomorrow
shall l send to thee?

488
00:42:41,812 --> 00:42:43,803
By the hour of nine.

489
00:42:43,892 --> 00:42:46,964
l will not fail. 'Tis twenty year till then.

490
00:42:47,412 --> 00:42:49,130
Good night.

491
00:42:56,572 --> 00:42:58,290
Good night. Good night.

492
00:43:07,412 --> 00:43:09,403
Parting is such sweet sorrow

493
00:43:09,492 --> 00:43:12,609
that l shall say good night till it be morrow.

494
00:43:14,252 --> 00:43:17,881
Juliet!

495
00:43:18,132 --> 00:43:21,807
You andme always

496
00:43:21,892 --> 00:43:24,281
And for ever

497
00:43:24,372 --> 00:43:27,808
You andme always

498
00:43:27,892 --> 00:43:30,690
And for ever

499
00:43:35,692 --> 00:43:39,048
lt was always you andme...

500
00:43:39,852 --> 00:43:44,642
Almighty is the powerful grace
that lies in plants, herbs, stones,

501
00:43:44,732 --> 00:43:46,723
and their true qualities.

502
00:43:49,852 --> 00:43:52,412
For nought so vile
that on the earth doth live

503
00:43:52,492 --> 00:43:55,052
but to the earth
some special good doth give.

504
00:43:57,412 --> 00:44:00,848
And nought so good
but strained from that fair use

505
00:44:00,932 --> 00:44:03,571
revolts from true birth,
stumbling on abuse.

506
00:44:04,492 --> 00:44:07,768
Virtue itselfturns vice, being misapplied,

507
00:44:07,852 --> 00:44:11,083
and vice sometime's by action dignified.

508
00:44:11,172 --> 00:44:15,404
Within the infant rind ofthis... weak flower...

509
00:44:15,492 --> 00:44:18,131
poison is resident...

510
00:44:18,212 --> 00:44:20,442
and medicine power.

511
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:24,411
For this, being smelt,
with that part cheers each part.

512
00:44:24,492 --> 00:44:26,050
Being tasted,

513
00:44:26,132 --> 00:44:30,284
slays all senses with the heart.

514
00:44:31,532 --> 00:44:35,605
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
in man as well as herbs,

515
00:44:35,692 --> 00:44:37,683
grace and rude will.

516
00:44:37,772 --> 00:44:42,050
And where the worser is predominant,
full soon the canker death

517
00:44:42,132 --> 00:44:43,963
eats up that plant.

518
00:44:44,052 --> 00:44:46,043
Good morrow, Father!

519
00:44:46,132 --> 00:44:47,963
Benedicite!

520
00:44:49,172 --> 00:44:52,084
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?

521
00:44:52,812 --> 00:44:54,450
Good morrow, Romeo.

522
00:44:54,532 --> 00:44:56,409
Good morrow.

523
00:44:56,492 --> 00:44:58,960
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head

524
00:44:59,052 --> 00:45:01,566
so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.

525
00:45:02,412 --> 00:45:05,131
Or if not so, then here l hit it right...

526
00:45:05,772 --> 00:45:08,570
Our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight!

527
00:45:09,452 --> 00:45:12,330
The last is true - the sweeter rest was mine.

528
00:45:12,412 --> 00:45:14,687
God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?

529
00:45:14,772 --> 00:45:16,888
Rosaline? My ghostly father, no!

530
00:45:16,972 --> 00:45:19,361
l have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

531
00:45:19,452 --> 00:45:22,171
That's my good son.
But where then hast thou been?

532
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:25,847
l have been feasting with mine enemy,
where on a sudden one hath wounded me

533
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:27,490
that's by me wounded.

534
00:45:27,572 --> 00:45:30,450
Both our remedies within thy help
and holy physic lies.

535
00:45:30,532 --> 00:45:32,966
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift.

536
00:45:33,052 --> 00:45:35,691
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

537
00:45:35,772 --> 00:45:38,605
Then plainly know
my heart's dear love is set

538
00:45:38,692 --> 00:45:41,331
on the fair daughter of rich Capulet.

539
00:45:41,892 --> 00:45:43,883
We met, we wooed,

540
00:45:44,532 --> 00:45:46,523
we made exchange of vow.

541
00:45:47,532 --> 00:45:50,683
l'll tell thee as we pass, but this l pray,

542
00:45:50,772 --> 00:45:53,411
that thou consent to marry us today.

543
00:45:55,772 --> 00:45:57,888
Holy Saint Francis!

544
00:45:57,972 --> 00:45:59,963
What a change is here!

545
00:46:00,052 --> 00:46:04,170
ls Rosaline, that thou didst love
so dear, so soon forsaken?

546
00:46:04,252 --> 00:46:08,643
Young men's love then lies not truly
in their hearts, but in their eyes.

547
00:46:09,172 --> 00:46:11,527
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

548
00:46:11,612 --> 00:46:14,410
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

549
00:46:17,612 --> 00:46:19,204
l pray thee...

550
00:46:20,172 --> 00:46:21,651
chide me not!

551
00:46:21,732 --> 00:46:25,520
Her l love now doth grace for grace
and love for love allow.

552
00:46:25,612 --> 00:46:27,603
The other did not so.

553
00:46:27,692 --> 00:46:29,683
Yes, she well knew...

554
00:46:29,772 --> 00:46:33,242
thy love did read by rote,
that could not spell.

555
00:46:36,652 --> 00:46:42,682
Maybe l'm just like my mother

556
00:46:42,772 --> 00:46:47,402
She's never satisfied

557
00:46:47,492 --> 00:46:51,644
For this alliance mayso happyprove

558
00:46:51,732 --> 00:46:55,122
to turn yourhouseholds'rancour

559
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:56,964
to pure love.

560
00:46:57,052 --> 00:46:59,646
This is what it sounds like

561
00:46:59,732 --> 00:47:03,930
When doves cry

562
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:08,404
Come, young waverer, come, go with me.

563
00:47:08,652 --> 00:47:11,291
ln one respect l'll thy assistant be.

564
00:47:12,852 --> 00:47:15,525
For this alliance may so happy prove

565
00:47:15,612 --> 00:47:18,365
to turn your households' rancour
to pure love.

566
00:47:18,452 --> 00:47:20,408
O let us hence! l stand on sudden haste!

567
00:47:23,572 --> 00:47:26,723
Wisely and slow. They stumble that run fast.

568
00:47:27,812 --> 00:47:31,088
Maybe l'm just too demanding

569
00:47:31,172 --> 00:47:34,881
Maybe l'm just like my father, too bold

570
00:47:34,972 --> 00:47:38,442
Maybe l'mjustlike mymother

571
00:47:38,532 --> 00:47:42,491
She's neversatisfiied

572
00:47:42,572 --> 00:47:44,449
Why do we scream at each other?

573
00:47:57,092 --> 00:47:59,083
This is whatitsounds like

574
00:48:00,812 --> 00:48:02,803
This is whatitsounds like

575
00:48:04,052 --> 00:48:06,122
This is whatitsounds like

576
00:48:06,212 --> 00:48:09,727
Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Came he not home tonight?

577
00:48:09,812 --> 00:48:12,690
Not to his father's; l spoke with his man.

578
00:48:12,772 --> 00:48:16,447
Why, that same pale hard-hearted
wench, that Rosaline,

579
00:48:16,532 --> 00:48:19,046
torments him so, that he will sure run mad.

580
00:48:19,132 --> 00:48:21,851
Tybalt hath sent a letter to his father's house.

581
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:24,685
- A challenge, on my life!
- Romeo will answer it?

582
00:48:24,772 --> 00:48:26,888
Any man that can write may answer a letter.

583
00:48:26,972 --> 00:48:30,248
Nay, he will answer the letter's master,
how he dares being dared.

584
00:48:30,332 --> 00:48:35,531
Well, alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead!
Stabbed with a white wench's black eye!

585
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:37,568
Run through the ear with a love-song!

586
00:48:37,652 --> 00:48:40,803
The very pin of his heart cleft
with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft!

587
00:48:40,892 --> 00:48:43,122
And is he a man to encounter Tybalt?

588
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:46,443
- Why, what is Tybalt?
- More than Prince of Cats.

589
00:48:47,012 --> 00:48:50,448
He is the courageous captain of compliments!

590
00:48:51,292 --> 00:48:53,965
He fights as you sing pricksong.

591
00:48:54,972 --> 00:48:57,770
Keeps time, distance, and proportion.

592
00:48:58,292 --> 00:49:00,408
He rests his minim rests.

593
00:49:00,492 --> 00:49:03,723
One, two, and a third...

594
00:49:03,812 --> 00:49:04,767
in your bosom.

595
00:49:04,852 --> 00:49:07,241
The very butcher of a silk button.

596
00:49:07,692 --> 00:49:09,171
A duellist.

597
00:49:09,252 --> 00:49:12,608
A duellist! A gentleman
of the very first house,

598
00:49:12,692 --> 00:49:14,683
of the first and second cause.

599
00:49:14,772 --> 00:49:16,763
The immortal passado!

600
00:49:18,252 --> 00:49:20,243
The punto reverso!

601
00:49:20,732 --> 00:49:21,960
The, um... hai!

602
00:49:22,052 --> 00:49:23,770
The what?

603
00:49:24,732 --> 00:49:26,723
Here comes Romeo.

604
00:49:27,652 --> 00:49:28,846
Romeo!

605
00:49:31,692 --> 00:49:33,683
Ho-ho, taffeta punk!

606
00:49:33,772 --> 00:49:35,763
Signor Romeo, bonjour!

607
00:49:36,532 --> 00:49:39,444
There's a French salutation
to your French slop.

608
00:49:39,532 --> 00:49:41,887
You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.

609
00:49:41,972 --> 00:49:44,770
Good morrow to you both.
What counterfeit did l give you?

610
00:49:44,852 --> 00:49:47,207
The slip, sir, the slip.
Can you not conceive?

611
00:49:47,292 --> 00:49:49,681
Pardon, good Mercutio.
My business was great

612
00:49:49,772 --> 00:49:52,161
and in such a case as mine
a man may strain courtesy.

613
00:49:52,252 --> 00:49:53,446
That's as much as to say,

614
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:57,241
such a case as yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams!

615
00:49:57,332 --> 00:50:00,529
- Meaning to curtsy?
- Thou hast most kindly hit it.

616
00:50:00,612 --> 00:50:04,048
- A most courteous exposition.
- Nay, l am the very pink of courtesy.

617
00:50:04,132 --> 00:50:06,168
- Pink for flower?
- Right.

618
00:50:06,252 --> 00:50:08,641
Why, then is my pump well flowered!

619
00:50:08,732 --> 00:50:10,324
O sure wit!

620
00:50:10,412 --> 00:50:13,609
Now art thou sociable. Now art thou Romeo!

621
00:50:13,692 --> 00:50:17,002
Now art thou what thou art,
by art as well as by nature!

622
00:50:18,252 --> 00:50:20,243
Here's goodly gear!

623
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:23,768
God ye good e'en, fair gentlewoman.

624
00:50:23,852 --> 00:50:26,241
l desire some confidence with you.

625
00:50:29,372 --> 00:50:30,361
A bawd!

626
00:50:30,892 --> 00:50:33,087
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd!

627
00:50:33,172 --> 00:50:35,402
So ho! So ho!

628
00:50:35,492 --> 00:50:37,130
So ho! So ho!

629
00:50:37,412 --> 00:50:39,289
Romeo!

630
00:50:39,372 --> 00:50:41,169
Romeo!

631
00:50:42,052 --> 00:50:43,246
Romeo!

632
00:50:46,092 --> 00:50:48,083
Will you come to your father's?

633
00:50:48,932 --> 00:50:50,923
We'll to dinner thither.

634
00:50:51,012 --> 00:50:52,730
l will follow you.

635
00:50:54,932 --> 00:50:57,605
Farewell, ancient lady! Farewell!

636
00:50:59,612 --> 00:51:03,161
lf ye should lead her
in a fool's paradise, as they say,

637
00:51:03,252 --> 00:51:06,767
it were a very gross kind
of behaviour, as they say.

638
00:51:06,852 --> 00:51:08,843
For the lady is young

639
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:12,561
and, therefore, ifyou should
deal double with her,

640
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:17,009
truly it were an ill thing,
and very weak dealing.

641
00:51:18,092 --> 00:51:20,925
Bid her to come to confession
this afternoon

642
00:51:21,012 --> 00:51:25,767
and there she shall,
at Friar Laurence's cell, be shrived...

643
00:51:26,652 --> 00:51:28,404
and married.

644
00:51:30,252 --> 00:51:32,129
Love me, love me

645
00:51:32,212 --> 00:51:34,203
Say thatyou love me

646
00:51:34,292 --> 00:51:36,522
Fool me, foolme

647
00:51:36,772 --> 00:51:38,091
Go on andfoolme

648
00:51:38,172 --> 00:51:40,083
Love me, love me

649
00:51:40,172 --> 00:51:42,242
Pretend thatyou love me

650
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:44,323
O honey nurse! What news?

651
00:51:45,052 --> 00:51:48,203
- Nurse!
- l am aweary! Give me leave awhile!

652
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:50,563
Fie, how my bones ache!

653
00:51:51,132 --> 00:51:53,123
What ajaunce have l!

654
00:51:53,492 --> 00:51:55,642
Would thou hadst my bones
and l thy news.

655
00:51:55,732 --> 00:51:57,643
Come, l pray thee, speak!

656
00:51:57,732 --> 00:52:01,441
Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?

657
00:52:01,532 --> 00:52:03,966
Can you not see that l am out of breath?

658
00:52:04,052 --> 00:52:06,361
How art thou out of breath
when thou hast breath

659
00:52:06,452 --> 00:52:08,329
to say to me that thou art out of breath?

660
00:52:09,212 --> 00:52:11,931
ls the news good or bad? Answer to that.

661
00:52:12,012 --> 00:52:15,527
Well, you have made a simple choice.

662
00:52:15,612 --> 00:52:18,080
You know not how to choose a man.

663
00:52:18,172 --> 00:52:21,209
Romeo? No, not he.

664
00:52:21,292 --> 00:52:24,409
Though his face be better than any man's,

665
00:52:24,492 --> 00:52:26,960
yet his leg excels all men's,

666
00:52:27,052 --> 00:52:29,566
and for a hand and a foot and a body...

667
00:52:33,372 --> 00:52:36,603
But all this l did know before.
What says he of our marriage?

668
00:52:36,692 --> 00:52:37,681
What ofthat?

669
00:52:37,772 --> 00:52:40,844
Lord, how my head aches!
What a head have l!

670
00:52:41,292 --> 00:52:43,886
And my back!

671
00:52:44,652 --> 00:52:46,608
T'other side!

672
00:52:47,012 --> 00:52:48,604
Oh, my back!

673
00:52:48,692 --> 00:52:51,570
ln faith, l am sorry that thou art not well.

674
00:52:51,652 --> 00:52:54,041
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse!

675
00:52:54,132 --> 00:52:56,327
Tell me, what says my love?

676
00:52:56,412 --> 00:52:58,926
Thy love says, like an honest gentleman,

677
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:01,731
and a courteous, and a kind,
and a handsome,

678
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:03,723
and, l warrant, a virtuous...

679
00:53:03,812 --> 00:53:06,121
- Where is your mother?
- ''Where is your mother?''

680
00:53:06,212 --> 00:53:08,123
How oddly thou repliest!

681
00:53:08,212 --> 00:53:11,045
Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
''Where is your mother?''

682
00:53:11,132 --> 00:53:14,886
God's Lady dear! Are you so hot?
Henceforth, do your messages yourself!

683
00:53:14,972 --> 00:53:18,282
O here's such a coil!
Come, what says Romeo?

684
00:53:23,572 --> 00:53:26,325
Have you got leave
to go to confession today?

685
00:53:28,449 --> 00:53:29,518
l have.

686
00:53:30,729 --> 00:53:34,085
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell.

687
00:53:34,609 --> 00:53:37,885
There stays a husband to make you a wife!

688
00:53:40,609 --> 00:53:48,482
Everybody's free to feel good

689
00:53:49,649 --> 00:53:53,642
To feel good

690
00:53:55,729 --> 00:53:57,879
Brother and sister

691
00:53:57,969 --> 00:54:02,087
Together we'll make it through

692
00:54:03,289 --> 00:54:05,484
Oh-oh, yeah

693
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:12,728
Someday a spirit will take you
and guide you there

694
00:54:15,689 --> 00:54:18,522
l know you've been hurting

695
00:54:18,609 --> 00:54:23,558
But l've been waiting to be there for you

696
00:54:25,649 --> 00:54:30,006
And l'll be there just helping you out

697
00:54:30,089 --> 00:54:35,209
Whenever l can

698
00:54:35,289 --> 00:54:37,325
Everybody's free

699
00:54:37,409 --> 00:54:40,446
Everybody's free

700
00:54:40,529 --> 00:54:43,805
Oh, yeah

701
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:46,764
These violent delights

702
00:54:46,849 --> 00:54:49,044
have violent ends.

703
00:54:49,129 --> 00:54:52,485
And in their triumph die
like fire and powder

704
00:54:52,569 --> 00:54:55,129
which, as they kiss, consume.

705
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:59,600
The sweetest honey is loathsome
in his own deliciousness.

706
00:54:59,689 --> 00:55:03,238
Therefore love moderately.

707
00:55:03,329 --> 00:55:06,639
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter,
for us both.

708
00:55:07,769 --> 00:55:10,522
Oh, to feelgood

709
00:55:18,569 --> 00:55:21,606
l pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire!

710
00:55:21,689 --> 00:55:24,567
The day is hot, the Capels are abroad,

711
00:55:28,009 --> 00:55:30,921
and ifwe meet we shall not 'scape a brawl,

712
00:55:31,009 --> 00:55:34,638
for now, these hot days,
is the mad blood stirring.

713
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:37,244
We're the Caps!

714
00:55:40,569 --> 00:55:43,129
See? Thou art like one ofthese fellows...

715
00:55:43,209 --> 00:55:46,201
that, when he enters
the confines of a tavern,

716
00:55:46,289 --> 00:55:48,928
claps me his Sword upon the table

717
00:55:49,009 --> 00:55:51,159
and says, ''God send me no need ofthee''.

718
00:55:51,249 --> 00:55:54,207
And, by the operation ofthe second cup,

719
00:55:54,289 --> 00:55:58,043
draws him on the drawer,
when indeed there is no need.

720
00:55:58,129 --> 00:56:00,006
Yeah!

721
00:56:00,689 --> 00:56:02,361
Am l like such a fellow?

722
00:56:02,449 --> 00:56:06,158
Thou art as hot ajack in thy mood
as any in Verona.

723
00:56:09,689 --> 00:56:11,680
By my head, here come the Capulets.

724
00:56:13,129 --> 00:56:15,768
By my heel... l care not.

725
00:56:17,689 --> 00:56:19,680
Follow me close.

726
00:56:33,369 --> 00:56:36,600
Gentlemen, good day.
A word with one ofyou?

727
00:56:39,689 --> 00:56:41,680
And but one word with one of us?

728
00:56:41,769 --> 00:56:43,760
Couple it with something.

729
00:56:44,769 --> 00:56:46,361
Make it a word and a...

730
00:56:46,449 --> 00:56:47,279
a blow!

731
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:53,485
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir,

732
00:56:53,569 --> 00:56:55,605
and you will give me occasion.

733
00:56:55,689 --> 00:56:58,328
Could you not take some occasion
without giving?

734
00:56:59,769 --> 00:57:00,963
Mercutio!

735
00:57:01,049 --> 00:57:03,882
Thou, uh... consortest with Romeo?

736
00:57:06,609 --> 00:57:08,122
Consort!

737
00:57:09,889 --> 00:57:11,925
What, dost thou make us minstrels?

738
00:57:12,009 --> 00:57:14,967
And thou make minstrels of us,
look to hear nothing but discords!

739
00:57:15,329 --> 00:57:16,921
Here's my fiddlestick!

740
00:57:17,009 --> 00:57:19,921
Here's that shall make you dance!
Zounds! Consort!

741
00:57:20,009 --> 00:57:23,604
Either withdraw unto some private place,
or reason coldly ofyour grievances,

742
00:57:23,689 --> 00:57:25,839
or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us!

743
00:57:25,929 --> 00:57:27,840
Men's eyes were made to look,
and let them gaze.

744
00:57:27,929 --> 00:57:30,568
l will not budge for no man's pleasure, l.

745
00:57:33,929 --> 00:57:36,762
Peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.

746
00:57:38,369 --> 00:57:39,768
Mercutio!

747
00:57:42,249 --> 00:57:43,443
Romeo!

748
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:54,120
The love l bear thee can afford
no better term than this.

749
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:56,601
Thou art a villain!

750
00:58:38,809 --> 00:58:40,800
Tybalt,

751
00:58:42,369 --> 00:58:45,167
the reason that l have to love thee...

752
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:47,600
doth much excuse

753
00:58:47,689 --> 00:58:50,647
the appertaining rage to such a greeting.

754
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:55,124
Villain am l none.

755
00:58:58,249 --> 00:59:01,161
Therefore, farewell.

756
00:59:01,249 --> 00:59:03,126
l see thou knowest me not.

757
00:59:11,729 --> 00:59:14,846
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
that thou hast done me!

758
00:59:15,529 --> 00:59:17,440
Turn and draw!

759
00:59:18,369 --> 00:59:19,358
Turn and draw!

760
00:59:20,729 --> 00:59:21,844
Turn and draw.

761
00:59:21,929 --> 00:59:25,444
- Turn and draw!
- l do protest l never injured thee,

762
00:59:26,689 --> 00:59:29,442
but love thee better than thou canst devise

763
00:59:29,529 --> 00:59:32,965
till thou shalt know the reason of my love.

764
00:59:33,049 --> 00:59:35,279
And so, good Capulet,

765
00:59:35,369 --> 00:59:38,281
whose name l tender
as dearly as mine own...

766
00:59:42,529 --> 00:59:44,326
be satisfied.

767
00:59:47,009 --> 00:59:49,000
Be satisfied.

768
00:59:50,009 --> 00:59:54,082
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!

769
01:00:04,209 --> 01:00:06,200
Thou art my soul's hate!

770
01:00:14,689 --> 01:00:15,360
Tybalt!

771
01:00:16,209 --> 01:00:17,722
You rat-catcher!

772
01:00:17,809 --> 01:00:19,288
Will you walk?

773
01:00:20,009 --> 01:00:21,806
What wouldst thou have with me?

774
01:00:21,889 --> 01:00:24,642
Good King of Cats,
nothing but one ofyour nine lives!

775
01:00:24,729 --> 01:00:26,003
l am for you!

776
01:00:39,889 --> 01:00:42,961
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio!

777
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:10,324
- Art thou hurt?
- Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch.

778
01:01:12,849 --> 01:01:14,726
A scratch!

779
01:01:15,969 --> 01:01:16,799
Ay, a scratch...

780
01:01:17,729 --> 01:01:19,162
A scratch!

781
01:01:23,169 --> 01:01:26,161
Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.

782
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:27,967
'Twill serve.

783
01:01:28,049 --> 01:01:31,724
Ask for me tomorrow
and you shall find me a grave man.

784
01:01:47,889 --> 01:01:51,438
A plague... o' both your houses!

785
01:01:56,929 --> 01:01:59,443
They have made worms' meat of me.

786
01:01:59,529 --> 01:02:03,283
A plague on both your houses!

787
01:02:03,369 --> 01:02:04,802
Your houses! Your houses!

788
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:07,039
Your houses! Your houses!

789
01:02:18,689 --> 01:02:20,486
No!

790
01:02:42,369 --> 01:02:45,406
Why the devil came you between us?

791
01:02:45,489 --> 01:02:47,798
l was hurt under your arm.

792
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,925
l thought all for the best!

793
01:02:51,329 --> 01:02:55,083
A plague o' both your houses.

794
01:02:57,329 --> 01:03:00,560
No! No!

795
01:03:03,289 --> 01:03:05,325
Come forth!

796
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:08,967
Come forth!

797
01:03:09,049 --> 01:03:11,040
Mercutio!

798
01:03:14,529 --> 01:03:19,557
Requiem aeternam

799
01:03:20,609 --> 01:03:25,763
Requiem aeternam

800
01:03:27,449 --> 01:03:39,202
Dona eis

801
01:03:43,249 --> 01:03:45,046
No!

802
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:24,724
Come, gentle night.

803
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:29,083
Come, loving, black-browed night.
Give me my Romeo.

804
01:04:29,329 --> 01:04:33,880
And when l shall die, take him
and cut him out in little stars

805
01:04:33,969 --> 01:04:37,279
and he will make
the face of heaven so fine

806
01:04:37,369 --> 01:04:40,884
that all the world
will be in love with night

807
01:04:40,969 --> 01:04:43,688
and pay no worship to the garish sun.

808
01:04:44,449 --> 01:04:47,759
O, l have bought the mansion of a love

809
01:04:47,849 --> 01:04:50,044
but not possessed it;

810
01:04:50,129 --> 01:04:52,768
and though l am sold, not yet enjoyed.

811
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:56,804
So... tedious is this day...

812
01:04:56,889 --> 01:05:00,325
as is the night before some festival
to an impatient child

813
01:05:00,409 --> 01:05:03,367
that hath new robes and may not wear them.

814
01:05:49,569 --> 01:05:52,925
Mercutio's soul is but a little way
above our heads,

815
01:05:53,009 --> 01:05:55,000
staying for thine to keep him company!

816
01:05:55,089 --> 01:05:57,967
Thou wretched boy shalt with him hence!

817
01:05:58,729 --> 01:06:00,720
Either thou, or l,

818
01:06:00,809 --> 01:06:03,118
or both, must go with him!

819
01:06:03,809 --> 01:06:07,165
Either thou, or l, or both, must go with him!

820
01:06:07,249 --> 01:06:08,682
Either thou,

821
01:06:08,769 --> 01:06:12,682
or l, or both, must go with him!

822
01:07:08,769 --> 01:07:13,160
l am fortune's fool!

823
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:23,278
Romeo!

824
01:07:25,129 --> 01:07:27,404
Away, be gone! Stand not amazed!

825
01:07:33,609 --> 01:07:35,167
Away!

826
01:07:35,249 --> 01:07:37,240
Romeo!

827
01:07:50,169 --> 01:07:52,160
Tybalt!

828
01:07:57,129 --> 01:08:00,121
Where are the vile beginners ofthis fray?

829
01:08:03,209 --> 01:08:05,928
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

830
01:08:08,129 --> 01:08:11,485
Romeo he cries aloud, ''Hold, friends!''

831
01:08:12,729 --> 01:08:15,448
Tybalt hit the life of stout Mercutio.

832
01:08:15,929 --> 01:08:17,920
Tybalt here slain...

833
01:08:18,809 --> 01:08:20,800
Romeo's hand did slay.

834
01:08:20,889 --> 01:08:21,639
Prince!

835
01:08:23,009 --> 01:08:24,601
As thou art true,

836
01:08:24,689 --> 01:08:27,408
for blood of ours, shed blood of Montague!

837
01:08:27,489 --> 01:08:30,128
Romeo... spoke him fair,

838
01:08:30,209 --> 01:08:32,769
could not take truce
with the unruly spleen of Tybalt...

839
01:08:32,849 --> 01:08:34,168
deaf to peace.

840
01:08:34,249 --> 01:08:36,763
He is a kinsman to the Montague.
Affection makes him false!

841
01:08:37,849 --> 01:08:40,727
l beg forjustice,
which thou, Prince, must give!

842
01:08:41,729 --> 01:08:43,481
Romeo slew Tybalt.

843
01:08:43,569 --> 01:08:45,161
Romeo must not live!

844
01:08:47,409 --> 01:08:50,003
Romeo slew him. He slew Mercutio.

845
01:08:50,089 --> 01:08:52,842
Who now the price
of his dear blood doth owe?

846
01:08:56,529 --> 01:08:59,248
Not Romeo, Prince.
He was Mercutio's friend.

847
01:08:59,329 --> 01:09:02,366
His fault concludes but what the law
should end - the life of Tybalt.

848
01:09:02,449 --> 01:09:04,883
And for that offence
immediately we do exile him.

849
01:09:04,969 --> 01:09:05,958
Noble Prince...

850
01:09:06,049 --> 01:09:08,199
l will be deafto pleading and excuses!

851
01:09:08,289 --> 01:09:10,962
Nor tears nor prayers
shall purchase out abuses!

852
01:09:11,049 --> 01:09:12,607
Therefore use none!

853
01:09:15,969 --> 01:09:18,927
Let Romeo hence in haste!

854
01:09:19,009 --> 01:09:24,879
Else, when he is found, that hour is his last!

855
01:09:24,969 --> 01:09:28,006
Romeo is banished!

856
01:09:29,249 --> 01:09:31,240
Banishment...

857
01:09:32,849 --> 01:09:34,840
Be merciful, say death.

858
01:09:35,369 --> 01:09:39,282
For exile hath more terror in his look,
much more than death.

859
01:09:39,929 --> 01:09:42,124
Do not say banishment.

860
01:09:42,609 --> 01:09:47,763
Affliction is enamoured ofthy parts,
and thou art wedded to calamity.

861
01:09:47,849 --> 01:09:50,158
Hence from Verona art thou banished.

862
01:09:50,249 --> 01:09:53,559
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

863
01:09:53,649 --> 01:09:55,799
There is no world without Verona walls.

864
01:09:55,889 --> 01:10:00,121
Hence banished is banish'd from
the world, and world's exile is death.

865
01:10:00,209 --> 01:10:01,881
Then banished is death mistermed.

866
01:10:01,969 --> 01:10:04,961
Calling death banished, thou cutt'st
my head offwith a golden axe

867
01:10:05,049 --> 01:10:07,040
and smil'st upon the stroke
that murders me.

868
01:10:07,129 --> 01:10:10,087
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!

869
01:10:10,169 --> 01:10:12,922
This is dear mercy and thou seest it not.

870
01:10:14,969 --> 01:10:16,368
Hence!

871
01:10:23,529 --> 01:10:25,997
- l come from my lady Juliet!
- Welcome, then.

872
01:10:26,089 --> 01:10:27,568
Where is my lady's lord?

873
01:10:27,649 --> 01:10:29,640
Romeo, come forth.

874
01:10:30,569 --> 01:10:32,560
- Ah, sir.
- Nurse.

875
01:10:33,129 --> 01:10:34,926
Ah, sir.

876
01:10:35,009 --> 01:10:37,000
Death's the end of all.

877
01:10:38,129 --> 01:10:40,120
Speakest thou ofJuliet?

878
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,605
Where is she and how doth she?

879
01:10:42,689 --> 01:10:45,726
And what says my concealed lady
to our cancelled love?

880
01:10:45,809 --> 01:10:49,085
O she says nothing, sir,
but weeps and weeps.

881
01:10:49,169 --> 01:10:52,764
And then on Romeo cries,
and then falls down again.

882
01:10:55,289 --> 01:10:58,804
As ifthat name, shot from
the deadly level of a gun,

883
01:10:58,889 --> 01:11:04,088
did murder her, as that name's
cursed hand murdered her kinsman!

884
01:11:04,529 --> 01:11:06,918
l thought thy disposition better tempered.

885
01:11:07,009 --> 01:11:09,807
Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy.

886
01:11:10,489 --> 01:11:13,367
Tybalt would kill thee,
but thou slewest Tybalt.

887
01:11:13,449 --> 01:11:15,440
There art thou happy.

888
01:11:15,969 --> 01:11:20,679
The law that threatened death
becomes thy friend and turns it to exile.

889
01:11:20,769 --> 01:11:22,725
There art thou happy.

890
01:11:22,809 --> 01:11:25,403
A pack of blessings light upon thy back.

891
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:29,004
Wherefore railest thou on thy birth,
the heaven, and earth,

892
01:11:29,089 --> 01:11:33,082
since birth, and heaven, and earth,
all three do meet in thee at once?

893
01:11:33,169 --> 01:11:35,080
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.

894
01:11:37,129 --> 01:11:39,438
How well my comfort is revived by this.

895
01:11:39,889 --> 01:11:40,878
Go.

896
01:11:41,889 --> 01:11:44,198
Get thee to thy love, as was decreed.

897
01:11:44,289 --> 01:11:47,361
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.

898
01:11:48,249 --> 01:11:50,046
Hie you! Make haste!

899
01:11:51,009 --> 01:11:53,443
But look thou...
stay not till the watch be set,

900
01:11:53,529 --> 01:11:55,645
for then thou canst not pass to Mantua,

901
01:11:55,729 --> 01:11:59,438
where thou wilt live till we can
find a time to blaze your marriage,

902
01:11:59,529 --> 01:12:02,327
reconcile your friends,
beg pardon ofthe Prince,

903
01:12:02,409 --> 01:12:06,038
and call thee back with
twenty hundred thousand times more joy

904
01:12:06,129 --> 01:12:08,518
than thou went'st forth in lamentation.

905
01:12:11,849 --> 01:12:14,682
Quick, hence! Be gone by break of day!

906
01:12:15,129 --> 01:12:16,767
Sojourn in Mantua!

907
01:12:17,169 --> 01:12:18,648
Farewell.

908
01:12:25,809 --> 01:12:27,367
O God!

909
01:12:27,449 --> 01:12:30,168
Did Romeo's handshed Tybalt's blood?

910
01:12:30,769 --> 01:12:34,603
O serpentheart, hid with a flowering face!

911
01:12:36,049 --> 01:12:40,247
Was everbook containing
such vile matterso fairlybound?

912
01:12:40,729 --> 01:12:44,563
O that deceitshould dwell
in such a gorgeous palace!

913
01:12:48,769 --> 01:12:50,885
She'll not come down tonight.

914
01:12:52,649 --> 01:12:55,368
These times ofwoe afford no time to woo.

915
01:12:55,449 --> 01:12:58,885
Look you, she loved
her kinsman Tybalt dearly.

916
01:12:58,969 --> 01:13:00,960
And so did l.

917
01:13:01,049 --> 01:13:02,641
Well,

918
01:13:03,729 --> 01:13:05,720
we were born to die.

919
01:13:06,129 --> 01:13:10,919
l'll know her mind early tomorrow.
Tonight she's mewed up to her heaviness.

920
01:13:20,209 --> 01:13:23,167
Shall lspeak ill ofhim thatis myhusband?

921
01:13:23,249 --> 01:13:26,719
Ah, poormylord, what tongue
shall smooth thyname,

922
01:13:26,809 --> 01:13:30,438
when l, thy three-hours' wife,
have mangledit?

923
01:13:30,529 --> 01:13:33,999
But whyfore, villain,
didst thou killmy cousin?

924
01:13:56,169 --> 01:14:05,282
l'm kissingyou

925
01:14:36,569 --> 01:14:49,562
Cos l'm kissingyou, o-oh

926
01:14:51,209 --> 01:15:04,088
l'm kissingyou

927
01:15:10,209 --> 01:15:13,167
l will make a desperate tender
of my child's love.

928
01:15:13,249 --> 01:15:16,366
l think she will be ruled in all respects by me.

929
01:15:16,449 --> 01:15:20,078
Nay, more! l doubt it not!

930
01:15:20,169 --> 01:15:22,239
But what say you to Thursday?

931
01:15:22,329 --> 01:15:24,320
My lord, l...

932
01:15:24,969 --> 01:15:27,403
l would that Thursday were tomorrow!

933
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:30,128
Thursday let it be, then! Wife!

934
01:15:30,209 --> 01:15:32,200
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed.

935
01:15:32,289 --> 01:15:35,918
Tell her o' Thursday she shall
be married to this noble sir!

936
01:16:47,249 --> 01:16:50,047
Wilt thou be gone? lt is not yet near day.

937
01:16:50,969 --> 01:16:53,688
l must be gone and live, or stay and die.

938
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:56,928
Yon light is not daylight; l know it, l.

939
01:16:57,009 --> 01:17:02,037
lt is some meteor that the sun exhales
to light thee on thy way to Mantua.

940
01:17:02,129 --> 01:17:05,360
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not be gone.

941
01:17:05,729 --> 01:17:07,720
Well, let me be taken.

942
01:17:07,809 --> 01:17:09,527
Let me be put to death!

943
01:17:09,889 --> 01:17:12,278
l have more care to stay than will to go.

944
01:17:12,369 --> 01:17:15,406
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.

945
01:17:17,649 --> 01:17:20,925
How is't, my soul? Let's talk. lt is not day.

946
01:17:24,049 --> 01:17:26,244
lt is... lt is!

947
01:17:26,849 --> 01:17:29,238
Hie hence, be gone, away!

948
01:17:29,809 --> 01:17:31,879
O now be gone!
More light and light it grows.

949
01:17:32,729 --> 01:17:34,720
More light and light,

950
01:17:34,809 --> 01:17:36,925
more dark and dark our woes.

951
01:17:39,369 --> 01:17:40,768
Madam!

952
01:17:43,129 --> 01:17:45,359
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber!

953
01:17:45,449 --> 01:17:47,724
Ho, daughter, are you up?

954
01:17:53,569 --> 01:17:54,922
Then, window,

955
01:17:55,009 --> 01:17:57,000
let day in and let life...

956
01:17:57,769 --> 01:17:58,758
out!

957
01:17:58,849 --> 01:17:59,964
Juliet?

958
01:18:00,049 --> 01:18:03,200
- Think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
- l doubt it not.

959
01:18:06,489 --> 01:18:10,482
Trust me, love. All these woes
shall serve for sweet discourses

960
01:18:10,569 --> 01:18:12,878
- in our times to come.
- Ho, daughter!

961
01:18:16,809 --> 01:18:17,798
Juliet!

962
01:18:28,449 --> 01:18:30,121
O God!

963
01:18:30,209 --> 01:18:32,404
l have an ill-divining soul!

964
01:18:32,489 --> 01:18:34,878
Methinks l see thee, now thou art so low,

965
01:18:34,969 --> 01:18:36,925
as one dead in the bottom of a tomb.

966
01:18:38,849 --> 01:18:41,317
Adieu!

967
01:18:41,849 --> 01:18:43,521
O fortune, fortune!

968
01:18:43,609 --> 01:18:45,406
Be fiickle, fortune.

969
01:18:45,489 --> 01:18:49,368
For then lhope thou wiltnot
keep him long, butsendhim back.

970
01:18:59,769 --> 01:19:01,885
Thou hast a careful father, child.

971
01:19:01,969 --> 01:19:05,041
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,

972
01:19:05,129 --> 01:19:08,201
hath sorted out a sudden day ofjoy,

973
01:19:08,769 --> 01:19:12,284
which thou expect'st not,
nor l looked not for.

974
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:15,558
Madam, in happy time. What day is that?

975
01:19:15,649 --> 01:19:18,686
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,

976
01:19:18,769 --> 01:19:21,806
the gallant, young,
and noble gentleman, Sir Paris,

977
01:19:21,889 --> 01:19:25,120
at St Peter's Church,
shall happily make thee there

978
01:19:25,209 --> 01:19:26,403
a joyful bride.

979
01:19:31,649 --> 01:19:34,527
Now, by St Peter's Church and Peter too,

980
01:19:34,609 --> 01:19:37,521
he shall not make me there ajoyful bride!

981
01:19:38,569 --> 01:19:40,924
Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself.

982
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:42,886
How now, wife?

983
01:19:42,969 --> 01:19:45,403
Have you delivered to her our decree?

984
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:46,808
Ay, sir.

985
01:19:46,889 --> 01:19:49,198
But she will none, she gives you thanks.

986
01:19:50,169 --> 01:19:53,161
l would the fool were married to her grave.

987
01:19:56,449 --> 01:19:57,848
How?

988
01:19:57,929 --> 01:19:59,920
Will she none?

989
01:20:00,009 --> 01:20:02,000
ls she not proud?

990
01:20:02,369 --> 01:20:05,679
Doth she not count her blest,
unworthy as she is,

991
01:20:05,769 --> 01:20:09,000
that we have wrought so worthy
a gentleman to be her bride?

992
01:20:09,489 --> 01:20:12,686
Not proud you have,
but thankful that you have.

993
01:20:12,769 --> 01:20:15,522
Proud can l never be ofwhat l hate!

994
01:20:15,609 --> 01:20:18,487
Thank me no thankings,
nor proud me no prouds!

995
01:20:18,569 --> 01:20:21,845
But fettle your fine joints
'gainst Thursday next!

996
01:20:21,929 --> 01:20:23,885
Hear me with patience but to speak a word!

997
01:20:23,969 --> 01:20:24,879
No!

998
01:20:24,969 --> 01:20:25,958
Fie, fie! Stop it!

999
01:20:26,049 --> 01:20:28,688
Speak not! Reply not! Do not answer me!

1000
01:20:28,769 --> 01:20:30,407
Husband, are you mad?

1001
01:20:32,809 --> 01:20:36,006
Hang thee, young baggage!
Disobedient wretch!

1002
01:20:36,089 --> 01:20:39,126
God in heaven bless her! You are
to blame, my lord, to rate her so!

1003
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:41,086
Peace, you mumbling fool!

1004
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:42,921
l tell thee what.

1005
01:20:43,009 --> 01:20:45,204
Get thee to church o' Thursday,

1006
01:20:45,289 --> 01:20:47,598
or never after look me in the face!

1007
01:20:47,689 --> 01:20:50,362
An you be mine, l'll give you to my friend.

1008
01:20:50,449 --> 01:20:53,407
An you be not, hang, beg, starve,

1009
01:20:53,489 --> 01:20:55,400
die in the streets!

1010
01:20:55,489 --> 01:20:57,161
Trust to 't. Bethink you.

1011
01:20:57,249 --> 01:20:59,240
l'll not be forsworn!

1012
01:21:10,329 --> 01:21:14,607
O sweet my mother, cast me not away!

1013
01:21:15,809 --> 01:21:18,642
Delay this marriage for a month, a week.

1014
01:21:18,729 --> 01:21:20,287
Or, ifyou do not,

1015
01:21:20,369 --> 01:21:23,600
make the bridal bed in that
dim monument where Tybalt lies.

1016
01:21:25,609 --> 01:21:27,361
Talk not to me...

1017
01:21:29,329 --> 01:21:31,320
for l'll not speak a word.

1018
01:21:32,129 --> 01:21:35,007
Do as thou wilt,
for l have done with thee.

1019
01:21:45,769 --> 01:21:47,361
O God!

1020
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:50,088
O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?

1021
01:21:51,929 --> 01:21:56,241
What say'st thou? Hast thou not
a word ofjoy? Some comfort, Nurse!

1022
01:21:57,089 --> 01:21:59,080
Faith, here it is.

1023
01:22:00,169 --> 01:22:03,923
l think it best you marry with this Paris.

1024
01:22:05,289 --> 01:22:07,280
O he's a lovely gentleman.

1025
01:22:10,809 --> 01:22:14,040
l think you are happy in this second match,

1026
01:22:14,929 --> 01:22:16,920
for it excels your first.

1027
01:22:17,969 --> 01:22:19,960
Or, if it did not,

1028
01:22:20,049 --> 01:22:22,244
your first is dead.

1029
01:22:27,209 --> 01:22:29,200
Or 'twere as good he were

1030
01:22:29,289 --> 01:22:32,008
as living here and you no use to him.

1031
01:22:35,649 --> 01:22:37,765
Speakest thou from thy heart?

1032
01:22:39,049 --> 01:22:42,405
And from my soul too;
else beshrew them both!

1033
01:22:44,369 --> 01:22:45,961
Amen.

1034
01:22:46,049 --> 01:22:47,641
What?

1035
01:22:50,729 --> 01:22:53,641
Well, thou hast comforted me
marvellous much.

1036
01:22:54,769 --> 01:22:59,285
Go in and tell my lady l am gone,
having displeased my father,

1037
01:22:59,369 --> 01:23:03,362
to Friar Laurence to make
confession and be absolved.

1038
01:23:08,569 --> 01:23:11,641
lmmoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death.

1039
01:23:11,729 --> 01:23:14,402
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous

1040
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:17,287
that she doth give her sorrow
so much sway

1041
01:23:17,369 --> 01:23:22,523
and in his wisdom hastes our marriage
to stop the inundation of her tears.

1042
01:23:25,569 --> 01:23:28,447
Happily met, my lady and my wife.

1043
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:31,359
That may be, sir, when l may be a wife.

1044
01:23:31,449 --> 01:23:34,122
That ''may be'' must be, love,
on Thursday next.

1045
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:37,997
- What must be shall be.
- Well, that's a certain text.

1046
01:23:39,009 --> 01:23:41,045
Come you to make confession?

1047
01:23:41,129 --> 01:23:45,202
Are you at leisure, holy Father, now,
or shall l come to you at evening mass?

1048
01:23:45,289 --> 01:23:48,679
My leisure serves thee,
pensive daughter, now.

1049
01:23:48,769 --> 01:23:51,647
Good sir, we must entreat the time alone.

1050
01:23:52,129 --> 01:23:54,848
God shield l should disturb devotion!

1051
01:23:58,489 --> 01:24:02,528
Juliet, on Thursday early will l rouse ye.

1052
01:24:03,569 --> 01:24:05,525
Till then adieu,

1053
01:24:05,609 --> 01:24:07,600
and keep this holy kiss.

1054
01:24:15,849 --> 01:24:17,805
Tell me not, Father,
that thou hearest ofthis,

1055
01:24:17,889 --> 01:24:21,598
- unless thou tell me how l may prevent it!
- lt strains me past the compass of my wits!

1056
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:23,600
lf in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,

1057
01:24:23,689 --> 01:24:25,441
do thou but call my resolution wise.

1058
01:24:25,529 --> 01:24:28,168
- And with this, l'll help it presently!
- Hold, daughter!

1059
01:24:28,249 --> 01:24:31,446
Be not so long to speak! l long to die!

1060
01:24:32,569 --> 01:24:35,129
l do spy a kind of hope,

1061
01:24:35,209 --> 01:24:37,325
which craves as desperate an execution

1062
01:24:37,409 --> 01:24:39,604
as that is desperate
which we would prevent.

1063
01:24:39,689 --> 01:24:41,884
lf, rather than to marry with this Paris,

1064
01:24:41,969 --> 01:24:44,608
thou hast the strength ofwill
to slay thyself,

1065
01:24:44,689 --> 01:24:48,364
then it is likely thou wilt
undertake a thing like death

1066
01:24:48,449 --> 01:24:51,247
to chide away this shame.

1067
01:24:52,049 --> 01:24:54,040
And, ifthou darest,

1068
01:24:54,969 --> 01:24:56,960
l'll give thee remedy.

1069
01:24:58,569 --> 01:25:02,278
No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest.

1070
01:25:02,369 --> 01:25:04,929
Each part,
deprived of supple government,

1071
01:25:05,009 --> 01:25:08,001
shall stiff and stark and cold
appear, like death.

1072
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:12,567
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning
comes to rouse thee from thy bed,

1073
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:14,640
there art thou dead.

1074
01:25:14,729 --> 01:25:16,685
Thou shalt be borne
to that same ancient vault

1075
01:25:16,769 --> 01:25:18,566
where all the kindred ofthe Capulets lie.

1076
01:25:18,649 --> 01:25:21,243
And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death

1077
01:25:21,329 --> 01:25:23,797
thou shalt continue
four and twenty hours

1078
01:25:23,889 --> 01:25:26,403
and then awake as from a pleasant sleep.

1079
01:25:26,489 --> 01:25:29,083
ln the meantime, against thou shalt awake,

1080
01:25:29,169 --> 01:25:31,603
shall Romeo by my letters know our drift.

1081
01:25:31,689 --> 01:25:36,479
And hither shall he come that very night
to bear thee both hence to Mantua.

1082
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:39,358
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,

1083
01:25:39,449 --> 01:25:41,963
and this distilling liquor drink thou off.

1084
01:25:42,049 --> 01:25:46,281
l'll send my letters to thy lord
post haste to Mantua.

1085
01:25:58,289 --> 01:25:59,608
Hello?

1086
01:26:21,769 --> 01:26:24,078
What ifthis mixture do not work at all?

1087
01:26:24,169 --> 01:26:27,161
Shall l be married then tomorrow morning?

1088
01:26:30,609 --> 01:26:33,681
- What, are you busy? Need you my help?
- No, madam.

1089
01:26:33,769 --> 01:26:37,125
We have culled such necessaries
as are behoveful for our estate tomorrow.

1090
01:26:37,209 --> 01:26:40,838
So please you, let me now be left alone,
and let the nurse this night sit up with you.

1091
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:43,045
For l am sure you have your hands full all

1092
01:26:43,129 --> 01:26:44,767
in this so sudden business.

1093
01:26:44,849 --> 01:26:46,328
Good night.

1094
01:26:46,409 --> 01:26:48,400
Get thee to bed and rest,

1095
01:26:49,369 --> 01:26:51,519
for thou hast need.

1096
01:26:57,729 --> 01:26:59,082
Farewell.

1097
01:27:02,049 --> 01:27:04,517
God knows when we shall meet again.

1098
01:27:07,049 --> 01:27:08,368
Good night.

1099
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:23,360
Romeo,

1100
01:27:23,449 --> 01:27:25,519
l drink to thee.

1101
01:27:42,289 --> 01:27:49,525
Requiem...

1102
01:27:54,889 --> 01:27:58,723
As the custom is, in all her best array,
bear her to church.

1103
01:28:53,689 --> 01:28:56,567
And all this dayan unaccustomedspirit

1104
01:28:56,649 --> 01:29:00,324
lifts me above the ground
with cheerful thoughts.

1105
01:29:00,409 --> 01:29:02,843
l dreamtmylady came
and foundme dead

1106
01:29:02,929 --> 01:29:06,717
and breathedsuch life with kisses
in mylips thatlrevived

1107
01:29:06,809 --> 01:29:08,800
and was an emperor.

1108
01:29:09,849 --> 01:29:11,840
Ah, me!

1109
01:29:11,929 --> 01:29:14,397
How sweetis love itselfpossessed,

1110
01:29:14,489 --> 01:29:17,640
when butlove's shadows
are so rich injoy!

1111
01:29:34,649 --> 01:29:36,241
News from Verona!

1112
01:29:44,489 --> 01:29:45,683
How now, Balthasar?

1113
01:29:45,769 --> 01:29:48,602
Dost thou not bring me
letters from the priest?

1114
01:29:48,689 --> 01:29:51,157
How doth my lady? ls my father well?

1115
01:29:52,329 --> 01:29:55,924
How doth my lady Juliet?
For nothing can be ill if she be well.

1116
01:29:58,689 --> 01:30:01,283
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.

1117
01:30:08,809 --> 01:30:10,800
Her body rests in chapel monument,

1118
01:30:10,889 --> 01:30:14,006
and her immortal part
with the angels lives.

1119
01:30:14,729 --> 01:30:16,720
l saw her laid low.

1120
01:30:17,689 --> 01:30:20,203
Pardon me for bringing these ill news.

1121
01:30:25,969 --> 01:30:27,960
ls it e'en so?

1122
01:30:50,769 --> 01:30:53,363
Then l defy you, stars!

1123
01:31:06,129 --> 01:31:07,721
Juliet!

1124
01:31:09,129 --> 01:31:11,199
Juliet!

1125
01:31:43,729 --> 01:31:47,119
- l will hence tonight.
- Have patience!

1126
01:31:50,969 --> 01:31:52,448
Leave me!

1127
01:31:52,529 --> 01:31:55,327
Your looks are pale and wild
and do import some misadventure.

1128
01:31:55,409 --> 01:31:57,206
Tush! Thou art deceived!

1129
01:31:58,209 --> 01:32:01,201
Hast thou no letters to me from the priest?

1130
01:32:12,289 --> 01:32:14,280
No matter.

1131
01:32:18,129 --> 01:32:20,120
Well, Juliet,

1132
01:32:21,529 --> 01:32:23,724
l will lie with thee tonight.

1133
01:32:27,769 --> 01:32:29,760
l will hence tonight.

1134
01:33:06,409 --> 01:33:09,845
Romeo is within Verona walls.

1135
01:33:18,569 --> 01:33:19,968
Fear comes upon me!

1136
01:33:20,449 --> 01:33:22,405
O, much l fear

1137
01:33:22,489 --> 01:33:25,925
some ill, unthrifty thing!

1138
01:33:28,449 --> 01:33:30,121
The letter was of dear import!

1139
01:33:31,249 --> 01:33:33,638
l couldn't send it,
nor get a messenger to bring it thee.

1140
01:33:34,889 --> 01:33:36,766
The neglecting it may do much damage.

1141
01:33:36,849 --> 01:33:39,204
Bring forth these enemies,
Capulet and Montague!

1142
01:33:52,009 --> 01:33:53,408
Let me have a dram of poison,

1143
01:33:53,489 --> 01:33:57,641
such soon-speeding gear as will
disperse itselfthrough all the veins

1144
01:33:57,729 --> 01:33:59,765
that the life-weary taker may fall dead.

1145
01:33:59,849 --> 01:34:04,001
Such mortal drugs l have, but Verona law
is death to any he that utters them.

1146
01:34:04,089 --> 01:34:07,081
The world is not thy friend,
nor the world's law!

1147
01:34:07,169 --> 01:34:09,125
Then be not poor, but break it

1148
01:34:09,209 --> 01:34:11,006
and take this!

1149
01:34:12,649 --> 01:34:15,209
My poverty but not my will consents.

1150
01:34:15,809 --> 01:34:18,721
l pay thy poverty and not thy will.

1151
01:34:29,529 --> 01:34:31,759
Drink it off,

1152
01:34:31,849 --> 01:34:35,683
and ifyou had the strength of 20 men,
it would dispatch you straight.

1153
01:34:35,769 --> 01:34:37,361
There's my gold.

1154
01:34:40,409 --> 01:34:42,400
Worse poison to men's souls

1155
01:34:42,489 --> 01:34:46,038
than these poor compounds
that thou may'st not sell.

1156
01:35:08,889 --> 01:35:11,767
Romeo hath no notice ofthese accidents.

1157
01:35:12,409 --> 01:35:14,445
l will write again to Mantua.

1158
01:35:19,649 --> 01:35:22,288
Within the hour will the fair Juliet wake.

1159
01:35:22,369 --> 01:35:24,360
She stirs. The lady stirs.

1160
01:35:33,009 --> 01:35:36,479
- l do beseech you.
- Live and be prosperous.

1161
01:35:37,449 --> 01:35:39,440
And farewell, good fellow.

1162
01:35:40,089 --> 01:35:41,568
Then l will leave thee.

1163
01:36:18,609 --> 01:36:20,406
Tempt not a desperate man!

1164
01:36:27,409 --> 01:36:28,842
Hold! Hold!

1165
01:36:31,089 --> 01:36:32,078
Hold!

1166
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:40,484
Once more l say to you, hold!

1167
01:39:39,049 --> 01:39:41,040
My love...

1168
01:39:42,089 --> 01:39:44,080
My wife...

1169
01:39:44,689 --> 01:39:47,442
Death that hath sucked
the honey ofthy breath

1170
01:39:47,529 --> 01:39:50,202
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

1171
01:39:52,889 --> 01:39:54,880
Thou art not conquered.

1172
01:39:58,969 --> 01:40:03,804
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson
in thy lips and in thy cheeks

1173
01:40:04,369 --> 01:40:07,600
and death's pale flag is not advanced there.

1174
01:40:19,529 --> 01:40:23,602
Dear Juliet, why art thou yet so fair?

1175
01:40:26,129 --> 01:40:29,804
Shall l believe that
unsubstantial death is amorous

1176
01:40:29,889 --> 01:40:33,086
and keeps thee here in dark
to be his paramour?

1177
01:41:10,409 --> 01:41:11,762
Here.

1178
01:41:11,849 --> 01:41:14,921
O, here will l set up my everlasting rest

1179
01:41:16,729 --> 01:41:22,201
and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this world-wearied flesh.

1180
01:41:29,689 --> 01:41:31,680
Eyes, look your last.

1181
01:41:34,369 --> 01:41:36,485
Arms, take your last embrace.

1182
01:41:44,129 --> 01:41:45,721
And lips...

1183
01:41:46,809 --> 01:41:48,925
O you, the doors to breath,...

1184
01:41:52,609 --> 01:41:54,839
seal with a righteous kiss...

1185
01:42:16,089 --> 01:42:18,080
a dateless bargain

1186
01:42:18,609 --> 01:42:20,565
to engrossing death.

1187
01:42:25,409 --> 01:42:26,762
Romeo...

1188
01:42:38,369 --> 01:42:39,927
What's here?

1189
01:42:43,449 --> 01:42:44,598
Poison...

1190
01:42:46,329 --> 01:42:49,605
Drunk all, and left no friendly drop
to help me after?

1191
01:42:54,409 --> 01:42:56,400
l'll kiss thy lips.

1192
01:42:56,489 --> 01:42:59,083
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them.

1193
01:43:03,889 --> 01:43:05,880
Thy lips are warm.

1194
01:43:21,129 --> 01:43:22,721
Thus...

1195
01:43:23,889 --> 01:43:25,880
with a kiss...

1196
01:43:29,769 --> 01:43:31,760
l die.

1197
01:47:24,529 --> 01:47:27,680
See what a scourge
is laid upon your hate,

1198
01:47:27,769 --> 01:47:31,284
that heaven finds means
to kill yourjoys with love!

1199
01:47:32,089 --> 01:47:36,560
And l, for winking at your discords too,
have lost a brace of kinsmen.

1200
01:47:40,449 --> 01:47:42,440
All are punished.

1201
01:47:49,569 --> 01:47:53,198
All are punished!

1202
01:47:56,769 --> 01:48:00,398
A gloomingpeace
this morning with itbrings.

1203
01:48:00,489 --> 01:48:03,447
The sun forsorrow
will notshowhis head.

1204
01:48:03,529 --> 01:48:06,839
Go hence, to have more talk
of these sad things.

1205
01:48:07,569 --> 01:48:10,766
Some shallbe pardoned,
and some punished.

1206
01:48:11,369 --> 01:48:18,047
For never was a story ofmore woe
than this ofJulietandherRomeo.

1207
01:49:02,209 --> 01:49:04,769
Wake

1208
01:49:04,929 --> 01:49:06,920
From yoursleep

1209
01:49:09,529 --> 01:49:13,044
The drying of

1210
01:49:13,129 --> 01:49:15,768
Your tears

1211
01:49:17,169 --> 01:49:18,966
Today

1212
01:49:20,329 --> 01:49:22,126
We escape

1213
01:49:23,889 --> 01:49:28,565
We escape

1214
01:49:32,409 --> 01:49:34,400
Pack

1215
01:49:35,329 --> 01:49:37,479
And get dressed

1216
01:49:39,889 --> 01:49:43,438
Before yourfather

1217
01:49:43,929 --> 01:49:46,318
Hears us

1218
01:49:47,129 --> 01:49:48,926
Before

1219
01:49:50,449 --> 01:49:52,246
All hell

1220
01:49:54,849 --> 01:49:58,728
Breaks loose

1221
01:50:02,289 --> 01:50:07,079
Breathe

1222
01:50:07,969 --> 01:50:09,960
Keep breathing

1223
01:50:11,729 --> 01:50:15,563
Don't lose

1224
01:50:16,649 --> 01:50:19,038
Your nerve

1225
01:50:25,009 --> 01:50:29,799
Breathe

1226
01:50:30,609 --> 01:50:32,600
Keep breathing

1227
01:50:34,529 --> 01:50:37,521
l can't do this

1228
01:50:39,449 --> 01:50:42,168
Alone

1229
01:50:51,649 --> 01:50:57,201
Sing us a song

1230
01:50:59,049 --> 01:51:06,205
A song to keep us warm

1231
01:51:07,209 --> 01:51:09,006
There's

1232
01:51:09,769 --> 01:51:12,124
Such a chill

1233
01:51:13,729 --> 01:51:18,280
Such a chill

1234
01:51:22,489 --> 01:51:27,438
You can laugh

1235
01:51:29,689 --> 01:51:35,127
A spineless laugh

1236
01:51:37,249 --> 01:51:39,160
We hope

1237
01:51:39,289 --> 01:51:42,804
Your rules

1238
01:51:42,969 --> 01:51:48,646
And wisdom

1239
01:51:48,729 --> 01:51:52,324
Choke you

1240
01:51:52,409 --> 01:51:55,082
Now

1241
01:51:55,209 --> 01:51:58,804
We are one

1242
01:51:59,729 --> 01:52:06,840
ln everlastingpeace

1243
01:52:07,089 --> 01:52:08,647
We hope

1244
01:52:10,369 --> 01:52:12,360
That you choke

1245
01:52:13,809 --> 01:52:18,519
That you choke

1246
01:52:21,689 --> 01:52:23,486
We hope

1247
01:52:25,089 --> 01:52:26,886
That you choke

1248
01:52:28,769 --> 01:52:33,126
That you choke

1249
01:52:36,849 --> 01:52:38,646
We hope

1250
01:52:40,129 --> 01:52:42,120
That you choke

1251
01:52:43,489 --> 01:52:48,688
That you choke

1252
