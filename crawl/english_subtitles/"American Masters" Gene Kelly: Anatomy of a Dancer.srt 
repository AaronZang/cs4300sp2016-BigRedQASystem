3
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:45,344
Mom! Mom!

4
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:50,247
The dirt burned my hands!

5
00:00:58,157 --> 00:01:01,524
What's HazMat doing here?

6
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,223
Kid's playing tag, takes a header in the dirt,

7
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:06,299
ends up with first-degree
burns on his hands.

8
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,529
Wait. We got a call
about a dead body.

9
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,196
Yeah, I'm getting there.
So, HazMat arrives,

10
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,535
figuring some sort
of chemical spill.

11
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,741
Starts removing
the toxic soil and, bam,

12
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:19,078
a shovel slams
into a shoulder blade.

13
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:23,538
Clothing's been
reduced to shreds.

14
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,552
Epidermal tissue
is virtually gone.

15
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,554
The body's desiccate d.

16
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,791
Viscous fluid the consistency
of dishwashing soap.

17
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,326
HazMat guy was right.

18
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,428
Killer doused
the body in lye.

19
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,130
Must have thought
it would destroy the body.

20
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,700
Yeah, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust...

21
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,969
without the wait.

22
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:24,076
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I need
to neutralize the soil.

23
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:25,600
If you touch the soil,

24
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,613
you're going to contaminate my crime

25
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,248
but I'll let you know when I'm finished.

26
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,148
Okay.

27
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,756
What did you get?

28
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,592
Vic's wallet...
what's left of it.

29
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,527
It's a Nevada license.
Bob Martin.

30
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:43,262
31. He lived downtown.

31
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:45,331
There's 20 bucks in the flap.

32
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,821
Rules out robbery.

33
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:02,682
Look at this.

34
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:08,287
Looks like a paint fleck...
or metal chip, maybe.

35
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:10,653
What did the ranger say?

36
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,459
Nobody saw anything suspicious.

37
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,860
Park closes up at 10:00 p.m.

38
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,696
No security,
minimal lighting.

39
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,498
Basically, a pretty good place
to dump a body.

40
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:21,634
You found this guy
in the park?

41
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,269
Actually,
HazMat found him.

42
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,906
Well, that explains the
postmortem scar tissue.

43
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,308
Lye had a field day on his flesh.

44
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:34,880
(sizzling)

45
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,382
Time of death?

46
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,680
Approximately 24 hours ago.

47
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,819
Tell me about the car.

48
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,488
Car? What car?

49
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,256
Comminuted fractures

50
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:48,127
of the proximal
third tib - fib, both legs.

51
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,995
Bumper hits right
below the knees.

52
00:03:49,995 --> 00:03:52,691
Sure sign he was hit by a car.

53
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:56,168
Look at all the bruising.

54
00:03:56,168 --> 00:03:59,438
If he was struck and killed,
ecchymosis would be nonexistent.

55
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,274
Which suggests
he survived the impact.

56
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:03,175
Usual injuries:

57
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:06,011
Ruptured patellar tendon,

58
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:07,546
laceration of the saphenous vein,

59
00:04:07,546 --> 00:04:11,482
and multiple incised wounds
containing slivers of glass,

60
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:15,488
which I will send over to Trace.

61
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:19,425
And bruises: Legs, arms and chest.

62
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,428
What I didn't find was arterial lacerations

63
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,063
or underlying vessel damage.

64
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,198
Confirms death wasn't immediate?

65
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:26,766
Correct.

66
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,368
Victim was like
a leaky water balloon...

67
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:32,404
heart slowly pumped blood
right out of his body.

68
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:35,474
And, based on the coloration
of the bruises,

69
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:36,709
trauma was sustained

70
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:40,270
approximately 48 hours
before death.

71
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:44,016
Three days ago,
this man was injured.

72
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:46,418
He bled out
until he died yesterday.

73
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:49,216
We didn't find any blood.

74
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,028
Lockwood?

75
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:57,396
Hey, Stokes.

76
00:04:57,396 --> 00:04:59,431
Who called it in?

77
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:00,762
BLM chopper pilot.

78
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,768
They always buzz Diablo Canyon

79
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,471
looking for hikers in distress... or worse.

80
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,806
He see anyone else in the vicinity?

81
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,975
No, just the vic:
Stacy Warner, 26.

82
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:11,310
Las Vegas resident.

83
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,612
I scanned
for a Missing Persons on her.

84
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:15,603
Nothing.

85
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,253
No tire treads.

86
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:22,354
Whose are these?

87
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:24,788
Paramedics and mine.

88
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,486
Same path. Walked
straight in, straight out.

89
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:32,520
Engagement ring,
no wedding band.

90
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,244
Orbital bone
looks fractured.

91
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,180
Could have lost her footing,
hit her head.

92
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,415
Could have.

93
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:52,248
Hold that for me?

94
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:10,369
Down feather.

95
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:13,634
But she's not wearing a jacket.

96
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,939
Shine that right here.

97
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:36,128
Grissom should enjoy this.

98
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:37,429
Hey, Lockwood,

99
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:39,164
you got any food
in your vehicle?

100
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:41,033
Hamburger? Anything like that?

101
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,735
Gum, sugar-free.

102
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,904
No. Gum will kill him.

103
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,306
I'll stop at the
first place I see

104
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:48,908
pick up some jerky.

105
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,912
Will you get me a sample
of the ground

106
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,470
underneath the body?

107
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,915
Soon as the coroner moves her.

108
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,008
Good.

109
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:04,590
Bob is dead?

110
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,592
His body was found at Sunset Park.

111
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,890
His license gave this address.

112
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,030
Are you his domestic partner?

113
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,131
We're roommates.

114
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,699
I got divorced
last year.

115
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,896
And, about six months ago,
Bob's wife kicked him out.

116
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,604
He needed a place
to crash

117
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,606
and I needed help
with the mortgage.

118
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,608
He's two months late on the rent.

119
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,941
How do I go about collecting under the

120
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:32,718
Look, we were roommates. We weren't

121
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,687
When was the last time you saw him?

122
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:35,915
We both work at the Tangiers.

123
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,990
He managed the restaurant, and I work in

124
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,591
Last Monday,
we drove in together.

125
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:41,560
But you didn't drive home
together?

126
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,294
Mondays? No.

127
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:45,831
After shift, he'd walk over
to the university.

128
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:47,633
He's an amateur photographer.

129
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,930
Take the bus home.

130
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,936
But he didn't come home
Monday night.

131
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,631
I didn't think much of it.

132
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:54,707
He's always going
back and forth
with Charlotte.

133
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,108
His wife.

134
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,376
What do I care?

135
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,470
As long as the rent's paid.

136
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:11,654
Photo Department
kept a log.

137
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,952
Bob Martin reserved a darkroom on

138
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,654
from 10:00 to 11:00 p.m.

139
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:16,996
He was logged in
Monday night.

140
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,598
Good. We got a bus to catch.

141
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:22,123
(horn blaring)

142
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,971
He left these photos behind. They're all
of the same woman.

143
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,977
I bet it's his wife.

144
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:53,866
Silver flecks...

145
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,528
like the one you found
at the body.

146
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:03,542
I got a piece of plastic.

147
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:07,000
Looks like a headlight cover,
maybe.

148
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:10,871
This could be our crime scene.

149
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:14,887
(tires screech)

150
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,015
Assuming this was a hit-and-run,

151
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,355
how does a guy
with two broken legs end up

152
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:24,021
on the other side of town buried
in a park, covered in lye?

153
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,793
What are you looking for?

154
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,037
No sign of blood.

155
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,732
No evidence of a cleanup.

156
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:35,637
If this is our crime scene,

157
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,577
then somewhere between here and Sunset

158
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:41,137
Bob Martin lost
eight to ten pints of blood.

159
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,346
Where is it?

160
00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:49,288
So want to tell me about
the silver flecks I found?

161
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:49,988
Paint chips?

162
00:09:49,988 --> 00:09:52,047
Aluminum and melamine in the color coat

163
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,760
indicate that it's car paint.

164
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,057
Factory job.

165
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,792
Uh... body shop paint contains styrene, not

166
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,768
Hmm. What type of car?

167
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,066
Trick question. Paint won't tell me that.

168
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,072
But I do have an answer.

169
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,370
It's not technically part
of my job description

170
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:11,068
but, as you know,
I'm always eager

171
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,778
to expand my responsibilities.

172
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,110
Take a look down the scope.

173
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:19,118
Looks like some sort of insignia.

174
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,285
Crosshairs.

175
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:23,522
That's the plastic you collected at the

176
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:29,128
Now, that mark is only found on the S-class

177
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,096
It's all about branding.

178
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,758
Now, knowing that the headlight came from

179
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,801
I was able to compare the infrared spectra

180
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,100
with the paint spectra supplied by the

181
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,106
Check this out.

182
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,099
Your vehicle was painted Sarasota Silver.

183
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,547
Also, only available on
the S-series '99 models.

184
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,883
I checked with
the Mercedes state rep.

185
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,818
Five were sold in Nevada.

186
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,820
Sara's tracking down the owners.

187
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,824
You've, uh... already shared
this information with Sara?

188
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,121
Yeah, an hour ago.

189
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,961
And she was way more fascinated than you

190
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:05,030
Well, I'm somewhat fascinated by the fact

191
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,123
that I'm your boss, but you talked to her first.

192
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,134
Well, you were at dinner.

193
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:12,137
I've been in the lab
all day, Greg.

194
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,843
I've been
looking for you.

195
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,140
Well, it's hard
to see me

196
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,146
if you and Greg
are out ahead of me.

197
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,314
Oh, uh...
sorry about that

198
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:25,147
Brass got me a list
of those Mercedes owners.

199
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,153
One moved to Los Angeles,
three are over 50.

200
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,155
My guess, they would have
stopped and rendered aid.

201
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:34,148
Brass is checking them out. Which leaves
a Ben Weston, 25.

202
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,162
Leased the vehicle
last week.

203
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:39,198
You found my car?

204
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,532
Why? Is your car missing?

205
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:43,202
Yeah. Isn't that why
you guys are here?

206
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,605
I filed a police report
a couple days ago.

207
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,207
God, I love that car.

208
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,198
Hocked my future on it.

209
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,169
Tell me it hasn't been strip ped.

210
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,280
You wouldn't happen to have a copy of that
police

211
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,883
I'm a lawyer.

212
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,475
Here you go.

213
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,954
Thanks.

214
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:06,091
Sarasota Silver, S-series,
stolen Monday night.

215
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:08,293
Yeah. I stopped
for take out after work.

216
00:12:08,293 --> 00:12:09,361
When I came out, it was gone.

217
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:13,599
Don't most of these luxury vehicles have

218
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,767
What's with all the questions?

219
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:17,903
We're investigating
a possible hit-and-run.

220
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:22,203
You think the bastard
that stole my car hit someone?

221
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:26,545
Ignacias High,
Nevada State University...

222
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:27,479
Are you a local?

223
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:29,348
Yeah. Great town.

224
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,578
I studied my ass off in law school.

225
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,884
Passed the bar first time.

226
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:33,885
Good for you.

227
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:35,216
Let me guess...

228
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,255
criminal defense?

229
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,223
Everyone deserves
representation.

230
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:38,590
Yes, they do.

231
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:42,219
Would you happen
to remember what clothes you were

232
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,229
A blue pinstripe,
a light blue oxford,

233
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,231
gray tie... gift from my girlfriend.

234
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,767
First week as an associate. Firm like this...

235
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,928
you tend to pay attention
to wardrobe.

236
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,639
Mr. Weston, we'd like to take a look

237
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,274
Really?

238
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,243
Well, you need a warrant.

239
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,212
But I'm a nice guy.

240
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,244
I picked them up
at lunch.

241
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,518
Downstairs...
one-hour dry cleaning.

242
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:08,553
Nice suit.

243
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:09,655
Thank you.

244
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,520
I just bought it.

245
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,261
I hope you didn't
just buy the shirt.

246
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:18,252
Oh, come on.

247
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,265
I've been meaning
to change dry cleaners.

248
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,236
Well, maybe you shouldn't
have gotten lye on it. Lye is an alkali.

249
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,871
And, when it's mixed with water,

250
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,272
it eats right through fabric.

251
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:29,263
Mr. Weston...

252
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,276
you mind taking off your shirt?

253
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,277
Excuse me?

254
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,512
Lye can burn through fabric.

255
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,314
It can also burn through skin.

256
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,315
I have my limits.

257
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,284
You want me to strip, you're going to need

258
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,420
But, since there's no basis for your request,

259
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,184
you can forget about it.

260
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,194
She drowned.

261
00:13:49,194 --> 00:13:51,992
This is the girl I found
in the desert, man.

262
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,294
I am aware of that. She drowned

263
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,994
It's not possible, Dave -o.

264
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:59,003
She was found in Diablo Canyon... miles
from the nearest

265
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:01,006
Lake Mead's got to be 20 miles away.

266
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,998
Desert, no desert... I don't care. She

267
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:06,411
Look, if it's any consolation, she dry-drown

268
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:07,045
Dry-drowned?

269
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:10,310
Happens in about
ten percent of all cases.

270
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:14,286
When dry-drowning occurs,
the larynx closes involuntarily,

271
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:17,723
preventing air and water
from entering the lungs,

272
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,315
resulting in hypoxia...

273
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,027
a reduced concentration
of oxygen in the blood.

274
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,262
Thus, water's
kept out of the lungs...

275
00:14:24,262 --> 00:14:24,930
dry -drowning.

276
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,232
In wet drowning,
hypoxia also occurs,

277
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:30,369
but the larynx relaxes
and water floods the lungs.

278
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,872
Still, the question remains,
how does a girl drown

279
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:36,274
in the middle
of the desert?

280
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:37,571
She doesn't.

281
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,479
She was engaged.

282
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,714
The guy never filed a missing persons on

283
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:46,318
I didn't file a missing persons
report on Stacy

284
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,953
because she wasn't missing.

285
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,955
As far as I knew,
she was on a solo trek

286
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,491
up in Diablo working toward her NESTFs.

287
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,493
NESTFs?

288
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:55,093
Sorry.

289
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:57,596
National
Extreme Sports Trainer Finals.

290
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,798
I took mine last week. Did it in three days

291
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:03,935
So, I didn't expect her back
for at least two more days.

292
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,003
Okay.

293
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:07,539
You mind if I have
a look around?

294
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,841
No. Go ahead.

295
00:15:09,841 --> 00:15:11,433
Thanks.

296
00:15:57,956 --> 00:16:00,823
Detective.

297
00:16:10,368 --> 00:16:12,003
Check that out.

298
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:13,605
You see that?

299
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,073
Yeah.

300
00:16:15,073 --> 00:16:15,807
Mr. Hudson?

301
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:19,678
You own this house with
Stacy Warner. Is that right?

302
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:20,846
That's right.

303
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,781
Any idea
how this blood got there?

304
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:27,152
No.

305
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,450
Stacy had a head trauma wound.

306
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,157
You wouldn't know anything about that

307
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,625
I'd never hurt Stacy.

308
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,226
No?

309
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,457
How do you explain
the domestic disturbance call

310
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,464
to this address two weeks ago?

311
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,600
We told the officers then
it was nothing.

312
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,834
I don't know.

313
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:44,803
The neighbor who
filed the complaint

314
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,305
said you were really yelling
at Stacy.

315
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:48,573
Said it sounded abusive.

316
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:50,075
We're sports trainers.

317
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,544
We say some crazy things
to get each other

318
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:56,281
to do one more lap in the pool
or one more crunch.

319
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,215
Are you a liar?!

320
00:16:57,215 --> 00:17:00,018
Or are you going
to give me more?!

321
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:02,587
Are you weak?
Are you worthless?!

322
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:05,190
Can you account for your
whereabouts this week?

323
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,758
Big Sky Triathlon
in Montana.

324
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:11,396
You want to see a picture
of me crossing the finish line?

325
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:13,431
No. No.

326
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:16,423
We got what we need.

327
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,038
So I sent out some bulletins.

328
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:22,607
Got a hit on Weston's
missing Mercedes.

329
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:23,909
Sullivan called it in.

330
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,443
He's a typical tow guy.

331
00:17:25,443 --> 00:17:26,933
I'll run him.

332
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:30,048
Yeah, I got a call.

333
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:33,285
"You want a wrecked S-class?"

334
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,386
(chuckles)

335
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,186
You betcha.

336
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:38,519
The parts alone are worth
four, five times

337
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,525
the Blue Book value
of the car.

338
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,460
I asked, "Where
do I pick it up?" That's all I asked.

339
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,628
You didn't ask his name?

340
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:47,232
Someone throws you
300 thou in used parts,

341
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,234
the only response
is, "Thank you very much."

342
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,869
So where is the vehicle now?

343
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,671
Look around.

344
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,739
You work fast.

345
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:57,537
Hey, I called it in. What moredo you want?

346
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:01,535
Aristotle said something about the whole

347
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,542
Of course, he never worked in a chop shop.

348
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,552
We want all of the parts.

349
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,533
Affirmative for blood...
passenger side.

350
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:28,899
Well, that's just
a trace amount.

351
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,567
Where's the rest of it?

352
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,668
Want to pass me the luminol?

353
00:18:53,231 --> 00:18:56,401
Well, you do know
how to light up a room.

354
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,070
Location of the blood
on the seats and the dash

355
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,272
indicates
that the victim

356
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:02,637
was inside the vehicle.

357
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:05,602
Maybe the driver hit Bob Martin,

358
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,879
stopped,
and put him in the front seat.

359
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:08,913
Okay.

360
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:10,915
Where did they go?

361
00:19:10,915 --> 00:19:13,251
Well, not to the emergency room.

362
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:15,617
Not to Sunset Park
for48 hours.

363
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,622
I'll swab
the rest
of the car...

364
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,325
bring the samples
to Greg and have him run it against Bob

365
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:24,162
If you find any blood
that isn't his, then...

366
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:27,966
Maybe it belongs
to an injured joyrider,

367
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:31,026
and we have a new suspect.

368
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,450
The one day I'm due in court,

369
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,253
and you pull a drowning
in the desert.

370
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,154
How'd it go?

371
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:49,988
Oh, it went great.

372
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:53,591
The judge recessed right before my

373
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:58,255
I'm on call. Catherine's on call.

374
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,029
Boy, you're making progress.

375
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:04,661
The blood from the poolside matches the

376
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,372
Yeah. The problem is the small amount of

377
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,707
isn't enough to prove anything,
you know?

378
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,409
People bump their heads and scrape their

379
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:12,077
Yeah.

380
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,612
That musclehead
boyfriend...

381
00:20:14,612 --> 00:20:16,375
he's a little shady.

382
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:18,116
He's hiding something.
I can feel it.

383
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:18,983
Are you going to prove

384
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:22,680
that he drowned her
in their swimming pool?

385
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,689
Four samples:
One from their swimming pool,

386
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,291
one from their bathroom,
one from Lake Mead

387
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,384
and one from Clark County
Reservoir,

388
00:20:28,426 --> 00:20:31,062
but none are consistent
with the water I recovered from her

389
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:32,689
What else did you collect
from the scene?

390
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,966
Some rocks from under her body

391
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:37,068
and a goose feather.

392
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:38,403
A goose feather?

393
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,139
This looks like basalt rock.

394
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,408
Didn't it say somewhere in here

395
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,211
that you found her
at 1,500 feet?

396
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,579
The desert, yeah.

397
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,447
Well, you can only find
this rock

398
00:20:49,447 --> 00:20:51,916
at high altitudes...
like 4,000 feet.

399
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,218
Really?

400
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:54,219
Yeah.

401
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:54,853
You sure?

402
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:58,556
Yeah. I went on this field trip
up at Table Mountain

403
00:20:58,556 --> 00:21:01,159
in my senior year...
"Rocks for Jocks."

404
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,862
Don't ask me why
I remember any of this.

405
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:04,562
Hey, that helps.

406
00:21:04,562 --> 00:21:06,865
I think I'm going
to head out there.

407
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:07,632
You want to roll?

408
00:21:07,632 --> 00:21:09,801
You're on call at court,
right.

409
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,837
All that blood belonged
to the victim.

410
00:21:12,837 --> 00:21:13,605
Look at this.

411
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,608
Visible blood drops
under the passenger seat.

412
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,544
That's a strange place
for blood.

413
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,013
Radiated spatter.

414
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:22,914
What do you think?

415
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,083
Blood pooled
onto the floor mat.

416
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,551
As more drops splashed down

417
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:29,487
the impact projected
the blood drops upward.

418
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:30,088
Okay.

419
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,390
But where
did it fall from?

420
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,793
So, Greg said you guys
are processing an S-class.

421
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,795
Yeah, what's left of it.

422
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,763
Now, that's a crime.

423
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,598
Oh, this would have broken
my ex's heart.

424
00:21:40,598 --> 00:21:45,036
Every weekend the guy'd be
test-driving another Mercedes.

425
00:21:45,036 --> 00:21:46,571
I'd get myself all dressed up,

426
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:50,809
make the dealer believe
we could actually afford it.

427
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,178
Damn.

428
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:54,712
If this car was stolen,

429
00:21:54,712 --> 00:21:56,915
the ignition lock would
be punched, right?

430
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:57,982
Huh?

431
00:21:57,982 --> 00:22:01,782
Anyway, I got to go.
Warrick and I are due in court.

432
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,481
Later.

433
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:06,291
We... we would
have caught that.

434
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:10,195
We were distracted
by what we were
looking for.

435
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:11,729
Yeah.

436
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:16,134
So how did the thief
turn the engine over

437
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:19,103
without breaking
that lock?

438
00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:21,799
Maybe
there is no thief.

439
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,809
All right, again.

440
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,811
I ran into the Chinese restaurant.

441
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:30,048
I wasn't in there
more than two minutes,

442
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,951
but I left my keys
in the car.

443
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:36,454
You left
an $80,000 Mercedes idling?

444
00:22:36,454 --> 00:22:37,922
Yeah.

445
00:22:37,922 --> 00:22:39,691
Stupid, right?

446
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,726
That's why I didn't say anything.

447
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:43,995
Besides,
if my insurance finds out,

448
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,830
it's contributory negligence.

449
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,865
Let's just cut to the chase.

450
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,526
I told you everything.

451
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:51,536
Chinese restaurant near my house. Couldn't

452
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,538
Parked in the handicapped zone,
left the motor running.

453
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,540
I wasn't in there
more than a minute.

454
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,542
Take off your shirt, please.

455
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,777
You're going to need a warrant,
like I said.

456
00:22:59,777 --> 00:23:01,212
But you don't
have basis.

457
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:04,545
Actually, the issuing judge
disagrees.

458
00:23:07,218 --> 00:23:10,989
I can call Judge Scott,
contest your grounds.

459
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,724
- But you won't -You want to refuse?

460
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,426
One of us will remove it
for you.

461
00:23:15,426 --> 00:23:18,862
Yeah.

462
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,526
Here you go.

463
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,773
Look, no chemical burns.

464
00:23:28,773 --> 00:23:30,434
You satisfied?

465
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:37,545
The warrant
is for the whole shirt.

466
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,216
Yeah.

467
00:23:48,793 --> 00:23:50,762
You don't have
to be a scientist

468
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,630
to know where that came from.

469
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,564
(tires screeching)

470
00:23:53,564 --> 00:23:55,896
We got enough
for a hit-and-run.

471
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,402
All right, hold on.

472
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,836
It's not what you think.

473
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:00,895
I called in my order.

474
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,541
I looked down to put away
my phone.

475
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:04,909
(bang)

476
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:06,978
I hit something.

477
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:09,347
I stopped. I looked around.

478
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:10,949
I couldn't see anything.

479
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:16,154
I figured it must have been
a dog, and it ran off.

480
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,022
So I drove
to the restaurant,

481
00:24:18,022 --> 00:24:20,458
that's when
my car was stolen.

482
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,728
It was
a rough night.

483
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,363
Look, my car was stolen.

484
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:28,466
What happened next,
I don't know.

485
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:30,935
Save it.

486
00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:32,437
You're under arrest.

487
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:34,735
All right.

488
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,882
I hate lawyers.

489
00:24:44,882 --> 00:24:47,952
We need a warrant for his house.

490
00:24:47,952 --> 00:24:49,620
We need to find something
we can use

491
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,884
to keep that creep off the street.

492
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,496
(panting)

493
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,469
I'm all for retracing
the girl's steps,

494
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:07,005
but it wouldn't hurt
to bring in some cadets.

495
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,308
If it was a little kid
or a mass casualty,

496
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:13,044
maybe we'd get
that kind of manpower,

497
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:16,980
but, hey, exercise is good
for us, right?

498
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,118
Air feels thin to me.

499
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:22,211
(grunting)

500
00:25:35,366 --> 00:25:37,391
Check it out.

501
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,304
Let's go.

502
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:00,792
You said the vic was wearing light layers of

503
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:03,227
Yeah, several layers...
tempered cotton.

504
00:26:03,227 --> 00:26:06,831
This is a men's
extra large.

505
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,032
This is
too big for her.

506
00:26:08,032 --> 00:26:14,038
Goose down like
I found on her body.

507
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:15,801
What's this?

508
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:27,118
Ah. Property of Mr. Muscles.

509
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,085
You want to run it?

510
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:34,092
Well, maybe he left
a day later than he said

511
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:34,992
for his little marathon,
you know?

512
00:26:34,992 --> 00:26:37,728
Followed her out here,
started arguing with her,

513
00:26:37,728 --> 00:26:42,600
no neighbors around
to call the cops.

514
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,601
(shrieks)

515
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,069
She manages
to fight her way free,

516
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:49,974
finds higher ground,
he follows her, takes her down.

517
00:26:49,974 --> 00:26:50,741
So then what?

518
00:26:50,741 --> 00:26:53,608
He drowns her
with canteen water?

519
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,948
I'm going to let you
run that by the D.A.

520
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:00,251
You should try describing
a scuba diver up in a tree, man.

521
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,419
Up in a tree, man.

522
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:02,987
This is nothing.

523
00:27:02,987 --> 00:27:06,390
No, the, uh... the evidence
tells the story.

524
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,760
So why did a cagey guy like our suspect

525
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,091
leave his jacket up here?

526
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,097
Everybody thinks
they have a plan

527
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,100
till things start
to go wrong.

528
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:20,771
I gave Stacy my jacket
the morning she left for Diablo

529
00:27:20,771 --> 00:27:21,772
for night layering.

530
00:27:21,772 --> 00:27:24,408
Extreme hikers
can't carry bedrolls.

531
00:27:24,408 --> 00:27:25,943
That's what makes it extreme.

532
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:30,114
And she just left
your jacket wedged
under some rocks.

533
00:27:30,114 --> 00:27:32,850
Maybe.
I don't know.

534
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,988
Look, I gave it to her
to take care of her.

535
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,390
I loved Stacy.

536
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,993
Then help us out here, man.

537
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:45,696
I've got prior disturbance calls,

538
00:27:45,696 --> 00:27:46,631
her blood in the pool, her body drowned

539
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:50,401
in the middle of the desert
with your jacket nearby...

540
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:52,069
your map.

541
00:27:52,069 --> 00:27:54,906
That's my trail map.
I'd like it back.

542
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:58,376
No. No, it's evidence now.

543
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:00,044
You can put a request in for it

544
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:02,547
when we complete
our investigation, okay?

545
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,248
Am I free to go?

546
00:28:04,248 --> 00:28:06,512
You're not under arrest.

547
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:16,151
I'm getting this to QD.

548
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:19,721
He doesn't want me to have this map, and I

549
00:28:26,804 --> 00:28:28,472
(sighs)

550
00:28:28,472 --> 00:28:29,574
He made bail.

551
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:31,475
Yeah, that figures.

552
00:28:31,475 --> 00:28:32,476
Oh, I almost forgot.

553
00:28:32,476 --> 00:28:35,379
Here's a warrant
to search your premises.

554
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:38,182
We'd like to start
in your garage.

555
00:28:38,182 --> 00:28:40,418
Yeah.

556
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:44,222
Look, I'm filing a complaint
with your supervisor.

557
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,690
You're harassing me.

558
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,959
If you're a lawyer, you should know

559
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:51,190
the legal definition of harassment.

560
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,764
Investigating a crime doesn't quite fit the

561
00:28:53,764 --> 00:28:55,499
However, a false accusation
of harassment

562
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:59,337
within earshot of my colleagues
could be construed as slander.

563
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:00,338
I know the law, too,

564
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:03,705
and I've actually
been in a courtroom.

565
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:27,865
This was parked in
the driveway, wasn't it?

566
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:29,734
Now that's a crime?

567
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:33,004
Jim, could you get
this car moved for us?

568
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:36,774
Unless the keys
are in the ignition, hand them over.

569
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:40,044
It's a rental. You're not on my policy.

570
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,346
Oh, I'm a safe driver.

571
00:29:42,346 --> 00:29:44,780
Wait outside.

572
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:04,435
It smells like bleach to me.

573
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:06,404
I'll check for blood.

574
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,306
Why would he leave
his car outside

575
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:12,376
with the sprinklers on
instead of putting it in here?

576
00:30:12,376 --> 00:30:15,277
Maybe the garage was full.

577
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,028
What exactly do you want me to look

578
00:30:31,028 --> 00:30:33,998
Alterations, erasures,
paper content.

579
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,296
The guy was really nervous about me

580
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,302
Okay, I'll test the components in the inks

581
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,137
and then bombard the paper with different

582
00:30:40,137 --> 00:30:41,172
We'll see what's up.

583
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,406
Sounds good, man.

584
00:30:42,406 --> 00:30:44,742
- Thanks, man. - You bet.

585
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:45,710
Hey, Grissom...

586
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,944
Keep me posted.
I will.

587
00:30:46,944 --> 00:30:50,414
Did you take a look at that maggot from the

588
00:30:50,414 --> 00:30:51,415
Yes.

589
00:30:51,415 --> 00:30:51,949
And?

590
00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:54,151
Well, it belongs
to the family of sarcophagids.

591
00:30:54,151 --> 00:30:55,086
That's as far as I got.

592
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:56,821
You mind taking
another look for me?

593
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,423
Your maggot never
developed, Nick.

594
00:30:59,423 --> 00:31:00,624
It never will.

595
00:31:00,624 --> 00:31:01,258
Why?

596
00:31:01,258 --> 00:31:03,317
It happens to Sarcophagids

597
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,330
when they're exposed to freezing

598
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,332
So, my maggot was stunt ed?

599
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,334
Probably
by frozen air.

600
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,666
Yeah, but we found the vic in the desert.

601
00:31:12,703 --> 00:31:15,039
Well, maybe it was a very cold night.

602
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,337
Mucho frio.

603
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:21,776
Muchas gracias.

604
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:33,789
Come on in, Greg.

605
00:31:38,362 --> 00:31:39,363
Hey.

606
00:31:39,363 --> 00:31:39,930
Hey.

607
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,967
So, I heard about
your cold maggot.

608
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,535
News travels fast.

609
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:45,936
I was thinking...

610
00:31:45,936 --> 00:31:49,673
most people
figure Las Vegas
means "The Strip,"

611
00:31:49,673 --> 00:31:51,876
when it really means
"The Meadows."

612
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:55,513
I'm trying to calculate
barometric pressure here, G.

613
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:56,414
Well, my point is,

614
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,883
Nevada is a
basin -and- range state.

615
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:02,386
Down in the desert basin,
hardly any rain.

616
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:04,588
But, up in the
mountain ranges,

617
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:06,924
it's 40 inches a year.

618
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:09,226
That's more than Seattle,

619
00:32:09,226 --> 00:32:11,762
it's more than San Francisco,
it's more than...

620
00:32:11,762 --> 00:32:13,389
Yeah, yeah. I see
where you're going.

621
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,399
Last week, in Vegas,
perfect weather...

622
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,402
warm, steady barometric
pressure, but...

623
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:22,306
out in Diablo, two days before
I found Stacy Warner's body...

624
00:32:22,306 --> 00:32:24,900
The mountain
shadow effect.

625
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:35,052
That's what
meteorologists call it.

626
00:32:35,052 --> 00:32:37,247
Right.

627
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:41,692
This is Ecklie's Mercedes?

628
00:32:41,692 --> 00:32:45,529
Well, actually, I sold it to him five years ago.

629
00:32:45,529 --> 00:32:48,999
It was in much better condition back then.

630
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:50,601
Hey.

631
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,603
So I checked with Auto Detail.

632
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:57,141
Uh... obviously, if you fill a car up with

633
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,343
or, in our case, blood... it's going to leak
through the bottom.

634
00:32:59,343 --> 00:33:02,646
Dicing wounds with
glass were limited

635
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:04,582
to the upper torso, right?

636
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:07,117
Top of the head, face,
top of shoulders,

637
00:33:07,117 --> 00:33:07,885
and forearms.

638
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:10,187
Which would be consistent
with a head-on crash.

639
00:33:10,187 --> 00:33:15,059
The head of the victim
crashed into the passenger side

640
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,458
of the windshield.

641
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,496
Well, this isn't
the same model or year,

642
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,164
but it's
close enough.

643
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,533
Okay, I'm thinking
that the car

644
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,602
clipped the victim here,

645
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:26,832
and he was catapulted...

646
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:33,038
and he was positioned
something like this.

647
00:33:34,411 --> 00:33:37,815
(glass shattering)

648
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:38,716
So now he's bleeding,

649
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:41,651
and his blood is dripping
onto the mat.

650
00:33:45,856 --> 00:33:48,058
The victim bled out
for two days.

651
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:51,295
Yeah, but he could
have been conscious, right?

652
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:54,565
Until he lost a third of his circulating blood

653
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:58,102
Then the hypovolemic shock
would have set in

654
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:00,237
after approximately 12 hours.

655
00:34:00,237 --> 00:34:02,306
So it's possible
that he was wedged

656
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:05,376
into the windshield
of Ben Weston's Mercedes,

657
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,212
which was parked
in Ben Weston's garage.

658
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,148
We know where Bob Martin was.

659
00:34:11,148 --> 00:34:13,350
Where was Ben Weston?

660
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,185
My guess...

661
00:34:15,185 --> 00:34:19,246
At work,
making a good impression.

662
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:27,357
Sometimes I'm glad
I only deal with dead people.

663
00:34:30,534 --> 00:34:32,525
You know...

664
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:37,530
the tow truck driver said
Weston's Mercedes was totaled.

665
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,578
But the only damage would have been to

666
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,680
He's lying.

667
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,349
Maybe it
wasn't totaled.

668
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,451
I don't remember. I was only interested in

669
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:49,853
You don't know
who phoned it in?

670
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:53,490
It was a guy. What else can I tell you?

671
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,926
Mr. Sullivan, in '96
you were arrested

672
00:34:55,926 --> 00:34:58,121
for vandalism, right?

673
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,931
I was 18.
It was a prank.

674
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:03,367
I hoisted the principal's
station wagon onto the roof of the gym.

675
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,202
St. Ignacias High School, right?

676
00:35:05,202 --> 00:35:07,568
It's funny, but
the registered owner

677
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,574
of the Mercedes
also went to St. Ignacias.

678
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,576
You were in
the same class.

679
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,579
Ben Weston.

680
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,281
That might ring a bell. So what?

681
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,849
He's been arrested on a hit-and-run.

682
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:20,317
He's also under suspicion
for murder.

683
00:35:20,317 --> 00:35:23,787
That makes you an accomplice
after the fact... 20 to life.

684
00:35:23,787 --> 00:35:26,255
Okay, look, all I did

685
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,953
was take his call, take his car. I don't even

686
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:31,962
In high school,
he's the one
who turned me in.

687
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:35,796
He said he wanted
to make it up to me.

688
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,640
Just remind yourself

689
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,632
that usually I bring
the case home.

690
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:49,847
If that garage
floor stain
started out as blood,

691
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,416
the bleach
just degraded it.

692
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:53,884
There's nothing for me
to work with.

693
00:35:53,884 --> 00:35:55,052
Sorry.

694
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:57,321
There goes the slam dunk.

695
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,654
Blood in the garage would have

696
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:04,261
So, is this
his rental car?

697
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:07,628
Sunset Park is two miles
from Ben Weston's house.

698
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,668
I was thinking maybe he used this car to

699
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,570
So we should be able to find
some of the vic's blood

700
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,973
or hair or fibers
from his clothes.

701
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:18,635
No visible trace
of any kind.

702
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,968
Except for this.

703
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,353
So this mountain shadow effect...

704
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,651
the barometric
pressure spikes down,

705
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,457
the temperature
strikes down...

706
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:34,651
Right. Humidity
spikes up.

707
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,726
Moisture in the air
condenses.

708
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:39,463
(thunder crashing)

709
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,658
The mountains get
a flash flood.

710
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,667
You know, I checked with
the National Weather Service.

711
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:47,660
This area got three inches of rain in 20

712
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:52,843
So, she was up here hiking
when the weather changed.

713
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,678
Got nasty in a hurry.

714
00:36:54,678 --> 00:36:56,942
Nothing she could
really do about it.

715
00:36:57,948 --> 00:37:01,679
Then she takes one to the head... on the

716
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,954
She's trying to clear the cobwebs when the

717
00:37:03,954 --> 00:37:06,684
(thunder rumbling)

718
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,330
But it was too late.

719
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:27,010
She drowns in the floodwater.

720
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:31,582
Body gets carried
to the base of the canyon.

721
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,151
A couple hours
worth of sun

722
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:35,219
water dries up.

723
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:38,388
No evidence
of the storm anywhere

724
00:37:38,388 --> 00:37:39,389
except on the vic,

725
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:42,292
who carried traced amounts
of basalt rock with her,

726
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:45,662
and rainwater
in her throat.

727
00:37:45,662 --> 00:37:49,800
(phone ringing)

728
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,734
Stokes.

729
00:37:50,734 --> 00:37:53,504
The map has definitely
been tamper ed with.

730
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:54,872
You sure about that?

731
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:55,506
Positive.

732
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:57,141
Chemical tag in the ink
tells the tale.

733
00:37:57,141 --> 00:38:00,310
Then I shot the map with
300 nanometers just to be sure.

734
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,679
I need you to get
those results to me.

735
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,881
Thought you would.

736
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:05,616
I have a messenger on call.

737
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:10,954
Are you telling me Stacy's death
was an accident?

738
00:38:10,954 --> 00:38:13,624
An accident of nature, yeah.

739
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,859
But you still had
a hand in her death

740
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:18,295
just the same,
didn't you, Mr. Hudson?

741
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:20,464
What are you
talking about?

742
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,533
Why don't you
take a break?

743
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:25,661
Come on over here
for a sec.

744
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,772
You altered the map.

745
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,542
You used the same
color ink as the printer,

746
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,772
but the chemical tag s
in the ink are different.

747
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,802
This is Magic Marker.

748
00:38:37,147 --> 00:38:40,450
When you shine
ultraviolet light on it,

749
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,285
like this...

750
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:43,520
you can see exactly
what you did.

751
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,123
You made this look like
an impenetrable ridge...

752
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:49,493
no way out,
when it's actually a meadow.

753
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,528
If she had a good map, she might have

754
00:38:51,528 --> 00:38:53,792
out of the highlands
by nightfall.

755
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,800
I didn't want her to die.

756
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:58,802
I didn't.

757
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,804
Then why did you alter the map?

758
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,806
We competed.

759
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,799
I'd just run the trail in three days. I didn't want

760
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,809
Am I being charged with murder?

761
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,650
No.

762
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,651
You altered the map,

763
00:39:14,651 --> 00:39:16,353
but you didn't make it rain.

764
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:18,722
What you did isn't a crime...

765
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:22,624
but it is criminal, isn't it?

766
00:39:27,097 --> 00:39:28,530
Come on.

767
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,835
Your entire case
is circumstantial.

768
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,871
Your physical evidence
is pathetic.

769
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,173
You've got, what,
a wrecked car...

770
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:39,176
a white powder
in a rental...

771
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:41,838
and a bleached-out
stain in my garage.

772
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,847
If that's
all you've got,

773
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,714
you won't even
get a filing.

774
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,522
My cell phone.

775
00:39:52,522 --> 00:39:53,056
Yeah.

776
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:55,792
Mitchell Sullivan
found it in your car

777
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:56,560
at his chop shop.

778
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,796
I hope he didn't make
any long-distance calls.

779
00:39:59,796 --> 00:40:00,888
Thanks.

780
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:04,563
It's evidence.

781
00:40:06,169 --> 00:40:07,871
Hey, now it's a party.

782
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:10,965
And I brought the music.

783
00:40:11,241 --> 00:40:12,868
You'll be happy
to know

784
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,878
that there were no long-distanced calls
made on your cell phone.

785
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,880
But there was one call made...

786
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,284
to 911... at 2:30 a.m.
On Tuesday morning,

787
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:24,054
while your car was
still in your possession.

788
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:27,991
911. What's your emergency?

789
00:40:27,991 --> 00:40:29,693
Please help me.

790
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:33,497
I...I can't hear you, sir. You'll have to speak

791
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:35,565
Please help me.

792
00:40:35,565 --> 00:40:37,534
Help...

793
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:41,903
Sir, our system
is not compatible with your cellular phone.

794
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,907
Where are you calling from?

795
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,910
I'm in a garage.

796
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,147
Sir, can you see a street sign?

797
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:52,615
It's dark...

798
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:57,521
Explain it to me, Ben.

799
00:40:57,521 --> 00:41:02,059
How does a lawyer rationalize
something like this?

800
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:05,162
You know the law.

801
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,697
You hit a guy.

802
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,265
It was an accident.

803
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:09,132
Nothing criminal.

804
00:41:09,132 --> 00:41:13,036
But you let it escalate
to first-degree murder.

805
00:41:13,036 --> 00:41:15,505
I spoke with your
senior partner.

806
00:41:15,505 --> 00:41:18,442
It was your first
day on the job.

807
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,010
Big firm.

808
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,311
Big welcome.

809
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:24,314
How many drinks
did you have that night?

810
00:41:24,314 --> 00:41:26,783
Let me guess.

811
00:41:26,783 --> 00:41:29,886
You wanted the alcohol
to wear off

812
00:41:29,886 --> 00:41:31,945
before you called it in, right?

813
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,957
So you decided
to wait it out.

814
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,960
Have a cup of coffee, sober up, then call the

815
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:41,761
But, unfortunately,
Bob Martin woke up.

816
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:44,868
Help me.

817
00:41:44,868 --> 00:41:48,497
Please, help...
help me...

818
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,676
So what do you do now, hmm?

819
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,986
Can't walk into the
emergency room and say, "Hey
this guy was bleeding to death

820
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,989
in my garage while I was eating
mu shu pork."

821
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,992
Sara, there's someone
here to see you.

822
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,357
Not right now.

823
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:13,021
You'll want to talk to It's relevant.

824
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:27,611
I sacrificed to get where I am.

825
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:31,448
My whole life
was leading up
to last Monday.

826
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:34,351
Yeah. It's tough, huh?

827
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:37,421
Fifteen years
to build your dream,

828
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:40,590
and a 15-second phone call
destroys it.

829
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,659
Where did
you find this?

830
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:44,961
Packing up
Bob's stuff.

831
00:42:44,961 --> 00:42:46,430
Found it
on his dresser.

832
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,698
Thought you'd
want to see it.

833
00:42:48,698 --> 00:42:50,723
Thanks.

834
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,391
When a driver hits a pedestrian,

835
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,960
the presumption is
the driver is negligent.

836
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,054
When a driver's been drinking
and he hits a pedestrian,

837
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,766
it's no longer negligence... it's reckless

838
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:26,002
But when a pedestrian
intentionally throws himself

839
00:43:26,002 --> 00:43:27,070
in front of a moving vehicle,

840
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:28,972
then the driver's
no longer responsible.

841
00:43:28,972 --> 00:43:33,076
Legally, he's off the hook.

842
00:43:33,076 --> 00:43:36,379
This suicide letter
was written by Bob Martin

843
00:43:36,379 --> 00:43:37,681
to his wife Charlotte

844
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:40,517
When you hit him
Monday night,

845
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:43,145
it wasn't an accident.

846
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:56,533
You were
off the hook.

847
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:59,900
Until you let him die.

848
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:06,617
