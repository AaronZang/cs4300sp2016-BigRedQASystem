2
00:00:17,346 --> 00:00:21,067
SHOOT!

3
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:06,167
For the kids joy,
in the circus ring...

4
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,045
...the tiniest army
in the world.

5
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,469
Turn around!

6
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,851
I said turn around!

7
00:02:22,932 --> 00:02:24,051
OK.. OK.

8
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,603
Go for it.

9
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,446
Flip the gun.

10
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,031
OK... here.

11
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,458
What's happening?

12
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,585
Shall we go?

13
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,919
Wait a second.

14
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:54,382
I couldn't even stand the circus
when I was a kid.

15
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,968
Makes me sad.

16
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,889
Danilo, what are you doing?

17
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,850
Admiral, do something!

18
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:08,479
No Danilo, you can't do that!
Get out!

19
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,065
Get out of here! Everyone out!

20
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:17,238
And now the most important
part of the show...

21
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,949
I've had enough. See you
at the paper tomorrow.

22
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,159
OK, bye.

23
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:25,830
The Wonderland Circus presents,
the queen of the amazons...

24
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,000
...the extraordinary, fantastic...

25
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,461
...Giuditta!

26
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:36,025
Another hand for our
extraordinary Giuditta!

27
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,166
And now, friends,
something never seen...

28
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,459
...to date in a circus ring.

29
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,754
Giuditta will hit...

30
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:01,092
...and burst the balloons
with her rifle...

31
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,178
...at full gallop.

32
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,057
Go for it, Giuditta,
we're all behind you!

33
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:13,604
Kids, pick the color of the balloon
Giuditta will burst.

34
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,231
C'mon, a color!

35
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:20,653
Red! Red! Red!

36
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,455
Another color, c'mon!

37
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,959
Green! Green! Green!

38
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,595
The yellow, Giuditta,
the yellow.

39
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,479
Blue! Blue! Blue!

40
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,190
Another balloon, you hear?
The blue!

41
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,533
It will only take a second.

42
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,828
I don't want to talk to you.

43
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:11,846
Please, Anna.

44
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,415
I'm tired.

45
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,459
What do you want?

46
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,173
I'm Marcos Valles,
journalist at "El Pais".

47
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,508
This is Fernando.

48
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:25,008
And so?

49
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,970
I'm reporting on the circus
for the weekend insert.

50
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:31,933
I'd like to ask you a few questions,
take some shots, if that's OK.

51
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,770
What do you pay?

52
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:36,687
Sorry?

53
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,439
What do you pay?

54
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:43,027
It's just few questions
on your work, I don't...

55
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,029
How much will you pay me?

56
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,199
We'll make an agreement...

57
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,870
Giuditta, are you German?

58
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,832
I'm Italian. My name is Anna.

59
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,584
Giuditta's my stage name.

60
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,255
Are you going to publish
my photo?

61
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,840
Of course.

62
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,008
I'll become famous.

63
00:07:06,268 --> 00:07:07,335
Why not?

64
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,556
I never read the paper.
I like TV.

65
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,642
Anna, when are you going
to teach me to shoot?

66
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,728
When you grow up.

67
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,398
You have to be strong
to handle a rifle.

68
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:24,443
I do gym every day,
Mom gave me permission.

69
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,279
She said I'm old enough.

70
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:30,366
When you're a little older...

71
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,578
...we'll do a number together, OK?

72
00:07:33,691 --> 00:07:34,578
Ok.

73
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,914
"Giuditta and Karen".

74
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,959
No wait... "Karen and Giuditta"!

75
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,294
Alright!

76
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,380
Anna, when can we talk?
Half and hour would do.

77
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,131
I don't know...

78
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,884
- Anna, ready for the bows.
- Coming!

79
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,802
How about tomorrow?

80
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,429
Maybe...

81
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:53,614
...maybe...

82
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,316
What time?

83
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,654
She's beating around the bush.

84
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,781
I like her.

85
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:18,122
In the neighborhoods where homelessness,
sadness, and desperation rule...

86
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,250
...there's a magic place, a forgotten
world inhabited by strange people...

87
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,629
...who dedicate their life
to a disappearing art...

88
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,464
...the circus.

89
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:27,924
Fine.

90
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:33,804
And it's possible to encounter a woman
of fragile beauty, unexpected...

91
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,390
...who can shoot like Buffalo Bill.

92
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,353
No, cut "Buffalo Bill".

93
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,819
<i>Marcos? I know you're there.</i>

94
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,447
<i>It's Laura, pick up!</i>

95
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,534
<i>I know you're listening...</i>
<i>You there?</i>

96
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,868
I already said no.

97
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,954
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>
<i>What have I done?</i>

98
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,374
Too difficult to explain.

99
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,334
<i>You're a son of a bitch!</i>

100
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,537
It's the guy from yesterday.

101
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:05,931
Hello.

102
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,083
Good morning.

103
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,174
Did you come to interview her
or to see her?

104
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,467
Karen, please.

105
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:20,304
Well... for both things.

106
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,684
Can we talk?
It's for the article.

107
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,602
I don't have much to say.

108
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,563
What's your name?

109
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,651
Anna Meltzer.

110
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:39,448
Passport number 841...

111
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,702
...8492.

112
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,955
Where are you from?

113
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,626
Bolzano, Italy.

114
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,839
Have you done this work
for a long time?

115
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,929
Fifteen years.

116
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,183
Are your parents
with the circus?

117
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:16,068
Listen... my father
is a driver for Ferrari.

118
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,154
A driver.

119
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,073
My mother is a
Russian ballerina.

120
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,535
From Minsk, Bielorussia.

121
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,539
My mother is an
extraordinary dancer.

122
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,209
Svetlana Pavlova, you know her?

123
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,463
Pavlova. The great Pavlova.

124
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,507
Svetlana Pavlova. Svetlana.

125
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:45,014
She's the daughter
of the Czar of Russia's...

126
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,599
...cousin.

127
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:50,060
She's very famous.
The world idolizes her.

128
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,062
Strange you don't know her.

129
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,525
I've never been interested
in dancing.

130
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,446
I've always had a mad passion...

131
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,199
...for horses and guns.

132
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,243
My Cossack blood, no doubt.

133
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,411
No doubt.

134
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,747
I was an extraordinary child.

135
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,416
If they gave me a "bambola"...

136
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,419
- A doll.
- A doll.

137
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,214
I would cry desperately...

138
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,049
...but so desperately...

139
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:21,149
Why?

140
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:26,597
Why? Because I wanted a gun,
a rifle, a shotgun...

141
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,557
...and a horse.

142
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:31,157
I see.

143
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,855
Why don't we just drop it?

144
00:13:35,436 --> 00:13:36,555
Ok.

145
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,993
My parents were trapeze artists.

146
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:55,960
They wanted me to do the same.

147
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,923
But I have vertigo.

148
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,928
My first boyfriend taught me
how to shoot.

149
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:11,141
I was 13, he was almost 30.

150
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:16,522
We worked together six months.

151
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,191
And then you got bored
with him.

152
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,488
He was an imbecile.

153
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,575
But don't write that.

154
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,963
- Do you like your work?
- Yes.

155
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,298
I'm very good.

156
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,009
I could be in a bigger
circus, or in Las Vegas...

157
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:49,138
...but I like this small circus...

158
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,432
...it's like family.

159
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,355
Have you ever shot?

160
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:03,193
When I was young
I shot a BB gun.

161
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,820
No military service?

162
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,658
Never been hunting?

163
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,412
I'm the interviewer,
but I'll answer you.

164
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,206
I'm against hunting...

165
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,751
...and I hate fire-arms.

166
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,086
Here!

167
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,671
Careful, it's loaded.

168
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,673
What do I do now?

169
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,385
Aim and pull the trigger.

170
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,762
- Trigger...
- Yes...

171
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,305
And shoot.

172
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,348
Good.

173
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,726
That's simple.
What if I kill someone?

174
00:15:35,873 --> 00:15:37,626
Who?

175
00:15:38,864 --> 00:15:41,231
OK, wait, let's see...

176
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,777
Legs, one in front
and one behind.

177
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:45,986
And flex, correct?

178
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,155
Yes, if you want to...

179
00:15:52,053 --> 00:15:53,955
Let's see...

180
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,288
- You have it?
- Yes...

181
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,247
Shoot!

182
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,043
Wow!

183
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,769
Again.

184
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,979
- I almost did it, huh?
- Yes.

185
00:16:07,094 --> 00:16:07,979
Now.

186
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,844
...take a deep breath...

187
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,014
...aiming at the second one.

188
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,686
Hold your breath...

189
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,437
...and shoot.

190
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:24,208
Again.

191
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:26,360
I'll load now.

192
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,446
- Fine.
- I like this.

193
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,410
Again.

194
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,581
- Why?
- No, I 'm not made for this, you go.

195
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,251
- No more?
- No, I want to see you shoot.

196
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,881
Want to make a bet?

197
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,718
Make a bet?

198
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,265
Well, if you hit all the cans...

199
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,934
...you'll give me a kiss.

200
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,813
- That's not fair.
- Why?

201
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:04,815
Nothing personal.

202
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,484
It's got to be money.

203
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,570
A large bill. You have it?

204
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,909
All I have is this.

205
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,412
A true reporter!

206
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,128
Take it or leave it!

207
00:17:56,293 --> 00:17:58,728
Shit...

208
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,919
It's confirmed, Marcos.

209
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,463
You're off to Barcelona tomorrow
to cover the concert.

210
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,173
That's annoying.

211
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,801
Can't anyone else go?

212
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,720
It was settled you'd go.

213
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:20,099
Can't Carlos go?

214
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,392
You can't back out now.

215
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,899
Have fun in Barcelona.

216
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,701
What's up? You done?

217
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,162
Fuck no, everyone keeps
bothering me.

218
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,413
OK. I'm going.

219
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,499
Those from the circus?

220
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,769
- Anna!
- Who's there?

221
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,192
How are you reporter?
Come in.

222
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,776
If I'm disturbing...

223
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,987
Come in and shut the door,
it's cold.

224
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,700
Want a drink?

225
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:03,500
Well, yes... yes.

226
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,362
A beer.

227
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,164
- Help yourself.
- OK.

228
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:08,832
Thanks.

229
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,175
You haven't finished
your article?

230
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:19,826
More or less.

231
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,346
I came to show you the photos.

232
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,972
I'll be right there.

233
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,359
So you live here.

234
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,529
It's my home,
what do you think?

235
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,536
If this is where you live...
I like it.

236
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,455
Look.

237
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,084
This one's nice.

238
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,545
No! Careful, it's oily,
they'll get dirty.

239
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:03,895
Look.

240
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,181
I love this one.

241
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,062
And this one. Your particular way
of saying "goodnight".

242
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,605
Of course.

243
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,151
Look, look...

244
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,696
This one with the little girl
is beautiful.

245
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,865
They're all of me.

246
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,575
What about the others?

247
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,869
I just brought yours.

248
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,874
Can I keep one?

249
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,543
They're all for you.

250
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,253
No. I just want one.

251
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:39,756
But which one?

252
00:21:42,518 --> 00:21:43,802
Let me see...

253
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,887
This one...

254
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:47,973
This one.

255
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:50,675
This one?

256
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,775
These are for you. A gift.

257
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,158
Will you sign one?

258
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,910
Of course.

259
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,250
Got a pen?

260
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,344
Can I write in Italian?

261
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,263
In whatever language you feel.

262
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,561
Can I turn the TV off?

263
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,761
Yes, yes.

264
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,158
Shoot...

265
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,579
...and get it out of your system.

266
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,548
What now?

267
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,765
What do you mean?

268
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,145
With your paper, what will
they do with the photos?

269
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,941
The article and the photos
will appear in the supplement.

270
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,904
Everyone reads it,
it's great promotion.

271
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,952
We're leaving Friday.

272
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,454
You're leaving?

273
00:23:39,678 --> 00:23:40,654
Where to?

274
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,926
France, then Germany.

275
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,306
When are you returning
to Madrid?

276
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,016
I don't know...

277
00:23:56,457 --> 00:23:57,716
In a year.

278
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,608
Maybe less, I don't know.

279
00:24:08,672 --> 00:24:09,608
Fine...

280
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,661
Well...

281
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:18,948
...I'm leaving.

282
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,546
Have you eaten?

283
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,221
Let me invite you out.

284
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,976
Let me invite you.

285
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,564
It's a special night because...

286
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:49,488
...Mary and Bruno got engaged
and we're celebrating.

287
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,205
Pedro, this is Marcos...

288
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,040
...Sheila...

289
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,460
Rashi, this is Marcos.

290
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,976
Thank you.

291
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,970
- A little wine?
- Thanks.

292
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,641
- And you?
- Yes, thanks.

293
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,818
Do the circus people marry
among themselves?

294
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,822
Yes, if you want to keep
working in the circus.

295
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,824
That's how it is.

296
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,078
It's difficult to find someone
to share your life.

297
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,457
We're gypsies.

298
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,044
With no home,
always here and there.

299
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,006
If you live with someone
not from the circus...

300
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:54,010
...either you leave the circus
or they leave you.

301
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,432
See that fat bald man?

302
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,032
Yes.

303
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,688
He fell in love with Ursula,
the girl next to him.

304
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:06,982
He left everything...

305
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,734
...and came to live with her.

306
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:14,573
He had a delicatessen
in Stoccarda.

307
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:15,865
"Stoccarda"?

308
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,451
Stuttgart.

309
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:24,165
Well, he left everything,
and there you have him.

310
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,153
And you?

311
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,932
You look handsomer
without glasses.

312
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:46,021
I don't know how to do
anything else.

313
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,568
Sometimes I dream of having
a millionaire lover...

314
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,615
...a romantic villa,
with two floors...

315
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:02,495
...a terrace that stretches
as far as a lake...

316
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:07,417
...and in the lake is my boat,
my private boat.

317
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,672
Lots of... swans in the water.

318
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,773
- Swans.
- Swans.

319
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,052
A garden
with wonderful flowers...

320
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,429
...and at least 10 kids.

321
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:20,880
Only?

322
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,558
Silence!

323
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,643
Silence, please!

324
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,482
Sara wants to say a few words.

325
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,446
Dear friends!

326
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,782
Tony, light!

327
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:44,913
Dear friends, though the circus
has known better times...

328
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:49,501
...we're here to prove
the circus will never die.

329
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:53,421
If it does, that the fuck
will we live from?

330
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,467
Tony, light on the fiancees...

331
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,310
...our friends, Bruno and Marry...

332
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,271
...have decided to join
their lives! For this...

333
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:14,401
...the great circus family
wants to wish them happiness...

334
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,403
...and to their children...

335
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:20,448
...their children's children,
and children's children's children!

336
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,657
Anyway...

337
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:25,203
...that they may all
work in the circus!

338
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,046
For them, for the circus!

339
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:50,687
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

340
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,135
You have to take a deep breath.

341
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,276
To your happiness.

342
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,476
To Mary and Bruno.

343
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,143
To Them.

344
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,312
Your new companion?

345
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,815
He's a friend. A reporter.

346
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:36,858
A reporter?

347
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,403
Happiness to you too, reporter.

348
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:44,949
Be careful.
She's a very dangerous woman.

349
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,744
If you misbehave...

350
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:57,045
Let's dance!

351
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,671
Dance with me!

352
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,258
Yes. Yes. Yes.

353
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:01,758
No, I can't dance.

354
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,545
I know nothing about you.

355
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,841
More than I know of you.

356
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,260
You interviewed me, didn't you?

357
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,143
I know you had your
first boyfriend at 13.

358
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,438
No, I exaggerated.

359
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,938
I was 16...

360
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,363
...and a little stupid
when I was with that jerk.

361
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,075
- And then?
- Then what?

362
00:33:15,101 --> 00:33:16,511
How many men
have you known?

363
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,706
- Already jealous?
- No.

364
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,499
No? And you?

365
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:22,699
Me?

366
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,919
How many men have I known?

367
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,133
How old were you when you had
your first woman?

368
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,739
- Wasn't a lot of fun.
- No?

369
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,227
Almost didn't notice.

370
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:45,440
I don't know, I was 18 or 19.

371
00:33:46,407 --> 00:33:47,408
Truth is...

372
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,195
...I was a late bloomer.

373
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:57,535
However, later...
I made up for lost time!

374
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,648
We're leaving Friday.

375
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,155
I'll follow you.

376
00:34:40,269 --> 00:34:41,696
What if I go to Russia?

377
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:46,409
I'll cry.

378
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:54,842
No, I'll follow you to hell.

379
00:35:06,379 --> 00:35:07,513
When are you coming back?

380
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,149
Tomorrow morning.

381
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:11,659
Call me?

382
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:13,920
Take care.

383
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,823
I'll call from Barcelona.

384
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,031
I was strolling in the park...

385
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,035
...and I saw a white horse
shiny, beautiful...

386
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,871
Are you listening?

387
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:08,908
And suddenly...

388
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,086
...he sprung wings.
I was impressed.

389
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,421
A horse with wings!

390
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,590
A little strange, no?

391
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,468
I went close to the horse.
Then...

392
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:23,556
...I went close to the horse
and he said.

393
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,766
"Climb up...

394
00:36:25,931 --> 00:36:26,966
...we'll fly."

395
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,519
So I climbed up.

396
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,814
And when we were flying...

397
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:32,607
Should I stop?

398
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,775
Then from the sky...

399
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:36,994
...I saw a field.

400
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:38,154
Should I stop?

401
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,448
Yeah, yeah, stop.

402
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,914
Telephone!

403
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,792
It's me, Marcos.

404
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:53,920
How are you?

405
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,173
Fine. Slept 'till noon, and you?

406
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,300
Little tired, but fine.

407
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,887
Can't stop thinking about you.

408
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,306
We're done, chief.

409
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,938
Where are you,
what's that noise?

410
00:37:12,338 --> 00:37:14,181
I'm in a concert hall.

411
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,237
Would you like to see
the show tonight?

412
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:20,488
Alright.

413
00:37:22,832 --> 00:37:23,674
Three?

414
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:24,575
When are you coming back?

415
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,329
Don't know.
The concert finishes late.

416
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,540
If I'm not dead tired,
I'll be back in the morning.

417
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,284
Thank you.

418
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,452
Welcome.

419
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,633
I love you.

420
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,385
Goodbye.

421
00:37:42,984 --> 00:37:43,885
A kiss.

422
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,299
New guy?

423
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,981
Naked! Naked!

424
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,010
Naked!

425
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,479
Try to get this!

426
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,235
She's crazy, why does she do it?

427
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:49,744
What you've done is
unprofessional! It's rash.

428
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,578
I know.

429
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,746
You're right.

430
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:55,166
Those three assholes bothered me
throughout my act...

431
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,678
It won't happen again.

432
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,694
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

433
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,529
Wait, wait don't go away.

434
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:27,782
This is Paco...

435
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,451
...Mario, and I'm Juan.

436
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,411
You were out of sight.

437
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,205
You're an impressive chick.

438
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:35,915
We like you a lot.

439
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,793
No shit! You're a great shot.

440
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,837
Come on and have a drink.

441
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,422
- I can't.
- C'mon!

442
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,758
C'mon, come with us.

443
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,011
I'm sure you won't regret it.

444
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,264
I'm tired, some other time.

445
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,808
Fuck, let loose.

446
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:56,435
Let me through. Don't touch me!
Leave me alone!

447
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:00,189
Chill out.
Fuck, we just want to be friendly.

448
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,649
What do you want?

449
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,243
Go home.

450
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,997
C'mon Mario.
He's a crazy asshole.

451
00:40:17,089 --> 00:40:18,082
Let go of me.

452
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:40,187
<i>Miss Mariana, please.</i>
<i>I met her in the convent.</i>

453
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,022
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

454
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,817
<i>...we had a tragedy at home.</i>

455
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,519
<i>Miss Mariana is...</i>

456
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:49,830
<i>She can't see you.</i>

457
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:54,577
<i>I know madam.</i>
<i>That's why I wanted to see her...</i>

458
00:40:57,281 --> 00:40:58,277
<i>Anyway...</i>

459
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,374
<i>Please convey to her...</i>

460
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,501
<i>...my good wishes.</i>

461
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,962
<i>I won't be seeing her.</i>

462
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,009
<i>I'm returning to Buenos Aires.</i>

463
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,555
<i>What name?</i>

464
00:41:16,324 --> 00:41:18,717
<i>Raoul, Raoul.</i>

465
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:44,168
<i>Nothing bad will happen</i>
<i>while you're at my side.</i>

466
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,924
<i>You won't allow anything</i>
<i>to happen, right Johnny?</i>

467
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:05,940
Who is it?

468
00:42:06,507 --> 00:42:07,307
It's me.

469
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,986
Marcos... wait a moment.

470
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,496
I'll be right there.

471
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,269
Shut up!

472
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,022
Put the volume up!

473
00:42:49,558 --> 00:42:50,500
Stay still!

474
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,486
You're gonna suffocate her!

475
00:42:53,796 --> 00:42:54,813
Quiet!

476
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,996
Stop shouting!
I'll bust your face! Shut up!

477
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:34,820
Stop...

478
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:37,364
...please stop...

479
00:43:50,986 --> 00:43:51,929
Quiet!

480
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:52,921
Turn her around.

481
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,254
C'mon. Your turn.

482
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:38,592
Come on!

483
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,262
C'mon, what're
you waiting for?

484
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,474
C'mon! Have some fun!

485
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,982
What are you doing?

486
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,360
Hold her down.

487
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,407
Nobody fucks with me.
Let alone you, you whore.

488
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,659
Get it, Giudatta?

489
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,269
I didn't want to!
I didn't...

490
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,160
Where are you?

491
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:11,474
Good morning.

492
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:24,729
It's me, Marcos.

493
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,882
What the fuck is this?

494
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:41,166
Good morning.

495
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,126
Coffee with milk, please.

496
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:43,918
Fine.

497
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:46,588
And a cognac.

498
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:47,755
Right away.

499
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,702
You can't believe
the house Puri bought.

500
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,329
It's fabulous.

501
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,331
Gorgeous.

502
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:23,499
Everything's marble.

503
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:24,652
Dear me...

504
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:26,252
Dear nothing.

505
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:30,840
It's great, and I'm still poor.
I'm fed up!

506
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,175
Pass the cologne.

507
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:33,426
It's very good.

508
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,637
Let's see. Lovely.

509
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,014
Good smell. I like it.

510
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:42,060
I'm exhausted... all night,
all night long.

511
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,561
It's disgusting.

512
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,621
<i>You've reached Marcos Valles...</i>

513
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:06,042
<i>...you can leave a message</i>
<i>after the beep.</i>

514
00:59:06,718 --> 00:59:07,660
<i>Thank you.</i>

515
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,476
It was horrible...

516
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,440
Horrible...

517
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,921
<i>Now for the national news.</i>

518
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:57,176
<i>This morning, 8:30 am,</i>
<i>a triple murder was committed.</i>

519
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:59,387
<i>Francisco Arroyo, 19...</i>

520
00:59:59,938 --> 01:00:01,689
<i>...J. De la Encina, 24...</i>

521
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:04,667
<i>...and M.R. Benegas, 23...</i>

522
01:00:04,918 --> 01:00:09,689
<i>...were shot at close range</i>
<i>this morning in the garage...</i>

523
01:00:09,781 --> 01:00:11,607
<i>...''Rodauto'' in Fuenlabrada.</i>

524
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,444
<i>Motive of this execution</i>
<i>is unknown.</i>

525
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:19,615
<i>It could be a drug</i>
<i>related gang shooting.</i>

526
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:24,037
<i>A terrorist act</i>
<i>is however not discarded.</i>

527
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:28,166
<i>We are with the garage owner</i>
<i>in Fuenlabrada.</i>

528
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:29,959
<i>Any motive for this crime?</i>

529
01:00:30,235 --> 01:00:33,046
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I don't see any.</i>

530
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:35,381
<i>They were three boys...</i>

531
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:36,716
<i>...hardworking, good...</i>

532
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:37,717
<i>Did you see what happened?</i>

533
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:41,846
<i>I opened the garage,</i>
<i>as I do every morning...</i>

534
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:43,556
<i>...and went up to my office.</i>

535
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:46,976
<i>They arrived on their motorbikes,</i>
<i>I told them what to do.</i>

536
01:00:47,961 --> 01:00:49,020
<i>One welded...</i>

537
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:52,857
<i>...the other did motors and...</i>
<i>Mario there...</i>

538
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:55,401
<i>I was in the office.</i>

539
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,695
<i>He had long messy hair,</i>
<i>and a big jacket...</i>

540
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,448
<i>...the rifle was pointed</i>
<i>at the floor.</i>

541
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:09,749
<i>I saw Mario fall to the ground</i>
<i>the killer walked over him...</i>

542
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:11,584
<i>...as if nothing...</i>

543
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:16,798
- Sweetheart, wake up... I'm in a hurry.
<i>- I thought it was a film...</i>

544
01:01:16,901 --> 01:01:18,398
<i>...or a TV show.</i>

545
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:20,093
<i>I ran down...</i>

546
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,470
<i>...and saw Mario was dead.</i>

547
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,727
<i>Then he drove away...</i>

548
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:32,063
<i>...in a grey Renault I think...</i>

549
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:37,318
<i>Then Juan and Paco...</i>

550
01:01:38,207 --> 01:01:39,618
<i>...all dead...</i>

551
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,329
Good morning.

552
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:49,705
- What'll you have?
- Coffee and milk.

553
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:51,082
Black for me.

554
01:01:51,816 --> 01:01:54,810
<i>My God!</i>

555
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:02,427
It was a bad accident.

556
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:04,679
Were they hospitalized?

557
01:02:04,746 --> 01:02:06,973
Yes, in intensive care.

558
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:43,468
<i>...years, were shot this morning...</i>

559
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:48,139
<i>...in a garage in Fuenlabrada.</i>

560
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:53,144
<i>Marcos, it's Fernando,</i>
<i>call when you can.</i>

561
01:03:00,776 --> 01:03:02,153
<i>It was horrible...</i>

562
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:07,658
<i>...horrible...</i>

563
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:10,995
<i>It was horrible.</i>

564
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:14,832
<i>They were three good kids...</i>

565
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,000
<i>You saw what happened?</i>

566
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:20,421
<i>I opened up like always...</i>

567
01:03:22,824 --> 01:03:24,884
<i>...they came on their</i>
<i>bikes and began...</i>

568
01:03:25,827 --> 01:03:27,178
<i>...horrible...</i>

569
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:31,307
<i>...one on engines and</i>
<i>Mario there...</i>

570
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:36,479
<i>They started working...</i>
<i>I was checking some papers...</i>

571
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:40,066
<i>As I said, I was in my office...</i>

572
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:43,611
<i>...he had long hair...</i>

573
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:46,239
<i>...messy, wore a big jacket...</i>

574
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:49,992
<i>...the rifle was pointed</i>
<i>to the floor.</i>

575
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,495
<i>I saw Mario fall...</i>

576
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,997
<i>...to the ground,</i>
<i>he walked over him.</i>

577
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:28,364
Excuse me...

578
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,408
...are you the garage owner?

579
01:04:30,475 --> 01:04:34,745
More press. Enough already. I can't
stand it, I've told them everything.

580
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:36,747
Wait... I don't want
to bother you.

581
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:39,041
Just one thing...

582
01:04:47,533 --> 01:04:48,384
Is it her?

583
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:54,515
A woman...

584
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:58,269
Can't be. A woman
wouldn't do such a thing.

585
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,984
<i>The hair was long and messy...</i>

586
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:07,987
<i>...boys wear their hair like that.</i>

587
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:10,615
<i>Wore a big jacket...</i>

588
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:13,492
<i>The rifle</i>
<i>pointed to the floor...</i>

589
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,830
Got a second?

590
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:19,749
Leave it...

591
01:05:21,492 --> 01:05:22,293
What's up?

592
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:26,380
You covering the killing?
Those 3 guys...

593
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:27,590
- From the garage?
- Yes.

594
01:05:27,689 --> 01:05:28,790
Fuck, yes.

595
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:32,887
Before breakfast I had to
stare at three bodies.

596
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,430
Some job!

597
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:36,223
Anything new?

598
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:37,558
Not that I know of.

599
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:41,479
One had a file
for theft and rape.

600
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,899
Not much on the other two.
Some drug stuff...

601
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:49,028
Police think it's a hit
between dealers...

602
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:49,987
Come with me.

603
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:03,292
You have to help me.

604
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:06,545
I'm not completely sure.

605
01:06:08,573 --> 01:06:10,591
It's sort of a hunch.

606
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,009
What is it about?

607
01:06:14,317 --> 01:06:15,209
Ok.

608
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:19,558
The girl who blew them away...

609
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:23,104
...could be my girlfriend.

610
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:28,693
Are you in a mess?

611
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:30,319
No, no, not me.

612
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:34,365
Only you can help me.

613
01:06:34,499 --> 01:06:36,033
What can I do?

614
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:39,495
You get stuff from the police.

615
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:42,540
I know nothing about that world...

616
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:46,585
I have to find her.

617
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:55,469
No, it's stupid, forget it.

618
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,931
I'm making a mistake,
makes no sense.

619
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,271
I'll call you
if I hear something.

620
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,902
You're torn and hemorrhaging.

621
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:55,404
You have to go to a hospital.

622
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:04,455
What happened?

623
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:09,551
I was raped.

624
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:12,755
Did you tell the police?

625
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:16,942
Not yet.

626
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:18,677
Do it immediately.

627
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:22,807
You can dress.

628
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,246
Thank you.

629
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:52,336
This will calm the pain,
but you must go to the hospital...

630
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,380
..you're losing a lot of blood.

631
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:56,841
I can't do more here.

632
01:08:57,842 --> 01:08:58,801
Do you have a car?

633
01:08:59,051 --> 01:09:00,678
Yes, it's outside.

634
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:18,320
Go to the Ciudad Real hospital.

635
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,282
Tell them what happened.

636
01:09:21,332 --> 01:09:22,841
No, I can't.

637
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:23,993
Don't be afraid.

638
01:09:24,477 --> 01:09:26,203
Ask for Dr. Nunez.

639
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:29,206
Tell him I sent you.

640
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:33,602
Give him this.

641
01:09:37,615 --> 01:09:39,525
Go there quickly.

642
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,553
What do I owe...

643
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:44,388
Nothing.

644
01:09:45,464 --> 01:09:46,323
Thanks.

645
01:09:51,028 --> 01:09:52,070
Please...

646
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:55,232
...don't tell anyone.

647
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:59,862
Sexual assault is a crime,
they got to be punished.

648
01:09:59,996 --> 01:10:00,905
Yes, I know.

649
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:07,244
I'll think about it,
but please don't say anything.

650
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:17,588
Just a moment, please.

651
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:30,935
Is this the police?

652
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:53,929
Good afternoon.

653
01:13:54,455 --> 01:13:55,222
Something wrong?

654
01:13:57,333 --> 01:14:01,270
No, I was resting.
I'm exhausted.

655
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:03,522
Car papers and
drivers license.

656
01:14:20,314 --> 01:14:21,290
Italian?

657
01:14:21,774 --> 01:14:22,541
Tourist?

658
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:23,834
Tourist.

659
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:27,212
What's a pretty girl like you
doing alone in this desert?

660
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,385
Going to Madrid.

661
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:35,737
It's not the fastest way.

662
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:37,723
You made a mistake.

663
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:40,017
Should've turned at the detour.

664
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,103
Oh yes? Thank you.

665
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,772
I'll turn and go back...

666
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:47,858
Should I accompany you?

667
01:14:48,742 --> 01:14:49,526
Can I go?

668
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:51,195
No, just a moment.

669
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:01,830
What's in your bag?

670
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:07,711
Traveling clothes...
my things, nothing.

671
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:09,671
Please step out
and open the bag.

672
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:12,799
Step out!

673
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:15,135
Leave her alone,
she's just a tourist.

674
01:15:15,144 --> 01:15:16,053
Get out!

675
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:29,358
Come on. Get the bag.

676
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:42,347
<i>Rain is strong enough</i>
<i>to penetrate the sand.</i>

677
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:45,475
<i>A meter approximately...</i>

678
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:49,771
<i>...and wakes an animal</i>
<i>that is suprising to find...</i>

679
01:16:49,805 --> 01:16:52,649
<i>...in a desert. A frog.</i>

680
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:55,902
<i>There are numerous frogs...</i>

681
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:59,531
<i>...who suprisingly survive</i>
<i>in droughts.</i>

682
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:03,327
<i>They hide beneath the earth</i>
<i>for years...</i>

683
01:17:03,535 --> 01:17:05,454
<i>...wrapped in a second skin...</i>

684
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,706
<i>...to keep their bodies humid.</i>

685
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:15,964
<i>This provides the first meal</i>
<i>when waters touch and ends a sleep...</i>

686
01:17:16,214 --> 01:17:18,800
<i>...which could have lasted 5 years.</i>

687
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:34,441
<i>Then follows a brief,</i>
<i>but glorious freedom...</i>

688
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:37,402
<i>...during which they eat</i>
<i>and reproduce...</i>

689
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:42,866
<i>...until dreyness sends the frogs</i>
<i>back into their time capsule.</i>

690
01:17:50,123 --> 01:17:50,916
Hi Manuel.

691
01:17:58,073 --> 01:17:58,940
What?

692
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:04,388
Where did it happen?

693
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:08,350
I'm going.

694
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:12,562
Pick you up in ten minutes. Bye.

695
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:27,554
What's your name?

696
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:28,805
Alberto.

697
01:19:29,389 --> 01:19:30,599
Your nose is bleeding.

698
01:19:34,352 --> 01:19:35,854
And a scratch on your face.

699
01:19:38,982 --> 01:19:40,358
Where do you live?

700
01:19:40,817 --> 01:19:42,235
Over in that house.

701
01:19:57,926 --> 01:19:58,785
Doesn't start.

702
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:04,216
What's your name?

703
01:20:05,409 --> 01:20:07,052
My name? Anna.

704
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:09,596
Where d'you live?

705
01:20:11,556 --> 01:20:12,390
Don't know.

706
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:14,935
How can you not know?

707
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:17,646
No... Here and there.

708
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,038
Mom... There's a lady.

709
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:36,748
A lady... Let her in.

710
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,584
Come in, come in. Good evening.
What do you want?

711
01:20:40,794 --> 01:20:43,088
My God, what's wrong?
You're hurt.

712
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:46,800
It's nothing.
I had a car accident, and...

713
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:49,135
A drink? Like to rest?

714
01:20:49,761 --> 01:20:51,388
- Some water.
- Son, get some water, quick.

715
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:52,430
Come in, come in.

716
01:20:56,226 --> 01:20:57,143
Are you feeling ill?

717
01:20:57,769 --> 01:21:00,105
- It's nothing.
- Come along.

718
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:04,793
Lie down a little.

719
01:21:05,761 --> 01:21:07,128
Are you a hunter?

720
01:21:07,561 --> 01:21:08,428
Yes.

721
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:14,369
Drink this.

722
01:21:19,749 --> 01:21:20,584
Thank you.

723
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:21,793
Lie down now.

724
01:21:52,015 --> 01:21:53,091
Her name is Anna.

725
01:22:08,965 --> 01:22:10,842
I won't use the information
I have on her.

726
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:15,931
Don't even insinuate it,
you know me better.

727
01:22:16,222 --> 01:22:18,391
In something of this sort...

728
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:20,852
...I don't even know my parents.

729
01:22:21,253 --> 01:22:22,854
Well, I'm different.

730
01:22:22,963 --> 01:22:24,022
Are you sure?

731
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:27,275
If you're involved...

732
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:30,528
...why take her diary?

733
01:22:30,695 --> 01:22:32,948
This diary is worth a fortune.

734
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:39,663
Don't know.
Why d'you say that?

735
01:22:45,168 --> 01:22:48,922
People are morbid,
they love a tragedy...

736
01:22:49,547 --> 01:22:51,758
...as long as they're not involved.

737
01:22:51,867 --> 01:22:53,443
Isn't that sad?

738
01:22:54,427 --> 01:22:55,762
It's disgusting.

739
01:22:57,597 --> 01:22:58,573
Actually...

740
01:23:00,166 --> 01:23:01,284
...it scares me.

741
01:23:01,585 --> 01:23:02,978
Because it affects...

742
01:23:03,003 --> 01:23:04,454
...you directly.

743
01:23:09,285 --> 01:23:10,276
It's Santana...

744
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:13,238
...anything new on the girl?

745
01:23:14,464 --> 01:23:15,456
Fine.

746
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:19,703
What? What fucking radio?

747
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:22,872
Turn on the radio,
someone's saying something.

748
01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:26,418
Call if anything comes up.

749
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:32,007
<i>When I checked her she was ill.</i>

750
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:34,801
<i>Had a lacerated uterus,</i>
<i>loss of blood.</i>

751
01:23:35,035 --> 01:23:38,805
<i>Clearly she was raped,</i>
<i>brutally raped.</i>

752
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:41,474
<i>I advised her to go</i>
<i>to the hospital...</i>

753
01:23:41,641 --> 01:23:44,644
<i>...to report it, so they</i>
<i>would be punished...</i>

754
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:45,854
<i>...she paid no attention.</i>

755
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:48,398
<i>- The girl's ill.</i>
- Fucking bad luck!

756
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:50,817
<i>With no treatment, she'll die.</i>

757
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:08,668
We can drop the whole thing!

758
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:11,337
Our friendship's more important.

759
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:23,016
Come on, Marcos.

760
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:26,770
She's not well, Juan.

761
01:24:27,687 --> 01:24:31,733
I think she hit her head...
You never know.

762
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,694
Take her to the village doctor.

763
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:37,906
Otherwise, I'll keep worrying.

764
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:40,283
I'd like to know who she is...

765
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:43,787
...a woman doesn't walk around
with this sort of rifle.

766
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:47,040
It's very fishy.

767
01:24:58,843 --> 01:25:00,095
Feeling better?

768
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:07,727
Need something?

769
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:09,312
No, thank you.

770
01:25:09,879 --> 01:25:11,331
Why the rifle?

771
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:15,443
- Want a doctor?
- It's nothing.

772
01:25:15,568 --> 01:25:16,861
You should see a doctor.

773
01:25:16,986 --> 01:25:18,171
I said it's nothing!

774
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:19,906
Sorry...

775
01:25:20,323 --> 01:25:21,533
...forgive me.

776
01:25:37,257 --> 01:25:39,801
<i>Once again violence</i>
<i>has brought mourning...</i>

777
01:25:39,926 --> 01:25:42,011

Please help me.

791
01:27:17,982 --> 01:27:19,400
They found you.

792

What d'you want?

793
01:27:23,529 --> 01:27:24,906
There's nothing valuable.

794
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:28,359
Good lord...

795
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:29,619

796
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:51,432
Coming?

797
01:28:14,872 --> 01:28:15,915
They found her.

798
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:47,215
Attention! Attention!

799
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:48,883
You're surrounded!

800

You have no escape!

801
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:55,890
Give yourself up immediately!

802
01:30:07,026 --> 01:30:08,903
What are you doing?
She's crazy!

803
01:30:08,996 --> 01:30:09,703
Why us?

804
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:10,696
Shut up!

805
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:20,699
No, Juan...

806
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:21,499
...don't do it!

807
01:30:27,046 --> 01:30:28,089

Out!

810
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:40,726
Get out!

811
01:30:42,779 --> 01:30:44,355

812
01:30:45,606 --> 01:30:46,691
...it's better.

813
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,568

Out!

815
01:30:51,028 --> 01:30:52,530
Go, tell them we're OK.

816
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:55,741
They should leave.

817

They're hopefully alive.

01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:46,292
I know this woman.

834
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:48,503
I could talk to her.

835
01:31:48,618 --> 01:31:49,703
- Know her?
- Yes.

836
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:50,796
Come with me.

837
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,474
Wait here.

838
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:07,480
Excuse me, Captain.

839
01:32:08,147 --> 01:32:09,815
Someone knows the Italian.

840
01:32:10,116 --> 01:32:10,991
This guy?

841
01:32:11,516 --> 01:32:12,391
Yes.

842
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:20,284
Evening.

843
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:21,285
Can I help you?

844
01:32:21,494 --> 01:32:22,745
I know this woman.

845
01:32:23,037 --> 01:32:23,871
You know her?

846
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:25,831
I went out with her.

847
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:28,000
You're this bitch's friend?

848
01:32:31,455 --> 01:32:32,396
Listen...

849
01:32:32,755 --> 01:32:36,092
...it would be sensible
to speak to her.

850
01:32:37,134 --> 01:32:38,511
I'll do it, I know her.

851
01:32:39,178 --> 01:32:40,846
I could convince her.

852
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:42,890
Let me speak to her.

853
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:47,353
Do your job reporting
and let us do our job.

854
01:32:49,947 --> 01:32:51,040
Thanks.

855
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:56,362
The house is surrounded!

856
01:32:56,904 --> 01:33:00,866
Free the hostages
and give yourself up!

857
01:33:01,367 --> 01:33:03,536
Come out with your hands up!

858
01:33:05,329 --> 01:33:09,125
You have no way out!
Give yourself up!

859
01:33:10,376 --> 01:33:13,504
It's your last warning,
you're surrounded!

860
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:18,050
Come out or we'll come in.
You have 15 seconds.

861
01:33:23,514 --> 01:33:24,724
What will you do?

862
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:29,870
Don't know...

863
01:33:32,189 --> 01:33:34,233
I just want to be left in peace.

864
01:33:42,989 --> 01:33:44,233
And us?

865
01:33:46,662 --> 01:33:48,706
Why not let Alberto go?

866
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:52,710
I'll stay with you.

867
01:33:54,679 --> 01:33:55,855
I can't.

868
01:34:00,593 --> 01:34:01,802
Let him go...

869
01:34:02,053 --> 01:34:03,387
I want to stay with her.

870
01:34:03,804 --> 01:34:05,097
You keep quiet.

871
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:34,293
Aren't you sleepy?

872
01:34:34,418 --> 01:34:36,462
No. Mom says I sleep little.

873
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:41,967
Do you ride horseback?

874
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,636
Yes, but I'm afraid.

875
01:34:45,471 --> 01:34:47,139
I have 2 horses.

876
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:51,727
One's called Laura,
the other Claudio.

877
01:35:00,903 --> 01:35:02,405
What do you want to
be in life?

878
01:35:02,613 --> 01:35:05,074
Football player, to play
like Stoicof...

879
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:08,577
...like Stoicof.

880
01:35:08,786 --> 01:35:09,704
Who's that?

881
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:11,122
You never saw him?

882
01:35:11,247 --> 01:35:12,331
How can you not know him?

883
01:35:12,498 --> 01:35:15,835
He's a forward for Barcelona.

884
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:18,671
I'm on the school team.

885
01:35:18,838 --> 01:35:20,423
I play defense,
but I prefer forward.

886
01:35:23,509 --> 01:35:24,719
Enough!

887
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:26,262
Enough!

888
01:35:27,304 --> 01:35:29,849
Enough, please, enough.

889
01:36:06,510 --> 01:36:07,887
I can't bear this waiting.

890
01:36:12,475 --> 01:36:15,853
With your help,
I could get to the house.

891
01:36:16,504 --> 01:36:17,897
I could go in.

892
01:36:18,814 --> 01:36:21,025
Try to do something.

893
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:23,569
There's not much you can do.

894
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:27,698
We can just wait.

895
01:36:29,325 --> 01:36:30,910
They won't do anything
'till morning.

896
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:36,332
There's a woman and 2 kids
in there. It's all over the news.

897
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:43,839
The girl should give herself up.

898
01:36:47,426 --> 01:36:49,011
I read her diary and...

899
01:36:50,429 --> 01:36:51,722
She doesn't write anything...

900
01:36:53,766 --> 01:36:54,850
She's sensitive...

901
01:36:59,438 --> 01:37:00,981
You're taken by her.

902
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:04,443
What happened was wonderful.

903
01:37:05,736 --> 01:37:07,613
You're putting her on a pedestal.

904
01:37:08,531 --> 01:37:12,451
This fucking girl killed
4 people and wounded one.

905
01:37:12,618 --> 01:37:14,119
Where's the Italian's friend?

906
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:19,291
Come with me.

907
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:22,002
You know her and
don't mention it?

908
01:37:22,103 --> 01:37:22,828
What an asshole!

909
01:37:23,045 --> 01:37:24,088
Mute as a mummy!

910
01:37:24,213 --> 01:37:25,589
You're the asshole!

911
01:37:25,881 --> 01:37:30,135
This is personal, and I have
no explanations to give.

912
01:37:30,302 --> 01:37:31,762
- Know, what?
- No, what?

913
01:37:31,887 --> 01:37:34,265
- You're unprofessional.
- You're professional?

914
01:37:34,515 --> 01:37:35,891
Vulture!

915
01:37:38,894 --> 01:37:40,229
Ball buster!

916
01:38:58,040 --> 01:38:59,216
It's me, Marcos!

917
01:39:02,311 --> 01:39:03,437
I'm coming in.

918
01:39:05,022 --> 01:39:06,315
I have to talk to you!

919
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:26,251
I'm coming in!

920
01:39:27,294 --> 01:39:28,837
I need to talk to you!

921
01:40:10,629 --> 01:40:11,714
Hi, reporter.

922
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:17,136
I told you
I'd follow you to hell.

923
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:19,722
Here I am.

924
01:40:27,229 --> 01:40:28,313
How are you holding up?

925
01:40:31,108 --> 01:40:34,194
Well... I'm well.

926
01:40:36,055 --> 01:40:37,448
I needed to see you.

927
01:40:40,242 --> 01:40:42,202
We haven't finished
our interview.

928
01:40:58,786 --> 01:40:59,928
Let them go.

929
01:41:01,956 --> 01:41:03,265
I'll stay with you.

930
01:41:18,222 --> 01:41:19,364
Get out.

931
01:41:21,575 --> 01:41:22,659
We can go?

932
01:41:23,243 --> 01:41:24,469
Yes, get out of here.

933
01:41:26,914 --> 01:41:29,792
Alberto, son, wake up,
we're going.

934
01:41:39,451 --> 01:41:40,594
Come on, son.

935
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:07,121
I can't stand it.

936
01:42:09,289 --> 01:42:10,624
I'm tired.

937
01:42:10,742 --> 01:42:11,883
Wait.

938
01:42:12,776 --> 01:42:13,502
Don't say that.

939
01:42:13,669 --> 01:42:16,463
I want to die!

940
01:42:16,755 --> 01:42:20,217
No, you don't, I'm here now,
calm down.

941
01:42:20,685 --> 01:42:21,944
I want to die.

942
01:42:29,769 --> 01:42:31,603
Wait, wait, wait.

943
01:42:33,522 --> 01:42:37,109
- I want to die.
- No, we'll make it...

944
01:42:38,277 --> 01:42:40,445
...you and I!
We'll make it!

945
01:42:47,619 --> 01:42:51,290
I'll take care of everything.
Just think about getting better.

946
01:42:58,672 --> 01:42:59,673
Can you get up?

947
01:43:11,343 --> 01:43:17,774
I'm sleepy.

948
01:43:20,027 --> 01:43:22,446
Listen, listen...

949
01:43:22,654 --> 01:43:23,739
Listen to me...

950
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:26,783
...we'll go outside.

951
01:43:27,826 --> 01:43:28,869
You'll get treatment.

952
01:43:30,662 --> 01:43:34,458
We'll get a lawyer. No!
We'll get the best lawyer.

953
01:43:34,583 --> 01:43:36,168
You have mitigating
circumstances.

954
01:43:36,293 --> 01:43:37,753
We'll mobilize the press.

955
01:43:43,675 --> 01:43:46,803
They can't give you many years.
They can't!

956
01:43:50,933 --> 01:43:53,936
And I'll wait for you.
I'll always be with you.
