THEY'VE CHANGED FACES

3
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:17,395
Auto Avio Motors.
10th Floor. Projects Dept.

4
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,133
9AM, meeting with designers.

5
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,652
10AM, meeting with
the Soviet representatives

6
00:02:40,652 --> 00:02:43,334
concerning the modifications
to the 1004 model.

7
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:46,626
1PM, report to Engineer Arche.

8
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,996
Valle, this is Arche.
Come at once.

9
00:02:58,844 --> 00:03:01,194
15th Floor.
General Management.

10
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:09,182
Good morning.

11
00:03:10,245 --> 00:03:13,269
Ah, it's you, Valle.
Thank God you're here.

12
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:15,047
They want you upstairs.

13
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:17,190
- Me?
- Yes. You.

14
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:20,961
- Upstairs?
- The VP.

15
00:03:21,182 --> 00:03:23,867
- I have a meeting with designers
in half an hour.

16
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:26,250
- I have already cancelled. Go.

17
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:29,872
- To the 19th?
-Looks like you've arrived.

18
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:38,280
19th Floor.
Office of the Vice President.

19
00:03:41,944 --> 00:03:43,551
- Yes?

20
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:45,860
- Dr. Alberto Valle.

21
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,274
- Come with me.

22
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,158
20th Floor.
CEO.

23
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,685
Come in.

24
00:04:14,991 --> 00:04:19,133
Welcome, Dr. Valle.
Thank you, Felsi, you can go.

25
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:35,733
- Pour yourself a drink.
- Thank you.

26
00:04:59,327 --> 00:05:05,219
I am glad to meet you.
I don't think we've met before.

27
00:05:06,705 --> 00:05:08,690
- I am mostly dowstairs.

28
00:05:09,825 --> 00:05:11,180
- Please.

29
00:05:13,973 --> 00:05:17,238
Exactly. You were at 10th.

30
00:05:17,702 --> 00:05:22,430
Can you go at once?
- Yes. Of course.

31
00:05:23,102 --> 00:05:29,119
- The owner of A.A.M.
would like to see you

32
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:31,194
at his villa
in the mountains.

33
00:05:31,194 --> 00:05:33,924
- The owner? But aren't you...?

34
00:05:33,924 --> 00:05:38,434
- I am just the CEO. The owner...

35
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:42,614
is Engineer Giovanni Nosferatu.

36
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,396
Excuse me. Is there
a gas station nearby?

37
00:08:11,235 --> 00:08:12,635
Hello.

38
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:16,039
My car's running out of gas.

39
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,161
Is there a gas station
here somewhere?

40
00:08:26,535 --> 00:08:28,938
Motor. Gasoline.

41
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:32,870
Hey, white man.

42
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,849
I'll lead you to gasoline
if you give me a lift.

43
00:08:39,922 --> 00:08:42,759
Tarzan carries Jane
to his iron horse.

44
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,913
Jane has tired feet.

45
00:08:54,106 --> 00:08:55,957
Where have you popped up from?

46
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:58,065
I'm coming from there
and I'm going that way.

47
00:08:58,065 --> 00:08:59,560
Get in, let's go.

48
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:02,717
Hold on a moment.

49
00:09:02,717 --> 00:09:05,025
To begin with, who are you?

50
00:09:09,952 --> 00:09:12,574
OK, I get it.
Jane travels on foot.

51
00:09:18,796 --> 00:09:21,838
Rule 17, never pick up
hitch-hikers who have

52
00:09:21,838 --> 00:09:24,601
no written permission
from parents.

53
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:34,959
All right, Jane, get in.
I need gas.

54
00:09:35,305 --> 00:09:37,750
2km straight ahead
there's a gas station.

55
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,857
A deal's a deal.
Get in.

56
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,867
- Aren't you cold?
- Perhaps.

57
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:04,808
I'm lucky to have run into you.
Very few cars take this road.

58
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,596
- Where are you going?

59
00:10:07,143 --> 00:10:08,764
- I told you.
I'm going there.

60
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:10,449
- There, where?

61
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,571
- What does it matter?

62
00:10:14,168 --> 00:10:16,002
- You're a strange girl.

63
00:11:16,703 --> 00:11:17,903
Full tank, please.

64
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:26,996
Is it always this foggy
in these parts?

65
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,330
Could you show me the way
to the Villa Nosferatu?

66
00:11:59,148 --> 00:12:01,021
They are not very talkative here.

67
00:12:02,395 --> 00:12:06,044
I think he only talks
if you want your oil changed.

68
00:12:07,766 --> 00:12:09,783
- And then?
- And then nothing.

69
00:12:11,054 --> 00:12:14,298
No, wait. Here's a strange sign.

70
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:17,434
Something I don't understand.
- Good or bad?

71
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:23,659
- No, just important.
You must be a CEO.

72
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,484
- No, I'm just an employee.
I work in an office.

73
00:12:28,484 --> 00:12:31,833
- An office? One of those places
where all rooms are

74
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,550
the same and all people
do exactly the same thing?

75
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:37,034
- Something like that.

76
00:12:37,995 --> 00:12:41,161
- And what do you make?
- Cars. Planes.

77
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:42,847
- What's your name?

78
00:12:45,469 --> 00:12:48,152
- Alberto Valle. And yours?

79
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,449
- Laura.

80
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,601
I swear, when I saw you like that,
among those shacks...

81
00:13:00,601 --> 00:13:03,678
- Because you're a bourgeois.
I needed a lift, so...

82
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,140
- It was so convincing,
it could be dangerous.

83
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,482
- No need to take it so seriously.
I always do that.

84
00:13:11,505 --> 00:13:14,327
Engineer G. Nosferatu.

85
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,776
The place you were asking about
at the gas station? - Yes.

86
00:13:25,219 --> 00:13:28,118
- He can't be a very cheerful guy.
- Why?

87
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,973
- It's cold here.

88
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:38,853
The birds don't sing.

89
00:13:45,234 --> 00:13:48,121
If he's so dreary,
why go see him at all?

90
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:49,647
- Because he told me to.

91
00:13:49,647 --> 00:13:51,664
- And you couldn't disobey?

92
00:13:57,994 --> 00:13:59,912
I don't think he's expecting you.

93
00:13:59,912 --> 00:14:02,221
- Yes, he expects me,
and no, I can't disobey.

94
00:14:14,404 --> 00:14:16,401
- You're going?
- Of course.

95
00:14:20,645 --> 00:14:23,280
- Wouldn't you like to go with me?

96
00:14:24,842 --> 00:14:26,573
- But where?

97
00:14:26,883 --> 00:14:28,836
- What does it matter?

98
00:14:33,284 --> 00:14:34,871
Pity.

99
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,470
Bye.

100
00:14:58,128 --> 00:14:59,345
Alberto.

101
00:15:04,352 --> 00:15:06,082
Are you happy?

102
00:15:10,298 --> 00:15:12,813
Would you like to make love to me?

103
00:15:14,274 --> 00:15:16,789
- Not now. I can't.

104
00:15:18,343 --> 00:15:19,422
- Alberto.

105
00:15:23,528 --> 00:15:25,132
I'll wait for you.

106
00:15:26,597 --> 00:15:30,497
- When you're tired of waiting,
leave them on the dashboard.

107
00:15:49,201 --> 00:15:53,058
I am Dr. Valle,
Sr. Nosferatu is expecting me.

108
00:17:42,198 --> 00:17:43,480
Dr. Valle?

109
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,136
I am Engineer Nosferatu's secretary.

110
00:17:55,489 --> 00:17:57,155
My name is Corinna.

111
00:18:03,988 --> 00:18:05,598
You wanted to leave?

112
00:18:07,138 --> 00:18:08,997
- No. Thank you.

113
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,514
I just wanted to park the car.

114
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,770
- Don't worry.

115
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:22,244
Even outside the gate,
your car is completely safe.

116
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:25,832
No one ever approaches
the boundary wall.

117
00:18:25,832 --> 00:18:27,551
- Why?

118
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,102
The cigarettes are on the table,
so are the drinks.

119
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:37,771
Now if you'll excuse me,
I must announce your arrival.

120
00:19:04,657 --> 00:19:07,092
When you are tired,
nothing can be better than

121
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:09,107
an armchair of
pressurized plastic.

122
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,899
"Plastic Comfort".

123
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,582
Because it's soft.

124
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:14,298
It envelops and caresses you...

125
00:19:18,997 --> 00:19:22,668
"Plastic Comfort" furniture
costs less and lasts longer.

126
00:19:22,668 --> 00:19:24,751
Yes, because woodworms gather
on top of it and

127
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:27,174
fall to the floor,
killing themselves.

128
00:19:27,473 --> 00:19:30,511
Remember:
"Plastic Comfort",

129
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:34,506
plastics that are not plastics.

130
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:22,506
Need a light?

131
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:31,149
Thank you.

132
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:36,636
The Engineer asked me to
be your hostess.

133
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:39,123
If you folllow me,
I'll show you your room.

134
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:41,099
- When can I see him?

135
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:43,002
- Not before supper.

136
00:20:43,002 --> 00:20:46,092
By day he stays in his office,
and no one can see him.

137
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:29,822
Supper will be at 10 sharp.

138
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:31,893
Can I do anything more for you?

139
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:35,251
- Nothing that lies within
a secretary's competence.

140
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:40,347
- A secretary's duties
are highly stretchable.

141
00:21:42,315 --> 00:21:43,351
See you later.

142
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:39,824
A shower is not a shower

143
00:22:39,824 --> 00:22:43,406
if your water supply system
does not contain the additive

144
00:22:43,406 --> 00:22:45,450
of A-Uno Tonic.

145
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,615
With A-Uno you're younger,

146
00:22:47,615 --> 00:22:49,193
stronger.

147
00:22:49,424 --> 00:22:53,187
With A-Uno life and love
give more pleasure.

148
00:22:54,324 --> 00:22:57,338
A-Uno Tonic,

149
00:22:57,338 --> 00:22:59,399
a caress on your skin.

150
00:23:00,365 --> 00:23:05,139
I want to feel on my body
the caress of A-Uno.

151
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:09,444
Give yourself to it

152
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:13,073
without shame,
young and naked.

153
00:23:13,344 --> 00:23:15,820
I am young, and I am...

154
00:23:33,797 --> 00:23:35,356
Good evening, Corinna.

155
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,823
Is Engineer Nosferatu
joining us?

156
00:23:39,462 --> 00:23:42,180
Good evening, Dr. Valle.

157
00:24:06,701 --> 00:24:09,740
Welcome to my house.

158
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,569
- Thank you.

159
00:24:14,894 --> 00:24:17,123
I hope you had a good journey.

160
00:24:18,007 --> 00:24:21,283
Although you may have had some
difficulty in finding the villa?

161
00:24:21,741 --> 00:24:22,782
- In fact, yes.

162
00:24:23,123 --> 00:24:25,329
- The people here
are not very talkative.

163
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:31,742
But that sometimes yields
pleasant surprises.

164
00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:35,948
Please.

165
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:40,087
Don't worry,
no advertising this time.

166
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,843
I try out the advertising slogans

167
00:24:43,843 --> 00:24:46,399
on the internal circuit.

168
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,237
It is an interesting test market.

169
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:53,668
- I'm sure.
I used to be in advertising.

170
00:24:53,889 --> 00:24:55,188
- I know.

171
00:24:56,214 --> 00:25:01,189
From December 1960 to March 1963.

172
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:04,620
- You are very well informed.

173
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:07,571
- But I am sure that
your present career

174
00:25:08,388 --> 00:25:10,925
gives you more satisfaction.

175
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:21,521
Hold it!

176
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,201
This is the fruit, Dr. Valle.

177
00:25:26,032 --> 00:25:27,490
I beg your pardon.

178
00:25:30,206 --> 00:25:32,959
First course is yellow.
Second course red.

179
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:36,229
Fruit is orange,
the dessert is chestnut.

180
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,881
- Thank you.

181
00:25:38,634 --> 00:25:40,878
In each container is
a nourishing substance

182
00:25:40,878 --> 00:25:42,956
with an abundance of
all necessary nutrients.

183
00:25:43,422 --> 00:25:47,323
And no danger of
indigestion or ulcers?

184
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,346
Those come in
special containers.

185
00:25:50,346 --> 00:25:52,535
Exactly like the others.

186
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,434
I have created
the first example

187
00:25:55,434 --> 00:25:57,663
of gastronomic socialism.

188
00:25:59,442 --> 00:26:01,128
I am sure you
will appreciate that.

189
00:26:01,877 --> 00:26:04,764
- May I know what I am
eating? - Of course.

190
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:08,255
Those are veal medallions
in Madeira sauce.

191
00:26:10,173 --> 00:26:15,011
- I think the original taste
could be chemically preserved.

192
00:26:15,011 --> 00:26:17,526
- I eliminated it on purpose.

193
00:26:17,884 --> 00:26:20,377
As Freud pointed out in his time,

194
00:26:20,377 --> 00:26:22,842
the gustatory or olfactory stimuli,

195
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:26,419
just like the sexual ones,

196
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:30,663
lead only to pleasure
for its own sake,

197
00:26:30,663 --> 00:26:34,229
and result in a
waste of energy.

198
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:36,118
- But one cannot
evaluate pleasure

199
00:26:36,118 --> 00:26:38,254
in terms of productivity.

200
00:26:38,628 --> 00:26:40,676
- Why not?

201
00:26:40,676 --> 00:26:44,542
Productive energy is too precious
to risk wasting it.

202
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:49,039
Excuse me, Dr. Valle.

203
00:26:49,644 --> 00:26:52,357
I have some urgent
business to attend to.

204
00:26:52,357 --> 00:26:54,015
But we shall meet again later.

205
00:26:54,261 --> 00:26:56,851
The night is long.

206
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,092
If you want to stretch your legs,

207
00:27:01,092 --> 00:27:02,878
I'll show you the park.

208
00:27:06,007 --> 00:27:07,520
It's a good idea.

209
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,889
When you return,
we'll talk of important things.

210
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:22,861
- You don't like
the night, Dr. Valle?

211
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:26,209
- On the contrary.
Particularly in your company.

212
00:27:27,537 --> 00:27:30,218
I was thinking about
Engineer Nosferatu.

213
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:34,073
He is a very strange man.

214
00:27:34,479 --> 00:27:36,246
- Like all talented people.

215
00:27:36,246 --> 00:27:38,084
- No, it's not that.

216
00:27:38,084 --> 00:27:39,937
For years I've been
working for him,

217
00:27:39,937 --> 00:27:42,276
and I did not even
know he existed.

218
00:27:42,607 --> 00:27:44,918
While he, it seems,
knows all about me.

219
00:27:45,553 --> 00:27:47,740
- He likes to make an impression.

220
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,014
But he loves people.
He lives for people.

221
00:27:51,777 --> 00:27:55,295
- Corinna. Do you know
why he invited me here?

222
00:27:55,525 --> 00:27:58,471
- No. He'll tell you
himself before long.

223
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:04,547
- What a strange place.

224
00:28:04,547 --> 00:28:05,711
Looks like a lake.

225
00:28:05,711 --> 00:28:07,133
- It IS a lake.

226
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:10,439
Now it's dry, but in spring
melting snow fills it.

227
00:28:11,636 --> 00:28:15,288
Careful!
This ground can be treacherous.

228
00:28:19,219 --> 00:28:24,647
- Strange. The villa is so modern,
and the park so ancient.

229
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:29,139
- We do not differentiate
between the present and the past.

230
00:28:30,655 --> 00:28:34,427
- True.
This place seems timeless.

231
00:28:35,023 --> 00:28:37,146
It wants to be timeless.

232
00:29:04,657 --> 00:29:05,728
What's that?

233
00:29:07,575 --> 00:29:09,582
- I wouldn't go there,
Dr. Valle.

234
00:29:10,863 --> 00:29:12,016
- Why?

235
00:29:12,812 --> 00:29:14,621
- It can be dangerous.

236
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,835
- But there is something there.

237
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,955
- Just a log.

238
00:29:31,393 --> 00:29:32,859
Let's go back, I'm cold.

239
00:29:48,976 --> 00:29:50,719
- What are these cars
doing here?

240
00:29:51,845 --> 00:29:53,668
- They're guards.
It's almost impossible

241
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:55,586
to cover the park on foot.

242
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:58,597
Please let's go back.

243
00:29:59,674 --> 00:30:01,711
- When I arrived,
I asked the drivers a question.

244
00:30:02,143 --> 00:30:03,500
But they didn't reply.

245
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:05,774
- Naturally. They are
not here to talk.

246
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:16,477
Good night, Dr. Valle.

247
00:30:26,428 --> 00:30:29,221
Did you like the park,
Dr. Valle?

248
00:30:31,548 --> 00:30:33,108
Come on in.

249
00:30:33,512 --> 00:30:36,622
The time has come
to talk of your career.

250
00:30:42,804 --> 00:30:46,670
Would you like to be
CEO of Auto Avio Motors?

251
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:54,045
I must have misheard you.

252
00:30:54,718 --> 00:30:56,746
You heard me very well.

253
00:30:57,371 --> 00:31:03,499
I asked if you would like
to be CEO of A.A.M.

254
00:31:07,042 --> 00:31:10,163
Myths do not die,
they get transformed.

255
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:14,374
For ages, men looked for
the philosophers' stone,

256
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:17,683
capable of transmuting
base metal into gold.

257
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,892
I offer you a part
in a transformation

258
00:31:21,892 --> 00:31:24,235
no less awe-inspiring.

259
00:31:24,235 --> 00:31:27,649
To convert slavery into freedom,

260
00:31:27,649 --> 00:31:30,704
poverty into wealth.

261
00:31:31,064 --> 00:31:34,282
For that,
our philosophers' stone

262
00:31:34,282 --> 00:31:36,477
is technology.

263
00:31:42,956 --> 00:31:45,139
We do not choose power.

264
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:46,804
It chooses us.

265
00:31:48,068 --> 00:31:50,722
That's how it happened
even with me.

266
00:31:54,184 --> 00:31:58,068
Our company needs men
who can command.

267
00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:00,650
Give advice.

268
00:32:01,265 --> 00:32:04,965
People have no idea
what to eat, what to read,

269
00:32:05,181 --> 00:32:06,730
where to go on holiday,

270
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,801
for which party to vote.

271
00:32:09,238 --> 00:32:12,720
I help them understand
their true needs,

272
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,196
their true desires.

273
00:32:15,589 --> 00:32:17,383
And I fulfill them.

274
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:21,019
All of them.

275
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:25,090
You are thinking that
this subject is irrelevant

276
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:27,458
to the proposal
that I've made you.

277
00:32:27,857 --> 00:32:29,517
But it is not.

278
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:33,002
I do not just own
certain factories,

279
00:32:33,002 --> 00:32:35,883
farms, department stores.

280
00:32:37,379 --> 00:32:40,703
I also own newspapers,
political parties,

281
00:32:40,703 --> 00:32:44,048
opposition groups, banks.

282
00:32:45,866 --> 00:32:51,141
Their executives work
under my control, Dr. Valle.

283
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:55,251
And I offer you to
become one of them.

284
00:32:56,818 --> 00:32:58,363
- Why me?

285
00:32:58,801 --> 00:33:01,749
- You fill all the
necessary requirements.

286
00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:03,905
After you understand
certain things,

287
00:33:03,905 --> 00:33:05,833
you'll be a perfect leader.

288
00:33:06,896 --> 00:33:08,611
Can you shoot?

289
00:33:08,898 --> 00:33:09,908
- A bit.

290
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,636
You are free to decide
whenever you like.

291
00:33:52,917 --> 00:33:56,662
In the meantime, please
consider yourself my guest.

292
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:58,129
Thank you.

293
00:35:49,971 --> 00:35:52,984
True civilisation is based
on constant repression

294
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,197
of human instincts.

295
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:59,610
Management of secret aversions.

296
00:36:00,016 --> 00:36:04,234
How to cultivate optimism.

297
00:36:04,653 --> 00:36:08,377
Your secret needs.

298
00:36:08,897 --> 00:36:12,829
Men have the duty to work
and be grateful.

299
00:36:13,107 --> 00:36:15,929
Advertising and sex.

300
00:36:16,894 --> 00:36:21,404
Alice in Consumerland.

301
00:36:21,404 --> 00:36:25,193
Sale of indulgences.

302
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:31,545
Today's children are
tomorrow's specialised consumers.

303
00:36:31,545 --> 00:36:34,831
Back to the cradle.

304
00:36:34,831 --> 00:36:39,636
Psycho-seduction of children.

305
00:36:39,636 --> 00:36:44,598
Recruitment of new consumers.

306
00:37:51,405 --> 00:37:52,996
VALAN, GIULIA
FILM CRITIC

307
00:38:00,232 --> 00:38:02,338
VALLDOLIT, ENRICA
WRITER

308
00:38:27,534 --> 00:38:31,072
VALLE, ALBERTO
CEO, A.A.M.

309
00:39:03,492 --> 00:39:05,363
I saw the open door
and came in to see

310
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:07,662
if you needed anything.

311
00:39:09,327 --> 00:39:10,497
- No.

312
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,978
- You seem distressed.

313
00:39:14,678 --> 00:39:17,040
You should try and get some sleep.

314
00:39:17,392 --> 00:39:19,653
I'd better leave you.
- No!

315
00:39:21,571 --> 00:39:23,656
Let's have a cigarette.

316
00:39:24,936 --> 00:39:27,374
I need to rearrange
my thoughts.

317
00:39:30,614 --> 00:39:32,946
I do not understand
so many things.

318
00:39:32,946 --> 00:39:34,753
- But what happened?

319
00:39:37,323 --> 00:39:39,756
- I saw monstrous things.

320
00:39:40,287 --> 00:39:41,817
- What?

321
00:39:43,874 --> 00:39:45,392
- The babies.

322
00:39:45,766 --> 00:39:48,201
- That's all?
I don't like babies, either.

323
00:39:49,397 --> 00:39:51,675
But don't you think
you exaggerate?

324
00:39:53,081 --> 00:39:55,841
They are children
of some employees.

325
00:39:56,698 --> 00:39:58,370
It was very kind of
Engineer Nosferatu

326
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,243
to take them in.

327
00:40:00,888 --> 00:40:04,037
Mountain air is particularly
healthy for children.

328
00:40:04,037 --> 00:40:05,754
Didn't you know?

329
00:40:13,888 --> 00:40:15,977
But you are sweating.

330
00:40:18,109 --> 00:40:19,794
- I'll take a shower.

331
00:40:19,996 --> 00:40:21,856
- Good night, then.
- Wait!

332
00:40:25,113 --> 00:40:26,628
Where are you going?

333
00:40:27,126 --> 00:40:29,093
- To bed, naturally.

334
00:40:31,545 --> 00:40:33,493
- Don't go.

335
00:40:43,102 --> 00:40:45,034
A shower is not a shower

336
00:40:45,034 --> 00:40:48,628
if your water supply system
does not contain the additive

337
00:40:48,937 --> 00:40:51,484
of A-Uno Tonic.

338
00:40:51,733 --> 00:40:53,989
With A-Uno you're younger,

339
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:55,433
stronger.

340
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:59,560
With A-Uno life and love
give more pleasure.

341
00:40:59,763 --> 00:41:02,779
A-Uno Tonic,

342
00:41:02,779 --> 00:41:05,003
a caress on your skin.

343
00:41:05,355 --> 00:41:10,777
I want to feel on my body
the caress of A-Uno.

344
00:41:11,994 --> 00:41:13,945
Give yourself to it

345
00:41:14,226 --> 00:41:17,515
without shame,
young and naked.

346
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:21,603
I am young, and I am also naked.

347
00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:25,323
Then come, come closer.

348
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:28,655
Let's be together
in the caressing embrace

349
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:31,416
of A-Uno Tonic.

350
00:41:33,353 --> 00:41:37,969
On my skin, on your skin...

351
00:41:38,177 --> 00:41:39,625
I love you.

352
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:41,839
So do I.

353
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,752
And both of us love
A-Uno Tonic.

354
00:41:46,522 --> 00:41:51,448
A-Uno Tonic is a product of
United Cosmetic Industries.

355
00:42:05,614 --> 00:42:07,126
Let me go!

356
00:42:09,058 --> 00:42:10,462
Help!

357
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,823
Alberto!

358
00:42:19,977 --> 00:42:22,107
Leave me alone!

359
00:42:29,282 --> 00:42:32,515
- You know something?
- What?

360
00:42:36,978 --> 00:42:39,747
- There's something strange
about this.

361
00:42:40,013 --> 00:42:42,135
- I'm glad you agree.

362
00:42:45,574 --> 00:42:49,469
- I mean... when I kiss you...

363
00:42:51,182 --> 00:42:53,043
when I love you...

364
00:42:53,043 --> 00:42:56,540
I really like it.
Not like with all the others.

365
00:42:59,295 --> 00:43:02,280
- What others?
- Other guests.

366
00:43:04,246 --> 00:43:06,955
- Do you go to bed with
everyone who comes to the villa?

367
00:43:06,955 --> 00:43:09,412
- No, no! Not everyone.

368
00:43:19,171 --> 00:43:23,555
What is it?
Are you mad at me?

369
00:43:25,491 --> 00:43:27,405
Don't be.

370
00:43:36,243 --> 00:43:40,073
Love is a marvellous thing,
but not without its risks.

371
00:43:40,073 --> 00:43:44,194
Only contraceptives from
Nosferatu Pharmaceuticals

372
00:43:44,194 --> 00:43:46,147
insure you from those risks.

373
00:43:46,147 --> 00:43:50,494
Remember:
Face to Face with Nosferatu!

374
00:44:10,258 --> 00:44:12,234
Open the door,
let me out!

375
00:44:14,696 --> 00:44:16,042
Alberto...

376
00:44:16,042 --> 00:44:18,370
Laura...

377
00:45:41,733 --> 00:45:44,259
- Good morning, Alberto!
- Good morning, Corinna!

378
00:45:45,147 --> 00:45:47,035
- Have you slept well?
- Never better.

379
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,865
This mountain air is marvellous.

380
00:45:48,865 --> 00:45:52,250
- Your breakfast is ready.
Do you play golf?

381
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,525
- Not much. Do you have
a golf course?

382
00:45:54,525 --> 00:45:57,303
- Something like that.
One can play by that wood,

383
00:45:57,303 --> 00:45:58,724
beyond the lake.

384
00:45:58,724 --> 00:46:00,785
Can you take the clubs?
They are in the hall.

385
00:46:00,785 --> 00:46:02,345
I'll wait for you
in the field.

386
00:46:54,248 --> 00:46:56,055
- This is not fair.
- What do you mean?

387
00:46:56,055 --> 00:46:59,082
- A perfect secretary
must know how to lose at golf.

388
00:46:59,456 --> 00:47:01,050
- I'll rememeber, Doctor.

389
00:47:19,794 --> 00:47:23,614
- Where has it gone?
- Not here. The spinney, perhaps.

390
00:51:00,367 --> 00:51:02,894
Alberto!

391
00:51:03,552 --> 00:51:05,298
Where are you hiding?

392
00:51:12,024 --> 00:51:14,677
Are we playing golf
or hide-and-seek?

393
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:23,071
I had a look at the crypt.

394
00:51:23,071 --> 00:51:25,753
Well, if you prefer to fool
around underground alone

395
00:51:25,753 --> 00:51:28,479
rather than
in the woods with me...

396
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:31,227
I'm sorry.

397
00:51:40,135 --> 00:51:41,583
Give me one second.

398
00:52:01,395 --> 00:52:02,876
Lost something?

399
00:52:05,203 --> 00:52:06,529
- I hope not.

400
00:52:07,565 --> 00:52:09,339
- You lost your Queen.

401
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:13,084
Can a perfect secretary
win at chess?

402
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:16,684
- I haven't lost yet.

403
00:52:19,444 --> 00:52:22,908
- No. But you're without a Queen.

404
00:52:26,941 --> 00:52:29,556
- I fear that my King
will not last much longer.

405
00:52:30,169 --> 00:52:31,925
Except...

406
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:38,306
- Check and mate.
- Congratulations.

407
00:52:40,583 --> 00:52:42,361
Who taught you
to play like that?

408
00:52:42,631 --> 00:52:44,126
- Engineer Nosferatu.

409
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:47,853
- Should have guessed.

410
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:52,896
He is a very rational man.
Perhaps too much so.

411
00:52:53,363 --> 00:52:55,048
You know what's there
in the basement?

412
00:52:55,048 --> 00:52:57,229
- Of course.
Employee files.

413
00:52:57,608 --> 00:53:00,708
- And two photos
of Dr. Alberto Valle,

414
00:53:01,162 --> 00:53:09,338
and a prediction
of my future as CEO of A.A.M.

415
00:53:10,212 --> 00:53:13,113
That's Auto Avio Motors.

416
00:53:13,113 --> 00:53:15,683
- So what?
It's a flattering prophecy.

417
00:53:15,683 --> 00:53:19,167
- Perhaps for a newborn.
Not for me.

418
00:53:19,528 --> 00:53:22,659
- I think you are slightly crazy.
What's so bad

419
00:53:22,659 --> 00:53:25,642
about wanting to know
everything about one's employees?

420
00:53:25,642 --> 00:53:28,308
Nosferatu loves them.
Is that a vice?

421
00:53:28,851 --> 00:53:32,781
- Nosferatu forsees.
Nosferatu wants to know.

422
00:53:33,407 --> 00:53:35,151
Nosferatu loves.

423
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,907
And the cemetery crypt?

424
00:53:43,248 --> 00:53:44,590
- What about it?

425
00:53:47,117 --> 00:53:48,554
- Nothing.

426
00:53:49,442 --> 00:53:51,252
It's been abandoned for years.

427
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:59,113
How old is Engineer Nosferatu?

428
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,316
- He has no age.

429
00:54:09,463 --> 00:54:12,203
Did you see the lovely village
down in the valley?

430
00:54:12,628 --> 00:54:15,899
Let's go there together?
I love seeing things with you.

431
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:19,331
With your eyes.
Shall we go, Alberto?

432
00:54:20,206 --> 00:54:21,704
I'll be ready in a moment.

433
00:54:58,445 --> 00:55:00,472
HISTORY OF THE POPES.

434
00:55:20,829 --> 00:55:23,082
MANUAL OF EXORCISM.

435
00:56:02,131 --> 00:56:03,367
Alberto.

436
00:56:09,669 --> 00:56:12,136
Not hide-and-seek again.

437
00:56:14,078 --> 00:56:15,564
I am ready, let's go.

438
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,414
I know a shortcut.

439
00:56:31,414 --> 00:56:33,205
- But it's a rocky place.
- Afraid?

440
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:09,896
Have you seen her?

441
00:58:10,536 --> 00:58:12,371
Did she come back?

442
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:36,502
- You are not nice to me.
- Forgive me.

443
00:59:11,403 --> 00:59:15,833
Look, a church.
It's quite beautiful.

444
00:59:16,502 --> 00:59:18,607
Come, I want to see inside.
- No!

445
00:59:20,951 --> 00:59:23,585
I am a bit tired.
I'll wait in the car.

446
00:59:44,938 --> 00:59:46,246
Why did you look at her like that?

447
00:59:46,465 --> 00:59:49,727
- Madonna Santissima!
I know nothing! I saw nothing!

448
00:59:49,727 --> 00:59:53,172
- I won't hurt you!
What is it you haven't seen?

449
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,064
- Leave her alone.

450
00:59:55,412 --> 00:59:57,311
She's very old.

451
00:59:59,715 --> 01:00:02,285
We are humble people here.

452
01:00:02,285 --> 01:00:05,156
We want nothing to do with
those at the villa.

453
01:00:05,798 --> 01:00:08,086
- But who are they?

454
01:00:10,647 --> 01:00:12,739
- The Bible says,

455
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:16,387
'And he did not know
that giants are there,

456
01:00:16,387 --> 01:00:20,837
and that her guests
are in the depths of hell.'

457
01:00:21,503 --> 01:00:23,846
Now please leave.

458
01:00:26,734 --> 01:00:28,631
Get out!

459
01:00:38,619 --> 01:00:42,491
Wasn't a good idea, was it?

460
01:00:44,068 --> 01:00:45,154
No.

461
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:52,422
Good evening, Dr. Valle.

462
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,808
I regret, but I cannot
enjoy your company tonight.

463
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,924
I expect some people
for a business meeting.

464
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:05,901
Supper will be served for you
in your room.

465
01:02:08,706 --> 01:02:09,939
Thank you.

466
01:04:43,378 --> 01:04:48,269
For this reason I think that...
Thank you.

467
01:04:48,269 --> 01:04:50,751
... male sexuality today
should only be glorified

468
01:04:50,751 --> 01:04:53,479
through consistent use
of mass media.

469
01:04:53,479 --> 01:04:56,339
Science fiction has reached
the level of art.

470
01:04:56,339 --> 01:05:01,080
Take Marcuse, for example,
who towers over the rest of us.

471
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:05,056
No, no. I disagree.

472
01:05:05,834 --> 01:05:08,579
We are all slaves.
That's the problem.

473
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:10,857
The truly free cinema is
advertising.

474
01:05:10,857 --> 01:05:12,779
Advertising is truth.

475
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:16,245
The problem of maleness
is of no interest to me.

476
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:19,250
The productivity index
that grows, rises,

477
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:22,603
hardens and becomes engorged -

478
01:05:22,603 --> 01:05:24,682
that's much more interesting.

479
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:27,432
... provoked by
a strong personality.

480
01:05:27,432 --> 01:05:29,736
Otherwise of course
all men are equal.

481
01:05:30,003 --> 01:05:33,384
For instance, take Adolf Hitler...
- Exactly!

482
01:05:34,008 --> 01:05:40,079
Pius XI called Benito Mussolini
a Man of Providence.

483
01:05:46,163 --> 01:05:47,943
Ladies and gentlemen.

484
01:06:22,939 --> 01:06:27,069
Board meeting 022,
Chemical Industry Sector,

485
01:06:27,305 --> 01:06:32,174
Group A, report on the
increase of weekly production.

486
01:06:32,894 --> 01:06:36,356
Pharmaceuticals, 23%.

487
01:06:36,978 --> 01:06:40,722
Contraceptives, 36%.

488
01:06:40,953 --> 01:06:44,341
Chemical weapons group, 125%.

489
01:06:45,137 --> 01:06:49,690
Detergents, 0.09%.

490
01:06:50,345 --> 01:06:51,594
Reason?

491
01:06:52,272 --> 01:06:58,178
Concerns over water pollution.
Especially safety of children.

492
01:06:58,767 --> 01:07:00,175
Remedy?

493
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:03,855
A new biodegradable detergent.
Our chemists...

494
01:07:03,855 --> 01:07:07,567
You have forgotten we have
400,000 tons of unsold stock.

495
01:07:07,775 --> 01:07:11,288
Apart from that, our chemists
have more serious things to do.

496
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:17,052
We shall package the old
detergents in new packaging.

497
01:07:17,385 --> 01:07:20,441
Ladies and gentlemen,
think of a new brand name.

498
01:07:23,465 --> 01:07:25,400
Arranging consensus.

499
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:29,096
How to cultivate optimism.

500
01:07:29,531 --> 01:07:33,027
The consumer will be attacked
when he least expects it:

501
01:07:33,027 --> 01:07:34,651
in the intimacy
of the living-room,

502
01:07:34,651 --> 01:07:36,897
in the kitchen,
in the bedroom.

503
01:07:36,897 --> 01:07:39,704
Narcissism of the masses.

504
01:07:39,704 --> 01:07:42,676
Attack on the subconscious.

505
01:07:42,676 --> 01:07:46,645
The capriciousness of the consumer.

506
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:51,497
The substance we work on
is the human mind.

507
01:07:51,497 --> 01:07:55,117
Symbols of prestige.

508
01:07:55,117 --> 01:07:58,613
The hooks are baited.

509
01:08:04,101 --> 01:08:06,121
Immaculate.

510
01:08:06,121 --> 01:08:07,988
Virgin!

511
01:08:07,988 --> 01:08:10,374
- Cleano! - Gaga!
- Nobiologic! - Candour!

512
01:08:10,374 --> 01:08:12,525
- Chin-chin! - Fresh!
- Biancus Biancus!

513
01:08:12,936 --> 01:08:16,833
No, ladies and gentlemen.
The name must put paid to

514
01:08:16,833 --> 01:08:18,891
all pollution fears.

515
01:08:19,389 --> 01:08:22,749
We'll call it Clean Water.

516
01:08:22,749 --> 01:08:24,806
And the slogan will be,

517
01:08:24,806 --> 01:08:28,660
'The Cradle of Life and Clean Water.'

518
01:08:29,019 --> 01:08:30,286
- Beautiful!
- Pure genius!

519
01:08:30,286 --> 01:08:32,842
- Sublime! - Radical!
- Subliminal! - Divine!

520
01:08:33,345 --> 01:08:34,468
- Bergmanesque!

521
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:36,290
- And the packaging?

522
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:39,656
- 'Clean Water Preserves Life.'

523
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:44,603
There! A phallic container.

524
01:08:46,367 --> 01:08:49,455
- Ignazio? Any objections
on moral grounds?

525
01:08:49,455 --> 01:08:52,434
- On the contrary.
It's in the Bible:

526
01:08:52,434 --> 01:08:55,289
'Breed and multiply.'

527
01:08:55,739 --> 01:09:00,873
- Censorship problems?
- If the Church agrees, none.

528
01:09:03,623 --> 01:09:07,677
Chemical Industry Sector,
Group A. Social life.

529
01:09:07,677 --> 01:09:10,643
In the last 3 weeks,
no disciplinary measures

530
01:09:10,643 --> 01:09:13,117
taken against employees.

531
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:16,114
That is to say,
it wasn't necessary.

532
01:09:16,346 --> 01:09:20,232
Our strict control has turned
discipline into a way of life.

533
01:09:21,406 --> 01:09:22,900
- Really?

534
01:09:23,477 --> 01:09:26,866
Do you know that reading is
prohibited during the break?

535
01:09:27,095 --> 01:09:29,256
- Of course, and I can guarantee...
- Look.

536
01:09:44,025 --> 01:09:45,151
That's not all.

537
01:09:47,253 --> 01:09:49,030
Do you recognize these persons?

538
01:09:51,371 --> 01:09:57,484
- If I am not mistaken,
employees of Nosferatu Contraceptives.

539
01:09:57,911 --> 01:09:59,420
- You are not mistaken.

540
01:10:27,019 --> 01:10:31,027
- But I cannot see...
Only procreation is prohibited

541
01:10:31,027 --> 01:10:33,882
to the employees of Nosferatu,
not copulation.

542
01:10:33,882 --> 01:10:35,663
On the contrary,
I think these photos

543
01:10:35,663 --> 01:10:37,593
will make a fine
advertising campaign.

544
01:10:37,593 --> 01:10:38,813
- And these?

545
01:10:48,486 --> 01:10:51,543
You have not measured up
to your responsibilities.

546
01:10:52,256 --> 01:10:55,486
I ask you to leave
this villa at once.

547
01:11:13,958 --> 01:11:15,454
On foot!

548
01:11:27,872 --> 01:11:31,022
Let the woman have an abortion
and her husband be sterilised.

549
01:11:34,205 --> 01:11:38,282
Chemical Industry Sector,
Group A. Opening new markets.

550
01:11:39,634 --> 01:11:42,369
Report on legalisation of drugs.

551
01:12:51,126 --> 01:12:56,473
I am glad to report that
the opposition of Deputy Santamaria

552
01:12:56,473 --> 01:13:00,169
to the law on the legalisation
of hallucinatory drugs

553
01:13:00,169 --> 01:13:03,545
has been withdrawn.
He no longer objects.

554
01:13:03,884 --> 01:13:07,504
- You had excellent results
in even more difficult cases.

555
01:13:07,504 --> 01:13:13,277
- Well, it wasn't difficult.
Deputy Santamaria has his

556
01:13:13,277 --> 01:13:18,251
soft spots like all the
protectors of public morals.

557
01:13:18,251 --> 01:13:19,860
Pardon me, Your Eminence.

558
01:13:21,115 --> 01:13:22,374
- Is that all?

559
01:13:22,374 --> 01:13:25,594
- No. You have requested
a monthly donation of

560
01:13:25,594 --> 01:13:28,489
500 bottles of LSD for the poor.

561
01:13:28,489 --> 01:13:30,487
- Very well.
- I beg your pardon.

562
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:33,639
- Yes?
- If I may impose,

563
01:13:34,013 --> 01:13:38,694
3 sample advertising spots are ready.
If you could personally choose...

564
01:13:39,117 --> 01:13:41,174
- Let's see them.
- Thank you!

565
01:13:41,768 --> 01:13:45,296
'The screen lacerates itself
in every frame to disseminate

566
01:13:45,527 --> 01:13:51,391
truth to the winds.'
Said by Jean-Luc Godard.

567
01:13:53,419 --> 01:13:56,790
Permanent revolution, in the sense
attributed to it by Marx,

568
01:13:57,069 --> 01:14:02,849
is revolution that is not reconciled
with any form of class domination;

569
01:14:02,849 --> 01:14:06,085
that does not stop at the
democratic phase, but proceeds to

570
01:14:06,336 --> 01:14:11,015
socialist measures and open war
against external reaction;

571
01:14:11,015 --> 01:14:15,091
revolution of which every new phase
is contained, in seminal form,

572
01:14:15,091 --> 01:14:17,369
in the previous phase;

573
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:21,342
revolution that stops only
with the total liquidation...

574
01:14:25,388 --> 01:14:26,677
- No good.

575
01:14:26,677 --> 01:14:31,421
'The essence of the comic
is imbibed with mother's milk.'

01:14:31,421 --> 01:14:34,293

577
01:15:07,955 --> 01:15:10,990
Daddy! Mommy!

578

'Murder, incest, rape will
only be punished among slaves.'

579
01:15:24,576 --> 01:15:27,581
Said by the Marquis de Sade.

580
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:24,591
Enough!
I can't take it any more!

581
01:17:24,591 --> 01:17:27,442
This is boring!
Give me a drink!

582
01:17:28,626 --> 01:17:31,267
- We have just the thing!
- Really? What is it?!

583
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:33,512
- Shall we tell him?
- Yes!

584
01:17:33,512 --> 01:17:35,635
- L-S-D!

585
01:17:35,635 --> 01:17:38,300
- Finally in stores?!
- Of course!

586
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:41,812
Starting today,
in all Nosferatu supermarkets.

587
01:17:41,812 --> 01:17:47,191
We're here!

588
01:17:47,191 --> 01:17:51,170
With L-S-D!

589
01:17:52,057 --> 01:17:56,227
Standard size
and family size bottle.

590
01:17:58,092 --> 01:18:02,883
LSD is a product of
Nosferatu Pharmaceuticals,

591
01:18:02,883 --> 01:18:05,910
a name that we trust.

592
01:18:07,031 --> 01:18:11,076
Starting today, in all
Nosferatu supermarkets.

593
01:18:18,918 --> 01:18:20,134
This is good.

594
01:18:28,681 --> 01:18:31,816
Ignazio? Any objections
on moral grounds?

595
01:18:32,286 --> 01:18:35,684
- No! Just a piece of advice.

596
01:18:35,936 --> 01:18:39,993
When he whips her,
we could see a mirror reflection.

597
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:42,174
That would be very beautiful.

598
01:18:42,174 --> 01:18:43,475
- Excellent idea.

599
01:19:20,629 --> 01:19:23,502
Good night. See you.

600
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:39,474
- Have a good night's work, Engineer.
- Thank you, Corinna.

601
01:20:11,574 --> 01:20:16,131
Please sit down, Dr. Valle.
Have a drink?

602
01:20:20,724 --> 01:20:22,717
Don't you feel ridiculous?

603
01:20:30,857 --> 01:20:33,896
The chemists' meeting upset you.

604
01:20:35,649 --> 01:20:37,827
- You knew I was eavesdropping?

605
01:20:38,218 --> 01:20:41,889
- If you become
part of my organisation,

606
01:20:42,248 --> 01:20:44,604
you have to know it in depth.

607
01:20:45,319 --> 01:20:48,129
- I want nothing to do
with your organisation.

608
01:20:48,129 --> 01:20:49,471
I'm leaving.

609
01:20:50,887 --> 01:20:52,903
- You cannot leave, Dr. Valle.

610
01:20:54,527 --> 01:20:56,019
- No?

611
01:20:56,709 --> 01:20:59,362
You said I was free
to choose what I liked.

612
01:21:00,919 --> 01:21:04,661
WHEN you liked.
Not WHAT you liked.

613
01:21:04,661 --> 01:21:05,987
- Look...

614
01:21:07,567 --> 01:21:11,667
- Don't make me waste
more time, Dr. Valle.

615
01:21:12,436 --> 01:21:14,775
- Are you afraid of time?

616
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:18,506
Or just the dawn, like vampires?

617
01:21:19,835 --> 01:21:24,622
- In the XX Century,
you believe in vampires?

618
01:21:24,830 --> 01:21:27,465
- Myths do not die,
they get transformed.

619
01:21:27,465 --> 01:21:29,240
You told me that yourself.

620
01:21:29,659 --> 01:21:33,888
You've changed faces, but you
go on drinking human blood.

621
01:21:36,765 --> 01:21:38,459
- Finished?
- No.

622
01:21:41,002 --> 01:21:43,030
I'll tell you what I'll do now.

623
01:21:43,262 --> 01:21:45,681
- Drive a stake into my heart?

624
01:21:45,681 --> 01:21:49,582
- I'll go to the newspapers.
To the police.

625
01:21:49,850 --> 01:21:54,698
- Newspapers belong to me.
Police belongs to me.

626
01:21:55,447 --> 01:21:58,086
- Then I will throw bombs
at your factories.

627
01:21:58,086 --> 01:22:00,239
Set fire to your department stores.

628
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:02,594
Smash windows in your supermarkets.

629
01:22:12,066 --> 01:22:13,760
- Feel free.

630
01:24:16,308 --> 01:24:19,032
Back so soon, Dr. Valle?

631
01:24:21,207 --> 01:24:23,047
- Call off your guards.

632
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:27,458
- Don't be silly.
Put down the gun.

633
01:24:28,599 --> 01:24:30,491
- Call off your guards.

634
01:24:31,158 --> 01:24:34,695
- Killing me will solve nothing.

635
01:24:35,147 --> 01:24:36,981
- I'll count to three.

636
01:24:37,317 --> 01:24:42,017
One! - You will become the most
faithful of my assistants.

637
01:24:42,556 --> 01:24:47,394
- Two! - I have great things
in store for you.

638
01:24:47,832 --> 01:24:48,974
- Three!

639
01:25:19,394 --> 01:25:20,871
Alberto!

640
01:25:29,783 --> 01:25:31,074
Why?

641
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:54,037
If you're leaving,
I'll walk you to the gate.

642
01:25:58,190 --> 01:25:59,904
- Please.

643
01:26:04,791 --> 01:26:05,833
Corinna.

644
01:26:11,779 --> 01:26:13,661
I had to do it.

645
01:26:15,721 --> 01:26:17,175
Leave with me.

646
01:27:19,402 --> 01:27:21,257
Laura!

647
01:27:22,787 --> 01:27:23,880
- Hello.

648
01:27:26,607 --> 01:27:27,918
I was waiting for you.

649
01:27:29,279 --> 01:27:30,681
But what are you doing?

650
01:27:31,824 --> 01:27:33,346
- We are leaving together.

651
01:27:33,563 --> 01:27:36,747
- No, I can't.
I returned just to say hello.

652
01:27:39,145 --> 01:27:40,550
- Returned?

653
01:27:40,830 --> 01:27:44,779
- Yes. I found a job as secretary
to a big businessman.

654
01:27:45,196 --> 01:27:49,130
Finally, an ordered life,
perhaps a husband, kids.

655
01:27:49,788 --> 01:27:51,427
Security.
- But...

656
01:27:52,236 --> 01:27:55,120
You wanted to be free!
Travel around the world!

657
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:57,428
See beautiful things!

658
01:27:58,524 --> 01:28:01,672
Didn't you tell me that?
- Yes.

659
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:04,464
I was silly, wasn't I?

660
01:28:04,464 --> 01:28:07,197
But then I realised
that you were right.

661
01:28:17,476 --> 01:28:19,254
Bye. I must run.

662
01:30:29,670 --> 01:30:32,266
Welcome, Dr. Valle.

663
01:30:53,587 --> 01:31:00,798
Today, terror is called technology.
