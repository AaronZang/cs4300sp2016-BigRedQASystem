00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,943

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,283
Why this unease?

4
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:27,520
I just killed a demon, that was all,
same as I used to.

5
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:28,993
So why...?

6
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:40,002
It won't be long now,
not long at all.

7
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,598
The real demon-eater will reawaken.

8
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:44,302
To free Haruka's memories,

9
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:48,541
you've been possessing monsters
with evil spirits to make demons.

10
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,948
We initially thought to use humans.

11
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:55,385
So many of them are already consumed
by earthly desires,

12
00:00:55,455 --> 00:01:00,358
yet none of them possess the spiritual
power necessary to harbor an evil spirit.

13
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:01,951
Such a pity, isn't it?

14
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,696
Raiko Minamoto.

15
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:15,968
A Snowy Landscape of Glass

16
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:46,772
If you listen closely,
you should be able to hear

17
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:53,871
The faint voice calling out to you

18
00:01:53,947 --> 00:02:01,149
Yes, deep within the thick woods
of three thousand worlds

19
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:10,152
Someone is screaming out
to pry open the night

20
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:17,159
Secret world, let's go to help
beyond the veil

21
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:24,302
Close your eyes and fly
towards an invisible world

22
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:31,476
Of the past, of the future

23
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:39,219
Secret world, secret world

24
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:50,495
Muu-chan! Muu-chan!

25
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:52,803
It's so cold.

26
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:56,399
Where could Muu-chan have run off to
so early in the morning?

27
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,354
Demon-eater?

28
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:24,669
Wait just a little longer, OK?
I'll have it for you in a minute.

29
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,899
It's been three days
since he left, huh?

30
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,341
I wonder where Haruka could have gone.

31
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,678
I hope he's taking care of himself,
wherever he is.

32
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:41,083
It's not like monsters catch colds
or anything, so I think he'll be OK.

33
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,952
Still, you can't help but worry
about what he's doing.

34
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:48,084
Ever since Haruka left,
Kantaro hasn't been eating well.

35
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,324
He's just thrown himself into his work.

36
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,935
Oh, Muu-chan. How are ya?

37
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,135
Whatcha think, Reiko?
Not a bad job, huh?

38
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,080
"The Water Imp's Ladle -
Cypress or Cedar?"

39
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,640
It's actually a pretty interesting subject.

40
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,687
Yes, it certainly is interesting, but...

41
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,085
But?

42
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,249
Well, the wording seems a little...

43
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,415
Something wrong?

44
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:59,625
I don't mean to be rude, but this piece has
a substantial amount of grammatical errors,

45
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,167
misspelled and missing words...

46
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,726
Really? OK, now, let's see.

47
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,329
Oh, I see what you're saying.

48
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,671
Yeah, this is strange.

49
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,210
Sorry. Oh, well.
I hadn't even noticed.

50
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,576
I'll make the corrections right away.

51
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,306
Where's my fountain pen?

52
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:21,342
Oh, man.
I could've sworn it was right here.

53
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,718
That's odd.

54
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,313
Hello.

55
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,719
- Right hand.
- Right hand?

56
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,786
Is something wrong with mine?
Oh, I see.

57
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:34,890
What do you know? Case closed.
So it was right in front of me all along.

58
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:39,495
You seem a bit worn out, Mr. Ichinomiya.
Why not take a little break?

59
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:43,508
Yoko told me this is the third day in a row
that you've barely slept.

60
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,874
It's OK, Reiko. It's OK.

61
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:49,506
I'm perfectly fine,
so there's no need for you to worry.

62
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:53,382
It doesn't look like Haruka's
coming back, does it?

63
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,954
I understand how you feel,
but if you just take a little break...

64
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,685
How could you understand?

65
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,326
Sorry about that.
But I'm really all right.

66
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,626
Please don't trouble yourself, OK?

67
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,491
Wait. Where are you going?

68
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,867
I'm just gonna clean up a bit.

69
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,985
You will come back,
won't you, Haruka?

70
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,640
Come on, stay still.

71
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,304
There we go.

72
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,245
Wow. That's great.

73
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,381
What's this,
a young ladies' gossip session?

74
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,441
Kantaro!

75
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,919
Oh, it's a weasel.

76
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:05,754
- Muu-chan brought it here in her mouth.
- It hurt its leg.

77
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,955
Kantaro!

78
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,363
You all right?

79
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,663
Yeah, I'm fine.

80
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:19,296
That's too bad.
I guess it just doesn't like me, huh?

81
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,862
Well, anyway...

82
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,766
Hey, wait a sec.

83
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,875
Oh, no!

84
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,405
So, what is that thing
you keep looking at?

85
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,408
Some kind of vial?

86
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,953
I don't know.

87
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,922
You really enjoy looking at it,
don't you?

88
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,548
It glitters.

89
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,320
When you hold it in the light,
it sparkles.

90
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,294
My memories are returning.

91
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,002
So far just a few, but...

92
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,300
Is that right?
That's good to hear.

93
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,532
I guess.

94
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,133
But aren't you happy about it?

95
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:01,408
Happy? I guess I'm happy.
I should be, right?

96
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,979
Yeah.

97
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:06,951
Well, you're the only one
who can really tell how you feel.

98
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,282
So what is it that's bothering you?

99
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:28,031
- Nothing.
- Really? Nothing, huh?

100
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,380
Where are you going now?

101
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,919
I don't know.

102
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,523
Demon-eater.

103
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:05,872
Just as I thought.

104
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:09,711
It's getting in the way
of the demon-eater's reawakening.

105
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,080
What would you like to do?

106
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:15,416
Depends.
Can I count on your help?

107
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,622
If necessary.

108
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,162
No. Only spider webs.

109
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,964
- No sign?
- None.

110
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,528
It might be hiding somewhere,
but who knows?

111
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,938
That worries me.

112
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:39,000
Hey! I saw your weasel over here!

113
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,938
- Where is it?
- Right here.

114
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,919
- Over here?
- Yeah, behind this chest.

115
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:53,420
- You're right.
- It gathered a bunch of candy.

116
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,756
It's probably trying
to build a nest there.

117
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,455
That makes sense.

118
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,998
Yeah, but now that its wound
has been taken care of,

119
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:03,035
we should go ahead
and return this wildlife to the wild.

120
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,501
Muu-chan, if you would.

121
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,235
Take care now, little weasel.

122
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,750
Yoko, I think I'm gonna call it a day.

123
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,979
It looks like it might rain, too.

124
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,981
Oh. You're right.

125
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,388
Let's walk together part of the way.

126
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,960
Wildlife to the wild.

127
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,499
Bye-bye!

128
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,704
See ya.

129
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,367
Later, Muu-chan.
Bye, Suzu.

130
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,706
Ah, so you ran into her again.

131
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,211
That foreigner.

132
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,712
Hasumi?

133
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,807
Oh, Rosalie! Hey there.

134
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,214
Hello.

135
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:02,490
She always has
such a strange manner about her.

136
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,552
And that's not the half of it.

137
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,621
So what the heck do you want?

138
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:10,100
What the heck do I want?
How typically rude of you, Ichinomiya.

139
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:14,970
If I didn't want something, I wouldn't have
come to this dirty little hovel now, would I?

140
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,032
And you're calling me rude?

141
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,411
- Is something wrong?
- I saw him.

142
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:23,937
Who's "him"? Who was it?

143
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,213
You said that he'd gone missing, yes?

144
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,744
You mean you saw Haruka?
That's the person you saw?

145
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,918
Where at?

146
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,655
You remember that old
exhibition house, don't you?

147
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,720
He was alone out there.

148
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,632
What's the big idea?

149
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,999
Hey, watch it, you!

150
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,302
Rosalie, what do you think
you're doing?

151
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,001
I know I didn't raise you
to behave this way.

152
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,738
Haruka. Haruka.

153
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:53,904
Haruka!

154
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,433
He's not here.

155
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,934
We were too late.

156
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,649
Haruka!

157
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,657
Kantaro, wait up!

158
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,311
Haruka...

159
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,115
You're suffering, aren't you?

160
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,714
And it's because of that monster
you murdered

161
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:50,319
and because the instincts you'd lost
are now starting to awaken.

162
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,988
But I bear the blame,

163
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,035
because I left you as you were
when you had been sealed,

164
00:13:57,102 --> 00:14:00,094
incomplete, stripped of things
that define you -

165
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,801
all your memories
and all of your true powers.

166
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,343
Kantaro.

167
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:09,276
I'm sorry I put you through so much.

168
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,482
Well, will you give it back?

169
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,517
The true power
of the demon-eating goblin.

170
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,070
Doji Ibaragi!

171
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:41,807
It was you?

172
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,112
Too bad, Kantaro Ichinomiya.

173
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,381
Minamoto.

174
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,460
Yes, you are the one
to blame for this.

175
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:59,395
Because of you,
I can't awaken the demon-eating goblin.

176
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,233
Haruka.

177
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,863
That pathetic name
is the obstacle in my way.

178
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,338
I'm asking you to remove it.

179
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,402
Get rid of the name "Haruka" now.
Break the pact.

180
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,970
His confusion will vanish,

181
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:19,279
and the full power and memories
of the demon-eating goblin

182
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,342
will then be revived.

183
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,816
We desire his return to his original form,

184
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:33,354
the most powerful of monsters -
the demon-eating goblin.

185
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,532
Kantaro Ichinomiya...

186
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,867
...now give us what we desire!

187
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,167
I refuse.

188
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,435
Wrong answer.
Try again.

189
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:47,036
Look, I don't care what happens to me,
but I will not break our pact!

190
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,175
I see.

191
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,683
However...

192
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:58,018
What if you, perchance, were not the one
that something were to happen to?

193
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,148
What do you mean?

194
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,452
Kantaro!

195
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,550
That's Yoko.

196
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,926
Kantaro!

197
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,428
Kantaro!

198
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,228
Yoko, no!
Damn it, stay back!

199
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,261
Don't come any closer!

200
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,966
Om!

201
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,171
- Kantaro!
- Hey, where are you?

202
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,840
Yoko, talk to me!

203
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,180
- Damn!
- Help me, Kantaro!

204
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,684
Yoko?

205
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,153
What the hell have you done to her?!

206
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,691
Kantaro!

207
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:51,573
Yoko, hang on!

208
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,008
Kantaro.

209
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,812
Please help me! No! Let go!
Let go of me!

210
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:04,947
The realm of the dead lies beneath her.
Once she enters, it's all over.

211
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,185
She'll never be able to return
to this world.

212
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,717
No! Kantaro, help me!

213
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:14,132
Naumaku Sanmanda Bazaradan Kan!

214
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,666
No spell can penetrate that wall.

215
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,631
Om Makeishibaraya Sowaka!

216
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:31,981
You don't know when to quit, do you?
Be a good boy and give in.

217
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,278
No! Help me!

218
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,290
Kantaro!

219
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,087
Minamoto!

220
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,096
If you want it to stop,
then break the pact immediately.

221
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,227
Come on.

222
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,731
Come on.

223
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,657
You kept it, didn't you?

224
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,666
- Suzu?
- I thought you'd probably come here.

225
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,964
So you've you been waiting here?

226
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,977
It... It might have been better
if I'd never been freed.

227
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,445
Why do you think that, Haruka?

228
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:38,915
I don't know.

229
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:42,112
Well, I'm really glad
you did get released...

230
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:48,355
...because, you see, that way,
I-I got a chance to meet you, Haruka.

231
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,055
I'm sure Yoko feels the same way, too.

232
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,428
And Kantaro.

233
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,659
Let's go back.

234
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:58,066
They're all waiting for you.
You do know that, don't you?

235
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,502
I can't do that.

236
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,046
Why not?

237
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,557
Suzu, I'm not the kind of person
you seem to think I am.

238
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,026
No. You're a good person, Haruka.

239
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,119
No, I'm not.

240
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,188
You yourself witnessed me
murder that monster.

241
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:34,298
That's the kind of person I am.

242
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:38,139
Then-Then tell me this.
Why did you hold on to that vial?

243
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:46,315
You lost control of yourself for a moment.
That's why you did what you did.

244
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,616
Listen to me, Haruka.
I know the real you.

245
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,146
Kind of awkward,
but you're wonderful.

246
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,187
I am the demon-eating goblin!

247
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:01,562
I think nothing of killing,
human or monster!

248
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:02,964
I have no friends!

249
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,266
That's who I am.
That's the real me!

250
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,376
Liar.

251
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,979
Playtime is over now.

252
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,281
Haruka!

253
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,196
Kantaro.

254
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,006
- Yoko!
- Haruka!

255
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,373
Now then...

256
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,784
Break your pact
with the demon-eating goblin.

257
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,345
Do it, Kantaro Ichinomiya!

258
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,458
Help me, please!

259
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,892
Want her to vanish
from this world forever?

260
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,700
Yoko's in danger.

261
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,637
Haruka, please,
you gotta go help her! Hurry!

262
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,139
Haruka!

263
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,541
Haruka...

264
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,349
I am...

265
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,817
Haruka...

266
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,687
I am...

267
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:44,892
I am!

268
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:14,091
In the town at night

269
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:19,433
I found myself calling out to you

270
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:23,440
Though we're far apart

271
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:28,639
I won't fall prey to loneliness

272
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:33,947
When we feel there's
someone on our side

273
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,249
We all change

274
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:39,950
Becoming stronger, stronger, stronger

275
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:50,594
The unseen power invites hope

276
00:22:50,669 --> 00:23:03,377
The unseen power
is the courage you gave me

277
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,231
What will Kantaro's next case be?

278
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:23,268
Kantaro is caught squarely
in Raiko Minamoto's trap!

279
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:26,872
Yoko will be saved if Kantaro
breaks his pact with Haruka.

280
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,040
But he just can't do that!

281
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,677
Raiko launches a vicious attack
against an anguished Kantaro!

282
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:36,047
His words are like knives
piercing Kantaro's chest!

283
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:39,151
But just then, when his strength
is most in question,

284
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,219
the black goblin descends!

285
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:44,923
Next time on Tactics,
"A Long-Lost Heart."
