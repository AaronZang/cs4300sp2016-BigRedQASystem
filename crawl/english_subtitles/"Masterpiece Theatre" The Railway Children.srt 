1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:04,070
Three children find their lives
turned upside down

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,072
when their father
mysteriously vanishes.

3
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:08,074
WOMAN:
We're going to leave this house
and go and live in the country.

4
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:09,075
Why?

5
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:10,076
Because we've got to play

6
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:11,077
at being poor for a bit.

7
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:14,080
But living near the railroad
brings them adventures

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,081
they never dreamed of.

9
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,082
That tree over there,
it's moving!

10

20
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:58,625
ExxonMobil Masterpiece Theatre
has been brought to you

21
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,127
by a grant
from the ExxonMobil Corporation

22
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:05,131
every year... for 30 years.

23
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:11,137
Once upon a time,
and not so long ago, either

24
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:15,141
railroads were stuff that
children's dreams were made of.

25
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,144
They were not just
terrifying symbols of power

26
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,146
those huge, iron locomotives

27
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,649
thundering across
the countryside

28
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,151
spewing fire and steam;

29
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:29,155
they were also subversive agents
of discontent.

30
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:34,160
Trains could set you free from
the humdrum confines of home.

31
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,663
The wail of a train whistle
in the night

32
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:40,667
could start a child dreaming
of escape to adventure

33
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,670
in glory and faraway places.

34
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,173
Railroads were romance.

35
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:48,675
The Railway Children

36
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,177
Edith Nesbit's widely loved
family classic

37
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:54,180
is set in the early part
of the 20th century

38
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,684
when the great age of
railroading was well advanced.

39
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,185
If tonight's show

40
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,688
makes it look a bit more
glamorous than it really was

41
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:04,190
it's because we're seeing
railroad life

42
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,694
as the three children in
the story would have seen it.

43
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,697
They're from a well-to-do family

44
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:14,200
and glamorous though railroads
may have been at the time

45
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,203
proximity to steam locomotives
and coal smoke

46
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:21,708
didn't make for prime real
estate in the upper classes.

47
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,711
The story is about how
they and their mother

48
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,714
wound up living
down by the railroad tracks

49
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,717
and how it enriched their lives.

50
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,218
The cast includes

51
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,220
the celebrated
British film director

52
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,224
Richard Attenborough,
in a rare television appearance

53
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:43,229
playing a railroad tycoon
in a Santa Claus beard.

54
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,232
The mother's role is
played by Jenny Agutter

55
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,734
who scored a memorable triumph

56
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:52,238
in another movie version
of this story 30 years ago.

57
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:56,743
In that one,
she played the older daughter.

58
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,746
Now, "The Railway Children."

59
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,822
BOY:
Phyllis!

60
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,328
Come on!

61
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,332
Go away!

62
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:29,335
Get off... Peter.

63
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,837
PETER:
Sorry.

64
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,839
(children giggling)

65
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,343
(giggling)

66
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:40,346
Peter.

67
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,348
PETER:
Oh, please, it's my birthday.

68
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,850
MAN:
No, wait for Bobbie.

69
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,351
Can I open this one first?

70
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,853
Yes, you can,
go on.

71
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,354
I think I know
what it is.

72
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,355
Oh, it's
really heavy.

73
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,857
It must be a rock.

74
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,359
Oh.

75
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,360
Oh, hello.

76
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:02,869
Oh, thank you.

77
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,370
It's wonderful.

78
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,372
Good choice,
well done.

79
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,875
Is there anything
to go with it?

80
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,877
Oh, don't be
so ungrateful.

81
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:11,878
Under the bed.

82
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:12,879
Yes, here.

83
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,383
Open mine, it's pencils.

84
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:21,387
If you don't
like them,  
I'll have them.

85
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,389
Come on, you can help.

86
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,891
Oh, thank you.

87
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,393
Come on, let's
get it going.

88
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,395
Let's see
how it works.

89
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,906
(children chattering happily)

90
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,407
BOY:
You're "it" now.

91
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:44,410
BOY 2:
You're still "it" though.

92
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,912
BOY 3:
No, you're "it."

93
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,921
Phyllis, not too
much lemonade, okay?

94
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:59,425
(children chattering)

95
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:13,439
(coughing)

96
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,944
Right...
which child exploded?

97
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,452
Is there no hope?

98
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,954
Hope? Oh, yes.

99
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,957
Little bit of solder,
new valve, perhaps.

100
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,960
Yes, we'll have this
going again in next to no time.

101
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,961
You can all help.

102
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,963
Can girls help
mend engines?

103
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,464
They can
do anything
boys can do

104
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:39,465
can't they, Daddy?

105
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:40,967
Yes, of course they can.

106
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,970
MAID:
Two gentlemen
to see you, sir.

107
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,471
I've shown them
into the library.

108
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,477
Remind me to install a moat
and a drawbridge, would you?

109
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,979
So that nobody can disturb us.

110
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,223
MOTHER:
"The twins soon saw that
he could run the faster

111
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:06,793
"so they climbed
the spreading chestnut tree.

112
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,296
"The baker, his face
the color of raspberries

113
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,798
"stood at the foot of the tree

114
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:15,301
"and wondered where
the insolent twins had gone.

115
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,803
"A conker dropped on his head
out of the tree

116
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,304
"whereupon his face turned
from raspberry

117
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,306
to the darkest beet root."

118
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,809
FATHER (in other room):
...at the highest
possible levels.

119
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:23,810
MAN:
Nevertheless...

120
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,312
I wish we did have
a moat and drawbridge.

121
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,316
MAID:
Please, ma'am

122
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,818
the master would like for you

123
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:32,819
to step into
the study.

124
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,320
I think he's
had bad news.

125
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,822
My guess is

126
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:36,823
it's a death in the family

127
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:37,824
or the bank busted...

128
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,826
That will do, Ruth,
you can go.

129
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,846
I'm afraid Father's
been called away.

130
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:00,847
But why on earth...

131
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:01,848
Darling, go to bed.

132
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,349
Mummy, it wasn't
bad news, was it?

133
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,853
I can't tell you
anything tonight, my pet.

134
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,354
To bed, now!

135
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:14,861
(footsteps)

136
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,909
(laughing)

137
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:02,912
Ruth...

138
00:09:02,912 --> 00:09:04,413
why has Mother
gone to town?

139
00:09:04,914 --> 00:09:05,915
Ask me no questions

140
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:07,917
I'll tell you
no lies.

141
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,418
You'll know soon enough.

142
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,431
Peter, you mustn't ask.

143
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,933
Why not?

144
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:25,935
Mother will tell us
everything we need to know.

145
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:27,436
Goody-goody.

146
00:09:27,937 --> 00:09:28,938
Bobbie's right,
and you're a twit.

147
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:29,939
Oh, don't.

148
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:31,941
I'm sure there's
been some calamity.

149
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:33,442
Let's not make
things worse

150
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:35,945
by being horrid
to each other.

151
00:09:37,446 --> 00:09:38,948
"I know from what
I hear from the others

152
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:40,950
that he is in this house
this very blessed minute..."

153
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,952
(door opens and closes)

154
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:16,485
My darlings,
I want to tell you something.

155
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:20,489
The men that came last night
did bring very bad news...

156
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:23,993
and Father will be away
for some time.

157
00:10:23,993 --> 00:10:24,994
But where...

158
00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:28,998
Promise you won't ask me
or anyone else

159
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:29,999
about this trouble.

160
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:31,500
It's about business

161
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,503
and you know how hard
business is

162
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:37,006
to understand,
don't you?

163
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:39,508
Is it something to do
with Daddy's work
for the government?

164
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:42,011
Yes-- now, it's time for bed.

165
00:10:42,011 --> 00:10:45,014
And don't you worry, my darlings

166
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:47,516
it will all come
right in the end.

167
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:51,020
I've asked Aunt Emma
to come and stay.

168
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:09,538
I can hear somebody's shoes
dragging on the ground.

169
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:13,042
I know what
you're doing, Peter.

170
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:18,547
Dentata variegata.

171
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,064
(crying quietly)

172
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:50,579
Charles II.

173
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:54,083
1660 to 1685.

174
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,584
Edward IV.

175
00:11:57,086 --> 00:11:59,588
(sighing ):
Oh, I don't know.

176
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:01,590
I'm not sure it really matters.

177
00:12:03,092 --> 00:12:05,094
Of course it does.

178
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:09,598
1461 to 1483.

179
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:11,600
Thank you.

180
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:32,621
You'll come
to a bad end

181
00:12:33,122 --> 00:12:34,623
you horrible little child!

182
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:35,624
If you don't
mend your ways

183
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:36,625
you'll go to where

184
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,127
your precious father's gone!

185
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:02,651
Now, my little loves,
everything is settled.

186
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:04,153
We're going to leave
this house

187
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:06,155
and go and live in
the country.

188
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:07,156
I know you'll love it.

189
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:08,657
Is Aunt Emma
coming with us?

190
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:10,659
No, it'll just be us.

191
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:13,162
We're only taking
a few things from here.

192
00:13:13,162 --> 00:13:15,664
Just the useful ones.

193
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:17,666
Why?

194
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:23,672
Because we've got to play
at being poor for a bit.

195
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:29,178
(mouthing silently)

196
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:38,687
MAN:
Here we are, got it.

197
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,689
BOBBIE:
I know things
shouldn't matter but...

198
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:43,692
well, you get used
to them, don't you?

199
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:46,195
Oh, why do they
have to take that?

200
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:49,698
BOBBIE:
You know what Mother said.

201
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:53,202
Well, I think
a rocking horse
would be very useful.

202
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,709
MAN:
Mind the step.

203
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:03,111
There's another
one coming up.

204
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:22,631
I like moving house.

205
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:25,133
We should do it
every month.

206
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:26,635
Do you mind if we don't?

207
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:53,161
Wake up, loves.

208
00:14:53,662 --> 00:14:54,663
We're here.

209
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:01,670
STATION MASTER:
All tickets! All tickets!

210
00:15:07,676 --> 00:15:11,179
STATION MASTER:
Tickets, please.

211
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:12,180
Tickets.

212
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,181
Thank you.

213
00:15:13,181 --> 00:15:14,683
Thank you
very much.

214
00:15:14,683 --> 00:15:16,685
Tickets.

215
00:15:34,703 --> 00:15:35,704
(sneezes)

216
00:15:59,227 --> 00:16:02,731
(man panting)

217
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:11,740
(grunts)

218
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:13,742
BOBBIE:
Oh, Phil...

219
00:16:15,243 --> 00:16:17,746
Why is it
always you?

220
00:16:17,746 --> 00:16:18,747
Come on.

221
00:16:20,749 --> 00:16:22,751
Let's catch
them up, okay?

222
00:16:22,751 --> 00:16:23,752
All right.

223
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:33,261
MOTHER:
There's the house.

224
00:16:33,261 --> 00:16:34,763
I wonder where
Mrs. Viney is.

225
00:16:34,763 --> 00:16:36,264
Who?

226
00:16:36,264 --> 00:16:38,767
The woman I employed
to clean the place

227
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:40,268
and leave supper
for us.

228
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:06,294
She's, uh,
probably gone home--

229
00:17:06,294 --> 00:17:08,296
your train
was that late.

230
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:11,800
So... what are we
expected to do now?

231
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,302
Yes, well, it's...
it's a tricky one.

232
00:17:14,302 --> 00:17:16,304
We can, uh...

233
00:17:16,304 --> 00:17:18,807
we can use the key
under the doormat.

234
00:17:18,807 --> 00:17:21,309
That's what we
do around here.

235
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:24,312
Nobody ever
gets broken into...

236
00:17:24,312 --> 00:17:26,314
unless they deserve it.

237
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:28,817
Come on.

238
00:17:36,825 --> 00:17:37,826
What a horrid woman.

239
00:17:37,826 --> 00:17:39,327
She's walked off
with the money

240
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,329
and not left us
anything to eat at all.

241
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:43,832
We'll have to open one
of our own cases.

242
00:17:43,832 --> 00:17:44,833
(clanking)

243
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:45,834
What's that?

244
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:47,836
It'll be rats.

245
00:17:47,836 --> 00:17:49,838
If you're unlucky,
it'll be big rats.

246
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,843
Right, well, I'll
bid you good night.

247
00:17:54,843 --> 00:17:56,344
Good night.

248
00:18:05,854 --> 00:18:07,355
Oh, dear.

249
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:11,860
MOTHER:
Oh, that's better.

250
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,862
The great thing
is to be cheerful.

251
00:18:13,862 --> 00:18:15,864
Nobody can be
cheerful in the dark

252
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:17,365
except owls and bats.

253
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:18,366
I wish Father
was here.

254
00:18:20,368 --> 00:18:22,871
He'd get that packing case
open just like that.

255
00:18:22,871 --> 00:18:25,373
What are you
kicking me for, Bobbie?

256
00:18:25,373 --> 00:18:26,374
I wasn't.

257
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:37,385
It's very cold
for this time of year.

258
00:18:37,385 --> 00:18:39,387
Stop trying to be
so grown-up.

259
00:18:39,387 --> 00:18:40,388
MOTHER:
Peter.

260
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,393
Well, you've often wanted
something to happen--

261
00:18:45,393 --> 00:18:47,395
and now it has.

262
00:18:47,395 --> 00:18:49,898
I'm sure there aren't
really any rats.

263
00:18:49,898 --> 00:18:50,899
No.

264
00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:52,901
BOTH:
No.

265
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,418
(whispering):
Wake up.

266
00:19:10,418 --> 00:19:11,920
(in regular voice):
Wake up.

267
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,421
(cries out)

268
00:19:13,421 --> 00:19:15,423
There are no servants
or anything--

269
00:19:15,423 --> 00:19:17,425
we have to do
everything ourselves.

270
00:19:17,425 --> 00:19:19,928
I don't know how
to do anything.

271
00:19:19,928 --> 00:19:21,429
Shh!

272
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:22,931
Let's let Mummy sleep.

273
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,452
PETER:
Oh, that's just
the dining room.

274
00:19:46,454 --> 00:19:47,956
Father's chair.

275
00:20:06,474 --> 00:20:07,976
Another room!

276
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,982
The lady did
leave a meal after all.

277
00:20:13,982 --> 00:20:16,484
It just goes to show
you should never...

278
00:20:16,484 --> 00:20:17,485
PETER:
Phil!

279
00:20:17,485 --> 00:20:19,487
Come on, Phil!

280
00:20:19,487 --> 00:20:20,488
(laughing)

281
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:26,995
Oh, it's cold.

282
00:20:28,496 --> 00:20:29,497
Maybe not.

283
00:20:29,998 --> 00:20:30,999
Coward.

284
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:35,503
(yells)

285
00:20:37,005 --> 00:20:38,006
(squeals)

286
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:43,011
Peter!

287
00:20:55,523 --> 00:20:56,524
Come on, Bobbie!

288
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:21,650
What are we
going to live on?

289
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,151
Mummy's going
to write stories

290
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:25,153
and try to sell them.

291
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:26,655
We could help
by buying some.

292
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:29,157
Oh, no.

293
00:21:29,157 --> 00:21:30,659
And we must
make sure

294
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:31,660
she isn't
interrupted

295
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,662
when she's
upstairs writing.

296
00:21:33,662 --> 00:21:35,664
Yes, except
to bring her tea...

297
00:21:35,664 --> 00:21:37,666
or stroke her hair.

298
00:21:39,668 --> 00:21:41,670
I might want to.

299
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,673
What if Mummy
doesn't sell
any stories?

300
00:21:44,673 --> 00:21:47,175
Perhaps Daddy
could still get money.

301
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:48,677
I don't think so

302
00:21:48,677 --> 00:21:50,679
or we wouldn't
have needed

303
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:52,681
to sell off
the nice furniture.

304
00:21:52,681 --> 00:21:55,684
I think it's good
that we sold it.

305
00:21:55,684 --> 00:21:58,186
More room
to run around now.

306
00:21:58,186 --> 00:21:59,688
(distant chugging)

307
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:01,189
A train!

308
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:11,199
Peter!

309
00:22:24,713 --> 00:22:26,214
Gosh.

310
00:22:35,724 --> 00:22:37,726
(train whistle blows)

311
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:14,262
Hmm.

312
00:23:15,764 --> 00:23:17,265
How do you do?!

313
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:20,268
Oh, how do you do?

314
00:23:20,268 --> 00:23:21,269
You didn't get
chewed to death

315
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:22,270
by rats
last night then?

316
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,772
No.

317
00:23:23,772 --> 00:23:25,774
Mother says
it's probably
just one mouse.

318
00:23:25,774 --> 00:23:26,775
Ah-- bachelor,
is he?

319
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:28,276
Lives alone?

320
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:30,278
(chuckles)

321
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:32,280
Just ignore me.

322
00:23:32,781 --> 00:23:34,282
Half of everything I say

323
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:36,284
is more or less
complete nonsense.

324
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:39,788
The trick is trying to guess
which half.

325
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:43,792
Oh, Mrs. Ransome.

326
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:47,295
Off somewhere nice,
or to your sister's?

327
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:49,798
The carriage was
dusty last time.

328
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:51,299
Oh, was it?

329
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,301
Oh, I am sorry.

330
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:55,303
Although...
(clears throat)

331
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:56,805
I have to say

332
00:23:56,805 --> 00:23:59,307
the chief cause of
dust on the trains

333
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:00,809
is actually
dusty passengers.

334
00:24:03,812 --> 00:24:05,313
Oh, and thank you

335
00:24:05,313 --> 00:24:07,315
for carrying
our things last night.

336
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:09,818
Oh, heavens, there's
no need to thank me.

337
00:24:09,818 --> 00:24:11,820
It's my job.

338
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,822
We've come
from London.

339
00:24:13,822 --> 00:24:15,323
Oh, London...

340
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:16,825
How is London these days?

341
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:19,828
We had to sell
some of our furniture.

342
00:24:19,828 --> 00:24:21,830
Oh...

343
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,832
What was wrong with it?

344
00:24:23,832 --> 00:24:26,835
Don't listen, she just,
um, says things.

345
00:24:26,835 --> 00:24:28,336
Excuse me...

346
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:29,838
You getting
on the train?

347
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,343
No, we're stuck here
for the time being.

348
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:40,348
Well, go and sit somewhere,
if you'd be so kind.

349
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:41,850
You're impeding free movement.

350
00:24:46,855 --> 00:24:49,357
(sighs)

351
00:25:08,877 --> 00:25:10,879
(whispering):
You ask.

352
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:11,880
No, you ask.

353
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,882
You're the one
who said you were cold.

354
00:25:13,882 --> 00:25:15,383
Well, I am-- I'm freezing.

355
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:16,384
So you ask.

356
00:25:16,384 --> 00:25:17,385
No.

357
00:25:17,385 --> 00:25:18,887
Will you ask?

358
00:25:22,891 --> 00:25:23,892
MOTHER:
Hello?

359
00:25:29,898 --> 00:25:31,900
Um, we were wondering

360
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,402
if we could
light a fire.

361
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:38,907
No, loves, coal is so dear.

362
00:25:38,907 --> 00:25:41,409
If you're cold,
dress up more warmly.

363
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:51,419
I hate being cold.

364
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,421
I hate being able
to only have

365
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:55,423
jam or butter
at tea-time.

366
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:57,425
Don't go on, Phil.

367
00:25:57,425 --> 00:26:00,929
I mean, you're
supposed to have
them together.

368
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:02,931
It's like...
steak and kidney.

369
00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:04,432
I'm going on
a lone adventure.

370
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:05,934
BOBBIE:
What?

371
00:26:05,934 --> 00:26:07,435
I can't tell you
what it is

372
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:08,937
because
it may be wrong

373
00:26:08,937 --> 00:26:10,939
and I don't want
to drag you into it.

374
00:26:10,939 --> 00:26:13,942
Can I be the damson
in distress next time?

375
00:26:13,942 --> 00:26:15,443
I'm always a savage.

376
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:17,445
"Damsel."

377
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:19,447
"Damson" is
a type of plum.

378
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:21,950
Oh, and Peter, don't
do it if it's wrong.

379
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,952
Or we should
all do it together.

380
00:26:23,952 --> 00:26:25,453
No, you can't come.

381
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:27,455
It's a lone adventure.

382
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:15,503
(coal clattering)

383
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:41,029
Oi, get off!

384
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:42,530
You little thief!

385
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,032
I'm not a thief,
I'm a coal miner!

386
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:45,033
Tell that
to the marines.

387
00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:46,034
Come along
to the station.

388
00:27:46,034 --> 00:27:47,535
No, no, not
the police station.

389
00:27:47,535 --> 00:27:50,038
You're that boy from
Three Chimneys, aren't you?

390
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:51,539
Is there anyone else
in your gang?

391
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,541
No, honestly,
I promise.

392
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:55,043
BOBBIE:
Only us.

393
00:27:55,043 --> 00:27:56,044
Right.

394
00:28:01,616 --> 00:28:02,116
Look at you

395
00:28:02,116 --> 00:28:05,620
so nicely dressed
and all.

396
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,621
Haven't you been to church?

397
00:28:06,621 --> 00:28:08,623
Don't you know
it's wrong to steal?!

398
00:28:08,623 --> 00:28:10,625
I didn't think it was stealing.

399
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:13,127
I only took it from
the middle of the heap

400
00:28:13,127 --> 00:28:14,629
so it counted as mining.

401
00:28:14,629 --> 00:28:16,130
It'll take you
thousands of years

402
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,131
to burn up
all that coal.

403
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:18,633
Not quite.

404
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:20,635
Poorer folk
scrimp and save for coal.

405
00:28:20,635 --> 00:28:23,638
You lot
can afford it.

406
00:28:23,638 --> 00:28:26,140
But you think
it's yours by right.

407
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,643
No, at our other house
we always used to have fires

408
00:28:28,643 --> 00:28:29,644
when it was cold.

409
00:28:29,644 --> 00:28:30,645
Now Mother says

410
00:28:30,645 --> 00:28:32,146
we're too poor
to have a fire now.

411
00:28:32,146 --> 00:28:32,647
Peter, don't.

412
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:34,148
(clears throat)

413
00:28:34,148 --> 00:28:39,654
They, they actually had
to sell all their furniture.

414
00:28:39,654 --> 00:28:42,657
Thank you for your contribution,
Mr. Perks.

415
00:28:42,657 --> 00:28:45,660
Highly welcome.

416
00:28:48,162 --> 00:28:50,665
Well, perhaps
I was a bit harsh.

417
00:28:50,665 --> 00:28:55,169
But remember,
stealing is stealing

418
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:56,671
why ever you do it.

419
00:28:58,673 --> 00:29:00,675
I'll overlook it
this time.

420
00:29:00,675 --> 00:29:02,176
Now, get along home.

421
00:29:03,678 --> 00:29:05,179
Uh, thank you.

422
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:06,681
Thank you.

423
00:29:08,683 --> 00:29:10,184
You're a darling.

424
00:29:11,686 --> 00:29:12,687
(softly):
That's all right.

425
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:18,693
BOBBIE:
Peter.

426
00:29:18,693 --> 00:29:20,695
PETER:
Don't speak to me!

427
00:29:20,695 --> 00:29:22,697
You're spies and traitors!

428
00:29:22,697 --> 00:29:24,699
I'm not even sure,
actually

429
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:26,200
that mining is a crime.

430
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:35,710
The Green Dragon's...

431
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,212
three and a quarter
minutes late.

432
00:29:38,713 --> 00:29:40,715
I wish it could take
our love to Father.

433
00:29:40,715 --> 00:29:43,217
I wonder why
he doesn't write to us.

434
00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:44,719
PHYLLIS:
Mmm...

435
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:45,720
I really miss him.

436
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,221
Me, too.

437
00:29:47,221 --> 00:29:49,223
I'm afraid
he'll forget about us.

438
00:29:49,223 --> 00:29:50,725
He won't, Phil.

439
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:52,226
He's probably terribly busy.

440
00:29:52,226 --> 00:29:54,729
That's why it's called
being away on busy-ness.

441
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:55,730
Is that true?

442
00:30:02,236 --> 00:30:04,739
Let's all wave at
the Green Dragon as it goes by.

443
00:30:04,739 --> 00:30:07,742
It might understand and
take our love to him in London.

444
00:30:07,742 --> 00:30:09,243
Yes, why not?

445
00:30:38,773 --> 00:30:42,276
(children laughing excitedly)

446
00:30:49,283 --> 00:30:51,786
Why don't we go to
the station anymore?

447
00:30:51,786 --> 00:30:54,288
Because we might meet
the station master.

448
00:30:54,288 --> 00:30:56,290
I'm not scared
of the station master.

449
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,292
Tell that to
the marines.

450
00:30:58,292 --> 00:31:01,295
(laughing)

451
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:03,798
(Bobbie continues to laugh)

452
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:09,804
At last, a sensible editor.

453
00:31:10,304 --> 00:31:12,306
He's taken my story.

454
00:31:12,306 --> 00:31:13,808
Well done, Mother.

455
00:31:13,808 --> 00:31:15,810
Well, we could do with the money

456
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:16,811
and that's the truth.

457
00:31:16,811 --> 00:31:19,814
Oh, let's buy a big...
something!

458
00:31:19,814 --> 00:31:21,315
Does this mean

459
00:31:21,315 --> 00:31:23,317
we can afford
to go back to London?

460
00:31:24,318 --> 00:31:26,320
No... better
than that

461
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,322
we can celebrate
with buns for tea.

462
00:31:28,322 --> 00:31:32,827
(sheep bleating)

463
00:31:37,832 --> 00:31:38,833
Morning.

464
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:39,834
Good morning.

465
00:31:44,338 --> 00:31:45,339
Excuse me.

466
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:48,342
I'd rather you weren't
polite to me.

467
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:49,343
Beg your pardon?

468
00:31:49,343 --> 00:31:50,845
I think
you're being polite to me

469
00:31:50,845 --> 00:31:53,848
because you don't remember that
it was me who took the coal.

470
00:31:53,848 --> 00:31:54,849
And it was.

471
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:55,850
I'm sorry.

472
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,852
Oh, don't you worry about that.

473
00:31:57,852 --> 00:31:59,353
Let bygones be bygones.

474
00:31:59,353 --> 00:32:01,355
What have you
got there?

475
00:32:01,355 --> 00:32:02,356
Buns.

476
00:32:02,356 --> 00:32:03,858
Oh?

477
00:32:03,858 --> 00:32:05,359
I thought you were all so poor.

478
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,361
Mother's sold a story.

479
00:32:07,361 --> 00:32:08,362
We're going to have buns

480
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:09,864
every time
she sells a poem or a story.

481
00:32:09,864 --> 00:32:10,865
Oh?

482
00:32:10,865 --> 00:32:12,867
Poems and stories, is it?

483
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:15,369
Well, you ought to be proud
to have such a clever mother.

484
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,872
Yes.

485
00:32:17,872 --> 00:32:20,374
Although we preferred it when
she didn't have to be clever

486
00:32:20,374 --> 00:32:21,375
and she could play with us.

487
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:23,878
Well, you should look in
to the station

488
00:32:24,378 --> 00:32:25,379
whenever you fancy it.

489
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,381
Yes.

490
00:32:27,381 --> 00:32:28,883
We might well do that.

491
00:32:28,883 --> 00:32:29,884
Thank you.

492
00:32:37,892 --> 00:32:41,896
PHYLLIS:
Stop! My bootlace
is undone again!

493
00:32:41,896 --> 00:32:43,397
(children panting)

494
00:32:43,397 --> 00:32:46,400
(train chugging)

495
00:33:16,931 --> 00:33:18,432
That's actually the sign

496
00:33:18,432 --> 00:33:21,435
for the emergency cord on the
train-- stop it, dead on.

497
00:33:21,936 --> 00:33:24,939
"Two pounds ten shillings fine
for improper use."

498
00:33:24,939 --> 00:33:25,940
Well, what counts
as proper use?

499
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,942
Don't know, being
murdered, more or less.

500
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:29,443
Oh.

501
00:33:29,443 --> 00:33:31,946
You know, there was
this old woman once

502
00:33:31,946 --> 00:33:33,447
and somebody
kidded her on

503
00:33:33,447 --> 00:33:34,448
that the emergency cord

504
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:36,450
was actually
a refreshment room bell.

505
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,953
So she got up, she pulled
the cord, the train stopped

506
00:33:38,953 --> 00:33:40,454
the guard rushed in
and she said:

507
00:33:40,454 --> 00:33:42,456
"Oh, there you are.

508
00:33:42,456 --> 00:33:44,458
I'll have a glass of stout
and a pork pie, please."

509
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,460
(laughing)

510
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,462
STATION MASTER:
Morning, children.

511
00:33:48,462 --> 00:33:50,464
PHYLLIS:
Tickets, please.

512
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:52,967
Why do all the trains
have numbers on
the front?

513
00:33:52,967 --> 00:33:54,969
It's so as we'll know
which one's which.

514
00:33:54,969 --> 00:33:57,471
I actually
knew a young gent once

515
00:33:57,471 --> 00:34:01,475
that took down all the numbers
of all the trains he ever saw

516
00:34:01,475 --> 00:34:03,477
and he wrote them
in a notebook.

517
00:34:03,477 --> 00:34:05,479
Why did he
do that?

518
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:06,981
Nobody knows.

519
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:14,989
(Mr. Perks whistling)

520
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,991
So the old lady pulled
the little handle thing

521
00:34:16,991 --> 00:34:18,993
and said to
the train driver

522
00:34:18,993 --> 00:34:21,996
or the guard or whoever
the man was...

523
00:34:21,996 --> 00:34:23,497
No, I've missed out a bit.

524
00:34:24,999 --> 00:34:26,500
Anyway, it was very funny.

525
00:34:28,002 --> 00:34:30,004
I've been meaning
to ask you--

526
00:34:30,004 --> 00:34:32,006
when you go down
to the station

527
00:34:32,006 --> 00:34:33,507
you won't walk
on the line, will you?

528
00:34:33,507 --> 00:34:35,509
Well, didn't you ever walk
on the railway lines

529
00:34:35,509 --> 00:34:36,510
when you were little?

530
00:34:38,012 --> 00:34:40,514
Yes.

531
00:34:40,514 --> 00:34:41,515
Very well, then.

532
00:34:43,017 --> 00:34:44,518
But be careful.

533
00:34:44,518 --> 00:34:46,520
Imagine how
I'd feel if you got hurt.

534
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,023
(Peter and Phyllis
shrieking playfully outside)

535
00:34:49,023 --> 00:34:51,525
You know how much
I love you all.

536
00:34:51,525 --> 00:34:55,529
PHYLLIS:
Come and get me, Peter!

537
00:34:55,529 --> 00:34:58,532
How long can you remember
someone you really love--

538
00:34:58,532 --> 00:35:01,268
even if you're
desperate to

539
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:04,338
if... you don't
see them or...

540
00:35:04,338 --> 00:35:05,840
hear their voice?

541
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:09,844
Forever, my love.

542
00:35:11,345 --> 00:35:13,347
Forever.

543
00:35:13,347 --> 00:35:15,349
(teacup and saucer clattering)

544
00:35:21,856 --> 00:35:24,358
What's going
to happen to us?

545
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,862
(footsteps approaching)

546
00:35:50,885 --> 00:35:54,388
Your mother
has influenza.

547
00:35:54,388 --> 00:35:55,890
I'm sure she'll
be all right

548
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:00,394
but we're going to have to
look after her-- carefully.

549
00:36:00,394 --> 00:36:01,896
You look rather solemn.

550
00:36:01,896 --> 00:36:03,898
I think you
should be head nurse.

551
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:06,400
Yes.

552
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,902
I'll send down
some medicine.

553
00:36:07,902 --> 00:36:11,405
Keep up a good fire.

554
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:13,908
Have some strong beef tea made
for when her fever goes down.

555
00:36:13,908 --> 00:36:17,411
She can have grapes now
and beef essence.

556
00:36:17,411 --> 00:36:18,913
Soda water and milk...

557
00:36:19,413 --> 00:36:22,416
And a bottle of the best brandy.

558
00:36:24,418 --> 00:36:26,921
I'll write it down.

559
00:36:28,422 --> 00:36:30,424
I can't afford
all this... rubbish.

560
00:36:30,925 --> 00:36:32,927
But, Mother, you need
all these things.

561
00:36:32,927 --> 00:36:35,429
Ask Mrs. Viney...

562
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:37,932
(hoarsely):
to boil up a
scrag-end of mutton

563
00:36:37,932 --> 00:36:39,934
for your supper
tomorrow night.

564
00:36:42,436 --> 00:36:44,939
I'll have the broth.

565
00:36:44,939 --> 00:36:45,940
(sighs deeply)

566
00:37:00,955 --> 00:37:03,958
(whispering):
Well, we've got
the shilling for the mutton.

567
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:05,960
We don't need that.

568
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,962
All we need is
bread and water.

569
00:37:07,962 --> 00:37:11,465
People have
lived on less
on desert islands.

570
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:12,967
That's true.

571
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:15,469
So Mrs. Viney
can spend the shilling

572
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:17,471
on Mother's brandy and beef tea.

573
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:19,974
How are we going to buy
all the other things?

574
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:21,475
I don't know.

575
00:37:22,977 --> 00:37:24,979
But we've got to get
Mother better.

576
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:31,986
(birds singing)

577
00:38:04,018 --> 00:38:05,519
Come on, I'll do it.

578
00:38:58,072 --> 00:39:00,074
(train wheels squealing)

579
00:39:02,576 --> 00:39:05,079
I'm so sorry to disturb
you in your train

580
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:07,581
but we feel we know you
a little from waving
so often.

581
00:39:07,581 --> 00:39:08,582
Yes.

582
00:39:08,582 --> 00:39:10,584
Please, take this.

583
00:39:10,584 --> 00:39:12,586
Thank you, my dear.

584
00:39:12,586 --> 00:39:15,089
(engine chugging)

585
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:19,093
STATION MASTER:
Thank you.

586
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,601
BOBBIE:
"Dear Mr.
We Do Not Know Your Name:

587
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:30,104
"Mother is ill
and the doctor says

588
00:39:30,104 --> 00:39:33,607
"to give her the things
at the end of this letter.

589
00:39:33,607 --> 00:39:35,109
"But she says
we can't afford it

590
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:37,611
"and to get mutton for us
and she will have the broth.

591
00:39:37,611 --> 00:39:40,114
"We do not know
anybody here but you

592
00:39:40,614 --> 00:39:43,117
"because Father is away
and we do not know the address.

593
00:39:43,117 --> 00:39:44,118
"Father will pay you,

594
00:39:44,118 --> 00:39:46,620
or if he has lost all his money
or anything,

595
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,622
Peter will pay you
when he is a man."

596
00:40:09,143 --> 00:40:12,146
Old gentleman asked me
to fetch this up right away.

597
00:40:12,146 --> 00:40:14,648
Oh, thank you
very much, Mr. Perks.

598
00:40:14,648 --> 00:40:18,152
Oh, I've carried a few
hampers in my time--

599
00:40:18,152 --> 00:40:20,654
especially during
the hamper season.

600
00:40:20,654 --> 00:40:24,158
The worst thing I've
ever had to carry...

601
00:40:24,158 --> 00:40:27,661
was a fish tank-- with
the water still in it.

602
00:40:27,661 --> 00:40:30,164
If anybody ever asks you
to carry a fish tank

603
00:40:30,164 --> 00:40:32,666
with the water still in it,
just say to them, say...

604
00:40:35,169 --> 00:40:38,172
Well, you can say anything you
like because nobody's listening.

605
00:40:38,172 --> 00:40:41,175
(Mr. Perks panting)

606
00:40:42,676 --> 00:40:46,680
I'm very sorry, but I don't
have twopence to give you
like Father does.

607
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:50,684
Just drop that
right now, young man.

608
00:40:52,186 --> 00:40:53,687
I just wanted to say I was sorry

609
00:40:53,687 --> 00:40:55,189
to hear your mother
wasn't well and...

610
00:40:55,689 --> 00:41:00,194
to bring her some...
some sweet briar

611
00:41:00,194 --> 00:41:02,196
because it smells
so nice.

612
00:41:02,196 --> 00:41:04,198
I'm not looking
for any twopence.

613
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,203
I beg your pardon.

614
00:41:09,203 --> 00:41:11,705
Right, well...

615
00:41:11,705 --> 00:41:13,207
no offense.

616
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:17,211
Twopence from kiddiwinks,
indeed.

617
00:41:19,713 --> 00:41:21,715
BOBBIE:
"Dear Roberta and
Phyllis and Peter

618
00:41:22,216 --> 00:41:23,217
"here are the things
you want.

619
00:41:23,217 --> 00:41:26,220
Your mother will want
to know where they
came from."

620
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,221
Two chickens!

621
00:41:28,222 --> 00:41:29,223
"Tell her they were sent

622
00:41:29,223 --> 00:41:30,724
"by a friend
who heard she was ill.

623
00:41:30,724 --> 00:41:35,729
When she is well again, you
must tell her about it,
of course."

624
00:41:35,729 --> 00:41:36,730
"Ee-ore de kolog-nee."

625
00:41:37,731 --> 00:41:39,233
PHYLLIS:
Eau de Cologne, silly.

626
00:41:39,233 --> 00:41:41,735
It's for dabbing on

627
00:41:41,735 --> 00:41:44,238
in places you think
you're going to be kissed.

628
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:32,252
MOTHER:
You must never

629
00:42:32,252 --> 00:42:34,755
never, never ask strangers
to give us things.

630
00:42:34,755 --> 00:42:35,756
Is that clear?

631
00:42:35,756 --> 00:42:36,757
It's not
right to go

632
00:42:36,757 --> 00:42:38,258
telling everyone
about our affairs.

633
00:42:38,258 --> 00:42:39,259
Why?

634
00:42:39,259 --> 00:42:41,762
There are lots of bills
coming in, you said.

635
00:42:41,762 --> 00:42:42,763
I know there's
the doctor.

636
00:42:42,763 --> 00:42:45,766
I know, we're poor,
but we've got enough
to live on.

637
00:42:45,766 --> 00:42:48,268
Now, I'm going to write
to your "Old Gentleman"

638
00:42:48,268 --> 00:42:52,272
thanking him, but telling him
I don't approve of what you did.

639
00:42:53,774 --> 00:42:55,275
I still think we
were right to ask

640
00:42:55,275 --> 00:42:56,276
because otherwise...

641
00:42:56,276 --> 00:42:57,778
No, Peter, there are some things

642
00:42:57,778 --> 00:42:59,780
that people like us just
don't do, no matter what.

643
00:43:01,281 --> 00:43:02,783
Now, we won't talk
about it anymore.

644
00:43:13,293 --> 00:43:14,795
(sighs)

645
00:43:16,296 --> 00:43:18,298
Because it can strike
at any moment, illness

646
00:43:18,298 --> 00:43:19,299
that's the frightening thing.

647
00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:21,301
One minute you're standing up,
the next minute

648
00:43:21,301 --> 00:43:22,302
you're lying down.

649
00:43:22,302 --> 00:43:22,803
Mrs. Viney...

650
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:24,304
From standing up to lying down

651
00:43:24,304 --> 00:43:25,806
in as little
as a minute.

652
00:43:25,806 --> 00:43:28,308
Now, the doctor--
he'll be expensive.

653
00:43:28,308 --> 00:43:30,811
I should know...

654
00:43:30,811 --> 00:43:33,313
I've been under him
several times.

655
00:43:33,313 --> 00:43:34,815
(softly):
Very warm hands.

656
00:43:41,321 --> 00:43:43,323
Oh, you're throwing
it all wonkily.

657
00:43:43,323 --> 00:43:44,324
You do it then.

658
00:43:44,324 --> 00:43:46,326
I can't bat
andbowl.

659
00:43:52,332 --> 00:43:53,834
Oh!

660
00:43:54,835 --> 00:43:56,336
I want a brother!

661
00:43:57,838 --> 00:43:59,840
(sheep bleating)

662
00:44:02,342 --> 00:44:07,347
(spirited conversation
and shouting)

663
00:44:26,867 --> 00:44:33,373
(conversation not audible)

664
00:44:33,373 --> 00:44:35,876
So...

665
00:44:36,376 --> 00:44:36,877
nobody's ill?

666
00:44:37,377 --> 00:44:38,378
No.

667
00:44:38,378 --> 00:44:39,880
Good.

668
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,882
Makes a change.

669
00:44:41,882 --> 00:44:43,884
I get a lot of illness.

670
00:44:47,387 --> 00:44:48,388
Blurt it all out, then.

671
00:44:48,388 --> 00:44:49,389
What's the trouble?

672
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:50,891
It's rather hard
to just blurt it out

673
00:44:50,891 --> 00:44:52,392
because of what Mother said.

674
00:44:52,392 --> 00:44:54,394
What did Mother say?

675
00:44:54,394 --> 00:44:57,898
That I wasn't to go telling
everyone we were poor.

676
00:44:58,899 --> 00:45:01,902
But you're not
everyone, are you?

677
00:45:01,902 --> 00:45:04,404
Not at all.

678
00:45:04,404 --> 00:45:05,906
Well...
(clears throat)

679
00:45:05,906 --> 00:45:09,409
I know from Mrs. Viney
that doctors are expensive

680
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:10,911
and you're a good doctor

681
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:12,913
so you must be
very expensive.

682
00:45:12,913 --> 00:45:14,915
You might think so,
mightn't you?

683
00:45:14,915 --> 00:45:16,416
So, sir, I asked her how
she could afford you

684
00:45:16,917 --> 00:45:18,919
because I know she's much
poorer than we are--

685
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:19,920
I've been in her house.

686
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,921
Ah.

687
00:45:20,921 --> 00:45:24,424
She said her
doctoring only cost
a twopence a week

688
00:45:24,424 --> 00:45:25,926
because she belonged
to a club.

689
00:45:25,926 --> 00:45:27,427
And I don't want
Mother to be anxious

690
00:45:27,427 --> 00:45:29,930
and I thought I'd
ask you, can we be
in the club, too?

691
00:45:34,434 --> 00:45:35,936
You're not cross with me,
are you?

692
00:45:37,938 --> 00:45:39,940
You're probably not
very wealthy, either.

693
00:45:43,443 --> 00:45:45,445
How could I be cross?

694
00:45:45,445 --> 00:45:46,947
You're very sensible.

695
00:45:51,952 --> 00:45:53,954
I'll make it all right
with your mother.

696
00:45:58,458 --> 00:45:59,960
Now, don't you worry

697
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,962
or you'll make
yourself ill.

698
00:46:01,962 --> 00:46:03,964
Then, I'll have
to send you a bill

699
00:46:03,964 --> 00:46:05,966
as long as that
railway line.

700
00:46:09,469 --> 00:46:11,471
(horse snorts)

701
00:46:11,471 --> 00:46:13,473
Shall we wave at
the people in the boat

702
00:46:13,473 --> 00:46:16,476
like we wave
at the old gentleman?

703
00:46:17,477 --> 00:46:19,479
The problem is,
we'd wave

704
00:46:19,479 --> 00:46:23,483
and we'd still
all be there,
watching each other.

705
00:46:23,483 --> 00:46:25,485
You really think
you'll catch something?

706
00:46:25,485 --> 00:46:26,987
Yes.
Yes.

707
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:28,488
You haven't even
got a hook, Phil.

708
00:46:28,488 --> 00:46:30,490
Well, I don't want
to hurt the fish.

709
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:32,492
(chuckles)

710
00:46:32,492 --> 00:46:34,494
Come on, we should go
and meet Mother off the train.

711
00:46:36,496 --> 00:46:38,498
PETER:
Hello, excuse me.

712
00:46:38,498 --> 00:46:39,499
What's the time?

713
00:46:39,499 --> 00:46:42,002
Only I dropped my watch
in the water, but...

714
00:46:42,002 --> 00:46:43,503
Mind your own business.

715
00:46:43,503 --> 00:46:45,005
Posh bloody kids.

716
00:46:46,506 --> 00:46:48,008
Stuck up.

717
00:46:48,008 --> 00:46:49,009
Ow!

718
00:46:49,009 --> 00:46:50,010
Girls:
Hey!

719
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:55,015
Why did you say that?

720
00:46:55,015 --> 00:46:56,016
That's horrible.

721
00:46:56,516 --> 00:46:58,518
We're just normal...
children.

722
00:46:58,518 --> 00:46:59,519
We're not posh.

723
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:02,522
I've repaired this dress
a hundred times.

724
00:47:02,522 --> 00:47:06,026
And even if we were
posh, we'd still
care about you

725
00:47:06,026 --> 00:47:09,029
and not despise you
just because you were
poorer than us.

726
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:11,031
Right--

727
00:47:11,031 --> 00:47:14,534
next time,
they'll be sorry.

728
00:47:14,534 --> 00:47:17,537
Perhaps we should stick
to the railway.

729
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:26,546
(train rumbling)

730
00:47:26,546 --> 00:47:28,548
STATION MASTER:
Tickets!

731
00:47:29,549 --> 00:47:31,551
Tickets, please.

732
00:47:31,551 --> 00:47:33,053
Thank you.

733
00:47:33,053 --> 00:47:34,554
Tickets.

734
00:47:34,554 --> 00:47:35,555
Can you see
Mother yet?

735
00:47:35,555 --> 00:47:37,057
No.

736
00:47:37,057 --> 00:47:39,059
It's not her train.

737
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:41,061
Something's happening.

738
00:47:41,061 --> 00:47:43,563
(man speaking agitatedly
in Russian)

739
00:47:43,563 --> 00:47:44,564
STATION MASTER:
Now then,
step aside.

740
00:47:44,564 --> 00:47:46,566
I'll attend to this,
if you please.

741
00:47:46,566 --> 00:47:49,069
Well, what's
the trouble?

742
00:47:49,069 --> 00:47:51,571
Ya zaplatil za svoy bilet.

743
00:47:51,571 --> 00:47:57,577
Nu, ya to... za... vchera!

744
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:02,082
No, don't
understand a word.

745
00:48:02,082 --> 00:48:03,583
Mother knows languages.

746
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,085
She'll be on the next train

747
00:48:05,085 --> 00:48:07,087
from Maidbridge.

748
00:48:07,087 --> 00:48:10,090
This way...

749
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:11,591
if you please.

750
00:48:11,591 --> 00:48:14,594
(crowd murmuring)

751
00:48:14,594 --> 00:48:17,097
Well, he's got no tickets

752
00:48:17,097 --> 00:48:20,100
and no visible means
of support.

753
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,102
I'm not sure I
shouldn't send
for the police.

754
00:48:22,102 --> 00:48:23,103
CHILDREN:
No!

755
00:48:23,103 --> 00:48:24,104
Nyet, nyet.

756
00:48:24,104 --> 00:48:27,107
Dlya politsii nyet
ni kakue nyzhdi.

757
00:48:27,107 --> 00:48:29,109
(train whistling)

758
00:48:29,109 --> 00:48:34,614
(crying)

759
00:48:37,617 --> 00:48:42,122
(slowly):
Are you Welsh?

760
00:48:42,122 --> 00:48:44,124
Look, we'll show him
these foreign stamps

761
00:48:44,624 --> 00:48:47,127
and he can tell us
if he recognizes
his country.

762
00:48:47,127 --> 00:48:50,130
PETER:
Norwegian--

763
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:51,131
that's a nice one.

764
00:48:51,131 --> 00:48:52,632
PERKS:
No, no!

765
00:48:52,632 --> 00:48:53,633
He's not Norwegian.

766
00:48:53,633 --> 00:48:55,635
He'd be wearing one
of them thick jumpers

767
00:48:55,635 --> 00:48:57,137
if he was Norwegian.

768
00:49:02,642 --> 00:49:03,977
Smotrete.

769
00:49:03,977 --> 00:49:07,047
Vot-- Russkaya!

770
00:49:07,047 --> 00:49:09,549
Ya rodima tuda.

771
00:49:09,549 --> 00:49:10,550
Eta moya rodina.

772
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:13,553
Oh, he's Russian!

773
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:22,062
Mais je parle
francais aussi.

774
00:49:22,062 --> 00:49:23,563
CHILDREN:
Oh.

775
00:49:25,065 --> 00:49:31,571
You can stay
at our house.

776
00:49:35,575 --> 00:49:37,577
Vous tes tous
tres gentils.

777
00:49:37,577 --> 00:49:41,081
Spacibo.

778
00:49:41,581 --> 00:49:45,585
Well, uh,
bon voyage.

779
00:49:51,591 --> 00:49:53,593
He's worn out...

780
00:49:53,593 --> 00:49:56,096
body and soul.

781
00:49:56,096 --> 00:50:02,102
He should go straight
to bed and must
be kept warm.

782
00:50:02,102 --> 00:50:03,103
Thank you.

783
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:13,613
Zdravstvuyte.

784
00:50:13,613 --> 00:50:16,116
That means "hello"
in Russian...

785
00:50:16,116 --> 00:50:19,119
or perhaps "good-bye."

786
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,121
I think he might need
to join your club.

787
00:50:21,621 --> 00:50:24,124
He's got nothing.

788
00:50:24,624 --> 00:50:26,126
I saw him crying.

789
00:50:27,627 --> 00:50:29,629
Please don't.

790
00:50:29,629 --> 00:50:31,631
You wouldn't smile
if you'd seen him.

791
00:50:31,631 --> 00:50:34,634
I've never seen
a man cry before.

792
00:50:36,636 --> 00:50:37,637
I'm sorry.

793
00:50:41,641 --> 00:50:42,642
(man coughs)

794
00:50:42,642 --> 00:50:44,644
MOTHER:
We must find you some clothes.

795
00:50:44,644 --> 00:50:48,648
(coughing)

796
00:51:02,162 --> 00:51:04,664
BOBBIE:
Mother, why hasn't Father
taken his clothes?

797
00:51:09,169 --> 00:51:11,671
Daddy isn't...

798
00:51:11,671 --> 00:51:13,173
he isn't dead, is he?

799
00:51:13,173 --> 00:51:15,175
Oh, darling Bobbie.

800
00:51:15,175 --> 00:51:16,676
No.

801
00:51:16,676 --> 00:51:18,678
No, of course not.

802
00:51:18,678 --> 00:51:19,679
Daddy's quite,
quite well

803
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,182
when I heard
from him last.

804
00:51:23,683 --> 00:51:26,186
And he'll come back
to us, someday.

805
00:51:36,696 --> 00:51:38,198
Tell me about
the Russian man.

806
00:51:38,198 --> 00:51:40,200
He's a writer.

807
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,703
He wrote about how to
make conditions better

808
00:51:43,703 --> 00:51:45,705
for the poor
in his country.

809
00:51:45,705 --> 00:51:49,709
The tsar sent him away
to a cruel and harsh
prison for life.

810
00:51:49,709 --> 00:51:50,710
How did he get away?

811
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:53,213
He escaped.

812
00:51:53,213 --> 00:51:55,215
He heard that his wife
and family had fled

813
00:51:55,215 --> 00:51:56,716
and come to
this country.

814
00:51:56,716 --> 00:51:57,717
Does he know where?

815
00:51:57,717 --> 00:51:58,718
No.

816
00:51:58,718 --> 00:52:00,720
He has to find them.

817
00:52:01,221 --> 00:52:02,222
My love...

818
00:52:03,723 --> 00:52:05,725
when you say
your prayers

819
00:52:05,725 --> 00:52:10,730
ask God to take pity
on all prisoners and captives.

820
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:13,233
"Prisoners and captives."

821
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:26,246
(bird calling)

822
00:52:26,246 --> 00:52:29,249
But, if you have
your cake, of course
you can eat it.

823
00:52:29,249 --> 00:52:30,750
Yes, but the point is

824
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,752
once you've had it,
you can't eat it again.

825
00:52:32,752 --> 00:52:33,753
I know.

826
00:52:33,753 --> 00:52:34,754
So it should be.

827
00:52:34,754 --> 00:52:37,757
You can't eat your cake
and still have it.

828
00:52:37,757 --> 00:52:39,259
Unless you
only eat half.

829
00:52:41,261 --> 00:52:44,264
I hate Mr. Szczepansky
having to wear
Daddy's clothes.

830
00:52:44,264 --> 00:52:45,765
Yes, so does Mother.

831
00:52:45,765 --> 00:52:47,767
I can see it in her eyes.

832
00:52:47,767 --> 00:52:49,769
What's that noise?

833
00:52:49,769 --> 00:52:51,271
(wood cracking)

834
00:52:51,271 --> 00:52:54,774
Look at that tree
over there.

835
00:52:54,774 --> 00:52:56,776
It's moving.

836
00:52:56,776 --> 00:52:58,778
(tree cracking)

837
00:52:58,778 --> 00:52:59,779
It's magic.

838
00:53:03,283 --> 00:53:04,284
I don't like it anymore.

839
00:53:04,284 --> 00:53:06,286
Let's go home.

840
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:07,787
(trees cracking)

841
00:53:07,787 --> 00:53:09,789
(crash)

842
00:53:12,292 --> 00:53:13,793
That'll take some clearing up.

843
00:53:13,793 --> 00:53:15,295
It's right across the line.

844
00:53:16,796 --> 00:53:19,799
The 11:29 down
hasn't gone by yet.

845
00:53:19,799 --> 00:53:20,800
We must let them know
at the station

846
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,802
or there'll be
a terrible accident.

847
00:53:22,802 --> 00:53:23,803
Run.

848
00:53:26,806 --> 00:53:27,807
PETER:
Wait!

849
00:53:27,807 --> 00:53:28,308
Come back!

850
00:53:28,308 --> 00:53:32,312
There's no time!

851
00:53:32,312 --> 00:53:34,314
We should wave at
the train to stop it.

852
00:53:34,314 --> 00:53:38,318
They'll just think it's us
waving as we usually do.

853
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:39,819
We need something red.

854
00:53:42,322 --> 00:53:43,323
Let's take them off.

855
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:54,334
(trees cracking)

856
00:53:54,334 --> 00:53:55,835
(crash)

857
00:54:04,844 --> 00:54:05,845
Now.

858
00:54:05,845 --> 00:54:06,846
You're not going
to tear them?

859
00:54:06,846 --> 00:54:07,847
Shut up.

860
00:54:07,847 --> 00:54:09,349
It doesn't matter, Phil.

861
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:10,350
If we can't
stop the train

862
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:11,851
there'll be a
real accident

863
00:54:11,851 --> 00:54:13,353
with people smashed up
and killed.

864
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:20,860
Sticks.

865
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,862
We need sticks
to put the flags on.

866
00:54:37,877 --> 00:54:39,379
Stand firm and
wave like mad.

867
00:54:39,379 --> 00:54:40,880
When the train gets
round the corner

868
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,382
step back but
keep on waving.

869
00:54:42,382 --> 00:54:47,387
(train chugging)

870
00:54:47,387 --> 00:54:49,389
They can't see us,
it won't work.

871
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:52,392
It's no good.

872
00:54:52,392 --> 00:54:54,394
Keep off the line.

873
00:54:55,395 --> 00:54:57,897
Stop, stop!

874
00:54:58,898 --> 00:55:01,401
(train whistles)

875
00:55:01,401 --> 00:55:03,903
Please, stop!

876
00:55:03,903 --> 00:55:13,413
(brakes screech)

877
00:55:18,918 --> 00:55:19,919
Wake up, Bobbie.

878
00:55:19,919 --> 00:55:20,920
Bobbie?

879
00:55:22,422 --> 00:55:24,424
Speak to me, Bobbie.

880
00:55:38,938 --> 00:55:39,939
Good morning.

881
00:55:39,939 --> 00:55:41,941
Good morning.

882
00:55:41,941 --> 00:55:43,943
You sleep?

883
00:55:43,943 --> 00:55:44,944
Yes, thank you--

884
00:55:44,944 --> 00:55:45,945
like a log.

885
00:55:49,949 --> 00:55:51,951
Um, I, um...

886
00:55:51,951 --> 00:55:52,952
this...

887
00:55:54,954 --> 00:55:56,456
blackberry.

888
00:55:58,458 --> 00:55:59,459
Thank you.

889
00:56:02,462 --> 00:56:03,363
Be better.

890
00:56:04,864 --> 00:56:06,366
Thank you.

891
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:09,369
PHYLLIS:
Listen, we got a letter.

892
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:11,371
"...when a small
presentation will
be made to you

893
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:13,873
on behalf of
the Great Northern
and Southern Railway..."

894
00:56:13,873 --> 00:56:16,376
"...in commemoration
of your prompt and
courageous action

895
00:56:16,376 --> 00:56:18,378
in warning the train,
thus avert..."

896
00:56:22,382 --> 00:56:24,384
"...averting what must,
humanly speaking

897
00:56:24,884 --> 00:56:26,386
have been a
terrible accident."

898
00:56:26,386 --> 00:56:28,388
Does this mean
we get a present?

899
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:33,393
Not that
it's important.

900
00:56:33,393 --> 00:56:38,398
And so today we pay tribute
to Roberta, Peter and Phyllis

901
00:56:38,398 --> 00:56:40,400
for displaying
great bravery

902
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,901
and presence of mind.

903
00:56:41,901 --> 00:56:42,902
Hear, hear.

904
00:56:42,902 --> 00:56:49,909
(applause)

905
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:52,412
(whispered):
Make a speech and
thank everyone.

906
00:56:52,412 --> 00:56:53,913
Begin "Ladies
and gentlemen..."

907
00:56:53,913 --> 00:56:55,915
Nice and loud now,
you can't be too loud.

908
00:56:57,417 --> 00:56:59,419
(shouting):
Ladies and gentlemen...

909
00:56:59,419 --> 00:57:00,420
Too loud.

910
00:57:02,422 --> 00:57:03,923
This is awfully good of you.

911
00:57:03,923 --> 00:57:05,925
We don't deserve the watches

912
00:57:05,925 --> 00:57:08,928
because what we did
wasn't anything, really.

913
00:57:08,928 --> 00:57:11,431
It's just...

914
00:57:11,431 --> 00:57:13,433
I mean, it was
terribly exciting.

915
00:57:13,433 --> 00:57:14,934
(crowd laughs)

916
00:57:14,934 --> 00:57:16,936
PETER:
So, thank you all

917
00:57:16,936 --> 00:57:18,438
very, very, very much.

918
00:57:18,438 --> 00:57:24,944
(crowd applauds)

919
00:57:25,945 --> 00:57:27,947
We meet properly, at last.

920
00:57:27,947 --> 00:57:29,449
Yes.

921
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:32,952
As a director of the railway,
permit me to say--

922
00:57:32,952 --> 00:57:33,953
bravo.

923
00:57:33,953 --> 00:57:35,455
Thank you.

924
00:57:35,955 --> 00:57:37,457
Would you think it
terribly rude

925
00:57:37,457 --> 00:57:38,958
if I... if I have
a favor to ask?

926
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:39,959
No.

927
00:57:39,959 --> 00:57:41,461
Excuse me, sir.

928
00:57:41,461 --> 00:57:42,462
Um, photographs?

929
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:45,465
Of course.

930
00:57:48,968 --> 00:57:50,970
Afternoon tea.

931
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:52,472
Very handsome.

932
00:57:52,472 --> 00:57:55,475
Oh, well, this is very
thoughtful of you.

933
00:57:56,476 --> 00:57:58,478
I had an accident
with the lemonade.

934
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:00,480
A cup and a plate might be nice.

935
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,982
Perks always drinks it
out of the can.

936
00:58:04,484 --> 00:58:06,986
Yes, um...

937
00:58:13,993 --> 00:58:15,495
Mmm.

938
00:58:15,495 --> 00:58:16,996
OLD GENTLEMAN:
Well, in a minute

939
00:58:16,996 --> 00:58:17,997
I want to hear all about you

940
00:58:17,997 --> 00:58:19,499
but what was that
favor you wanted?

941
00:58:19,999 --> 00:58:21,501
Um...

942
00:58:23,503 --> 00:58:25,505
Do you know anything
about Russia?

943
00:58:28,508 --> 00:58:30,009
Russia?

944
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:34,013
(birds singing)

945
00:58:34,013 --> 00:58:35,515
Anybody want
to know the time?

946
00:58:35,515 --> 00:58:36,516
GIRLS:
No, thank you.

947
00:58:36,516 --> 00:58:38,518
3:18.

948
00:58:39,018 --> 00:58:41,521
This is a bit like the Victoria
Cross really, isn't it?

949
00:58:41,521 --> 00:58:43,022
When I'm very old

950
00:58:43,022 --> 00:58:45,024
I shall show it
to my grandchildren.

951
00:58:45,024 --> 00:58:47,527
You have to be married
to have grandchildren.

952
00:58:47,527 --> 00:58:50,530
I suppose I'll have
to get married, someday.

953
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:53,533
I'd like to marry a lady
who had trances

954
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:55,034
and only woke up
once or twice a year.

955
00:58:55,034 --> 00:58:59,038
When I get married, I want him
to be awake all the time

956
00:58:59,038 --> 00:59:00,540
to tell me how nice I am.

957
00:59:02,041 --> 00:59:03,543
(horse whinnies)

958
00:59:18,057 --> 00:59:20,059
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

959
00:59:24,564 --> 00:59:25,565
OLD GENTLEMAN:
Good afternoon.

960
00:59:25,565 --> 00:59:26,566
Good afternoon.

961
00:59:26,566 --> 00:59:27,567
Thank you, Mr. Perks.

962
00:59:27,567 --> 00:59:29,068
PERKS:
Don't mention it.

963
00:59:29,068 --> 00:59:33,072
Always a pleasure
to carry a director
of the railway--

964
00:59:33,072 --> 00:59:35,575
if that doesn't
sound too oily.

965
00:59:35,575 --> 00:59:37,577
No, no, no, most,
most gracious.

966
00:59:37,577 --> 00:59:39,078
Good news.

967
00:59:39,078 --> 00:59:42,081
You've found
Mr. Szczepansky's
wife and children.

968
00:59:42,081 --> 00:59:44,584
And I couldn't resist
the pleasure of coming
to tell him myself.

969
00:59:47,086 --> 00:59:49,088
Oh...

970
00:59:49,088 --> 00:59:51,090
Well, on, on, on
second thoughts you...

971
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:53,092
you run ahead
and tell him.

972
00:59:53,092 --> 00:59:55,094
These two'll
look after me.

973
00:59:55,094 --> 00:59:56,095
Come with us.

974
00:59:56,095 --> 00:59:58,598
Thank you.

975
00:59:58,598 --> 01:00:01,100
OLD GENTLEMAN:
Well, I must say
I think everything's

976
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,602
worked out very
well, hasn't it?

977
01:00:02,602 --> 01:00:05,605
Come on, Perky,
you must come, too.

978
01:00:05,605 --> 01:00:07,607
Don't call me Perky.

979
01:00:07,607 --> 01:00:09,108
Sorry.

980
01:00:09,108 --> 01:00:11,110
PERKS:
Oh, it's
all right

981
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:12,612
you weren't to know.

982
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:21,621
MOTHER:
This is another one
of the letters I wrote.

983
01:00:22,622 --> 01:00:23,623
We know where your wife

984
01:00:23,623 --> 01:00:25,625
and children are!

985
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:27,627
(gasps)

986
01:00:28,127 --> 01:00:30,630
(breathing excitedly)

987
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:44,143
Khranemos Bog-- Ya vas prosil

988
01:00:44,143 --> 01:00:49,649
shto vy priyekhali
i posetril moi semyu.

989
01:00:49,649 --> 01:00:50,650
Do svedanya.

990
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:52,652
Do svedanya,
do svedanya.

991
01:00:52,652 --> 01:00:55,655
I don't know how
to thank you for...
everything.

992
01:00:55,655 --> 01:00:57,657
It's been
a real pleasure
to meet you.

993
01:00:58,157 --> 01:00:59,659
I'm afraid we live
rather simply

994
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:03,162
in reduced
circumstances.

995
01:01:03,162 --> 01:01:05,164
I'm so sorry I...
I can't ask you

996
01:01:05,164 --> 01:01:06,666
to come and
see us again.

997
01:01:06,666 --> 01:01:10,169
Oh, I consider myself
fortunate indeed

998
01:01:10,169 --> 01:01:14,173
to have been
received once
at your house.

999
01:01:14,173 --> 01:01:18,177
I'm sorry, I must seem...
so surly and ungrateful.

1000
01:01:18,177 --> 01:01:21,180
You could never
seem anything...

1001
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:22,682
but most gracious
and charming.

1002
01:01:22,682 --> 01:01:23,683
SZCEPANSKY:
Do svedanya,
do svedanya.

1003
01:01:23,683 --> 01:01:25,685
Perks!

1004
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:32,191
Thank you,
thank you.

1005
01:01:32,191 --> 01:01:34,694
Good-bye.

1006
01:01:34,694 --> 01:01:36,195
Please, please,
please, no.

1007
01:01:36,195 --> 01:01:38,197
No, the... the wife
can get very jealous.

1008
01:01:38,197 --> 01:01:40,700
(chuckling):
It can actually turn
quite ugly, you know.

1009
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:41,701
Thank you,
again.

1010
01:01:41,701 --> 01:01:42,702
Walk on.

1011
01:01:45,204 --> 01:01:46,205
Bye.

1012
01:01:46,205 --> 01:01:47,206
Bye.

1013
01:01:47,206 --> 01:01:48,207
Szcepansky:
Bye... bye.

1014
01:01:48,207 --> 01:01:50,209
BOBBIE:
Bye.

1015
01:01:53,212 --> 01:01:54,714
I wonder if
Daddy'll be
that excited

1016
01:01:54,714 --> 01:01:58,217
when he comes
home to us.

1017
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,221
You look
tired, Mummy.

1018
01:02:02,221 --> 01:02:03,222
Lean on me.

1019
01:02:03,222 --> 01:02:04,724
(sighs)

1020
01:02:04,724 --> 01:02:06,726
No, it's my
place to give
Mother my arm.

1021
01:02:06,726 --> 01:02:08,227
Now Father's
not here

1022
01:02:08,227 --> 01:02:09,729
I'm the head
of the family.

1023
01:02:28,748 --> 01:02:36,756
(birds singing, cawing)

1024
01:02:44,764 --> 01:02:47,767
All:
? Our darling Roberta ?

1025
01:02:47,767 --> 01:02:50,269
? No sorrow shall hurt her ?

1026
01:02:50,269 --> 01:02:56,275
? If we can prevent it
her whole life long ?

1027
01:02:56,275 --> 01:02:59,278
? Her birthday's our fete day ?

1028
01:02:59,278 --> 01:03:02,281
? We'll make it a great day ?

1029
01:03:02,281 --> 01:03:04,283
? And give her our presents ?

1030
01:03:04,283 --> 01:03:08,287
? And sing her song. ?

1031
01:03:11,957 --> 01:03:13,459
Oh, happy birthday,
darling.

1032
01:03:13,459 --> 01:03:14,960
Thank you.

1033
01:03:15,961 --> 01:03:17,463
This is my present.

1034
01:03:17,463 --> 01:03:19,465
It's pencils again.

1035
01:03:19,465 --> 01:03:21,967
(chuckling):
Thank you, Phil.

1036
01:03:21,967 --> 01:03:23,469
This is
my present.

1037
01:03:23,469 --> 01:03:25,471
Oh, Peter...

1038
01:03:25,471 --> 01:03:29,475
Not your own dear engine
that you're so fond of.

1039
01:03:29,475 --> 01:03:32,478
That is so
kind and generous.

1040
01:03:32,478 --> 01:03:34,980
No...

1041
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:35,981
not the engine...

1042
01:03:35,981 --> 01:03:36,982
just the sweets.

1043
01:03:39,485 --> 01:03:41,987
Oh, of course,
that's what I
thought you meant.

1044
01:03:41,987 --> 01:03:44,490
I'll go halves on
the engine if you like.

1045
01:03:45,991 --> 01:03:47,493
Oh, Peter, thank you.

1046
01:03:47,993 --> 01:03:48,994
It's a splendid present.

1047
01:03:48,994 --> 01:03:51,497
But it's broken.

1048
01:03:51,497 --> 01:03:53,499
(chuckling)

1049
01:03:53,499 --> 01:04:00,506
(steam hissing)

1050
01:04:00,506 --> 01:04:01,507
MAN:
What's wrong?

1051
01:04:01,507 --> 01:04:03,008
You're gonna
be late again.

1052
01:04:03,008 --> 01:04:05,010
Man 2:
Yeah, well, we'll start
running on time...

1053
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:06,011
BOBBIE:
Excuse me.

1054
01:04:06,011 --> 01:04:07,513
when you stop
dropping luggage.

1055
01:04:07,513 --> 01:04:08,514
Man 1:
You've got it all wrong.

1056
01:04:08,514 --> 01:04:09,515
Get that kettle
out of here.

1057
01:04:09,515 --> 01:04:10,516
Man 2:
It's going.

1058
01:04:10,516 --> 01:04:12,017
(steam hissing increasing)

1059
01:04:12,518 --> 01:04:14,520
If you please, Mr. Engineer!

1060
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:18,524
(train begins chugging)

1061
01:04:18,524 --> 01:04:21,026
(train chugging grows faster)

1062
01:04:21,026 --> 01:04:22,528
What the bloomin'...?

1063
01:04:22,528 --> 01:04:23,529
What are you
doing here?

1064
01:04:23,529 --> 01:04:24,530
Come on!

1065
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:26,532
(shrieks)

1066
01:04:26,532 --> 01:04:28,033
Sit there!

1067
01:04:31,537 --> 01:04:34,039
(train rumbling increases)

1068
01:04:56,061 --> 01:04:57,062
Come on, then.

1069
01:04:57,062 --> 01:04:58,564
What's it all about?

1070
01:04:58,564 --> 01:05:02,067
I did call out but
you didn't hear me!

1071
01:05:02,067 --> 01:05:03,068
Don't be cross, please.

1072
01:05:03,068 --> 01:05:04,570
We ain't cross
as much as interested.

1073
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:09,074
I only thought... you could mend
this because you're an engineer.

1074
01:05:09,074 --> 01:05:11,577
Well, I'm blowed.

1075
01:05:11,577 --> 01:05:13,579
BOBBIE:
I felt guilty

1076
01:05:13,579 --> 01:05:16,081
because my brother Peter gave it
to me and didn't really mean it

1077
01:05:16,081 --> 01:05:18,083
so I wanted to make
amends by repairing it.

1078
01:05:19,084 --> 01:05:21,086
We drive the engine,
we don't mend her.

1079
01:05:21,086 --> 01:05:23,088
And how are we
gonna get you back

1080
01:05:23,088 --> 01:05:24,089
to your
sorrowing

1081
01:05:24,089 --> 01:05:26,091
friends
and relations?

1082
01:05:26,091 --> 01:05:27,593
Well...

1083
01:05:27,593 --> 01:05:30,596
if you put me down
next time you stop and...

1084
01:05:30,596 --> 01:05:34,099
lend me the fare for a third-
class ticket, I'll pay you back.

1085
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,603
BOBBIE:
I'm not a confidence
trickster, honestly!

1086
01:05:37,603 --> 01:05:41,106
(laughing)

1087
01:05:41,106 --> 01:05:43,108
Here, Nat, ain't
you got a pal

1088
01:05:43,108 --> 01:05:44,610
who can use a
soldering iron?

1089
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:46,111
Yeah, I have.

1090
01:05:46,111 --> 01:05:48,614
That's what Father
said it needed.

1091
01:05:58,624 --> 01:06:00,626
Gosh...

1092
01:06:00,626 --> 01:06:02,127
Who did you
get to do it?

1093
01:06:02,127 --> 01:06:05,130
Nat, the fireman's
second cousin's
wife's brother.

1094
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:08,133
Very good chap,
very good chap indeed.

1095
01:06:08,133 --> 01:06:10,135
Oh, it's like
having my birthday
all over again.

1096
01:06:10,135 --> 01:06:11,637
Thank you, Bobbie.

1097
01:06:12,638 --> 01:06:14,139
When's your
birthday, Mr. Perks?

1098
01:06:14,139 --> 01:06:17,643
The 15th of this month,
if you really want to know.

1099
01:06:17,643 --> 01:06:20,145
But I gave up keeping
birthdays years ago.

1100
01:06:20,145 --> 01:06:21,647
Before you were born.

1101
01:06:22,147 --> 01:06:23,148
Why?

1102
01:06:23,148 --> 01:06:26,652
Well...

1103
01:06:27,152 --> 01:06:28,153
I'm too busy...

1104
01:06:28,153 --> 01:06:30,656
looking after...
looking after

1105
01:06:30,656 --> 01:06:33,158
the missus
and the bairns.

1106
01:06:33,158 --> 01:06:34,159
His wife
and children.

1107
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:35,160
I know.

1108
01:06:35,661 --> 01:06:37,663
Perky...

1109
01:06:40,666 --> 01:06:44,169
Pete... Phil... porridge!

1110
01:06:44,169 --> 01:06:45,671
Good news.

1111
01:06:45,671 --> 01:06:46,672
I've sold another story.

1112
01:06:46,672 --> 01:06:47,673
You know something?

1113
01:06:47,673 --> 01:06:49,675
I'm getting good at this.

1114
01:06:49,675 --> 01:06:51,677
Buns for tea?

1115
01:06:51,677 --> 01:06:52,678
Mother, would you mind

1116
01:06:52,678 --> 01:06:54,680
if we didn't have
our buns for tea tonight

1117
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,682
but on the 15th,
next Thursday?

1118
01:06:56,682 --> 01:06:58,183
No, of course
not, but why?

1119
01:06:58,183 --> 01:06:59,685
It's Mr. Perks's
birthday.

1120
01:06:59,685 --> 01:07:01,186
He's been really
friendly to us

1121
01:07:01,186 --> 01:07:02,688
and we wanted
to give him our buns.

1122
01:07:02,688 --> 01:07:05,190
Certainly.

1123
01:07:06,692 --> 01:07:09,194
Come on,
we must think.

1124
01:07:09,194 --> 01:07:10,195
We could just
give him the buns.

1125
01:07:10,696 --> 01:07:12,698
No...
It's not enough.

1126
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,201
I know...

1127
01:07:16,201 --> 01:07:19,204
Perks is so
nice to everybody

1128
01:07:19,204 --> 01:07:21,206
there must be lots
of people in the village

1129
01:07:21,206 --> 01:07:22,708
who'd like to help
give him a good birthday.

1130
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:24,209
Let's go round
and ask everybody.

1131
01:07:24,209 --> 01:07:27,713
Mother said we weren't
to ask people for things.

1132
01:07:27,713 --> 01:07:30,716
For ourselves, she meant,
not for other people.

1133
01:07:31,717 --> 01:07:32,718
We should ask her first.

1134
01:07:32,718 --> 01:07:36,221
What's the point in bothering
Mother for everything?

1135
01:07:41,727 --> 01:07:45,230
Given: pram,
Mrs. Ransome.

1136
01:07:45,731 --> 01:07:48,233
Half a pound of tea
from the grocer.

1137
01:07:48,233 --> 01:07:52,738
Woolen scarf,
slightly faded,
from the draper's.

1138
01:07:52,738 --> 01:07:54,740
A stuffed squirrel
from the doctor.

1139
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:56,241
Promised: a piece
of honeycomb

1140
01:07:56,241 --> 01:07:58,243
and six bootlaces
from the cobbler.

1141
01:07:58,243 --> 01:08:01,246
Uh, an iron shovel
from the blacksmith.

1142
01:08:01,246 --> 01:08:02,247
Anything else?

1143
01:08:02,247 --> 01:08:04,249
A slab of meat
from the butcher.

1144
01:08:04,249 --> 01:08:06,251
Ah, yes, we can pick
that up on the way.

1145
01:08:06,251 --> 01:08:07,252
Oops.

1146
01:08:07,252 --> 01:08:09,254
Peter (annoyed):
Oh, Phil.

1147
01:08:13,759 --> 01:08:14,760
Ooh!

1148
01:08:27,272 --> 01:08:29,274
Boy:
Where are they going?

1149
01:08:36,281 --> 01:08:37,282
(knocking)

1150
01:08:40,786 --> 01:08:42,788
Mother's
changing herself.

1151
01:08:42,788 --> 01:08:44,289
MRS. PERKS:
Down in a minute.

1152
01:08:44,289 --> 01:08:45,791
She'll be down
in a minute.

1153
01:08:51,296 --> 01:08:52,798
MRS. PERKS:
Good boy, Arthur.

1154
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:54,299
You put her in the cart.

1155
01:08:54,299 --> 01:08:55,300
Hello, hello.

1156
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:57,302
MRS. PERKS:
I'm a bit
late, um...

1157
01:08:57,302 --> 01:08:59,304
changing 'cause I done
an extra clean-up, it being...

1158
01:08:59,304 --> 01:09:00,305
well, it being Perks's birthday.

1159
01:09:02,307 --> 01:09:03,308
We knew it
was his birthday

1160
01:09:03,308 --> 01:09:04,810
so we've brought
him some presents.

1161
01:09:07,813 --> 01:09:08,814
PETER:
What's the matter?

1162
01:09:08,814 --> 01:09:10,315
Don't you
like them?

1163
01:09:11,817 --> 01:09:12,818
Like them?

1164
01:09:12,818 --> 01:09:13,819
Of course I do.

1165
01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:15,320
You're so kind.

1166
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,823
Perks has never
had a birthday like it...

1167
01:09:19,825 --> 01:09:21,326
not even when he was a boy.

1168
01:09:21,326 --> 01:09:23,328
I mean, look
at it, Arthur

1169
01:09:23,328 --> 01:09:25,831
it, well, it's
fit for a prince.

1170
01:09:25,831 --> 01:09:27,833
Not that he is a prince.

1171
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:28,834
(man whistling)

1172
01:09:28,834 --> 01:09:30,836
Oh, bless us, he's early.

1173
01:09:30,836 --> 01:09:34,339
Let's hide in
the washroom.

1174
01:09:38,343 --> 01:09:39,344
You tell him
about it...

1175
01:09:39,344 --> 01:09:40,345
and then
we'll come in

1176
01:09:40,345 --> 01:09:41,346
and shout "Many
Happy Returns."

1177
01:09:41,346 --> 01:09:42,347
Righto.

1178
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:49,354
(whistling grows louder)

1179
01:09:50,355 --> 01:09:51,356
Hello.

1180
01:09:51,356 --> 01:09:52,858
(door closes)

1181
01:09:53,859 --> 01:09:55,861
Oh, here's
a pretty spread.

1182
01:09:55,861 --> 01:09:58,363
It's your
birthday tea, Bert.

1183
01:09:58,363 --> 01:09:59,364
Where's the children?

1184
01:09:59,364 --> 01:10:00,866
Mrs. Parks:
I couldn't say.

1185
01:10:00,866 --> 01:10:03,535
PERKS:
Go on then, give
us a big sloppy one.

1186
01:10:03,535 --> 01:10:04,536
(giggling)

1187
01:10:07,539 --> 01:10:09,041
What's that
pram doing there

1188
01:10:09,041 --> 01:10:10,542
and all these...
things?

1189
01:10:10,542 --> 01:10:12,044
Well...

1190
01:10:12,044 --> 01:10:14,546
Oh, no... I hope
he doesn't think

1191
01:10:14,546 --> 01:10:16,048
it's all
come from us

1192
01:10:16,048 --> 01:10:18,550
and that we're
trying to be grand.

1193
01:10:21,053 --> 01:10:22,554
I... I don't care who it's from.

1194
01:10:22,554 --> 01:10:24,556
I'm not gonna start
these charity goings-on

1195
01:10:24,556 --> 01:10:25,557
at my time of life.

1196
01:10:26,058 --> 01:10:27,059
Oh, Bert, hush,
for goodness' sake.

1197
01:10:27,559 --> 01:10:28,560
They're in the washroom.

1198
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,561
They can hear
everything you say.

1199
01:10:29,561 --> 01:10:31,063
Well, I'll give
them something
to listen to.

1200
01:10:32,564 --> 01:10:34,066
Come out!
Come out!

1201
01:10:35,567 --> 01:10:37,569
Come out here
and tell me what...

1202
01:10:37,569 --> 01:10:39,571
what you
mean by this?

1203
01:10:39,571 --> 01:10:41,573
Have I ever complained
about being short enough

1204
01:10:41,573 --> 01:10:43,075
as to need
charity?

1205
01:10:43,075 --> 01:10:44,576
We thought
you'd be pleased.

1206
01:10:44,576 --> 01:10:46,078
I'll never be
kind to anyone

1207
01:10:46,078 --> 01:10:48,580
as long
as I live.

1208
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:50,082
We didn't
mean any harm.

1209
01:10:50,082 --> 01:10:52,084
It's not what
you mean, it's
what you do.

1210
01:10:52,084 --> 01:10:53,585
Oh, don't.

1211
01:10:53,585 --> 01:10:55,087
We thought you'd love it.

1212
01:10:55,087 --> 01:10:57,589
BOBBIE:
We always have things
on our birthdays.

1213
01:10:57,589 --> 01:10:59,591
From your relatives...

1214
01:10:59,591 --> 01:11:01,093
That's different!

1215
01:11:01,093 --> 01:11:02,594
And look at it all,
look at it.

1216
01:11:03,095 --> 01:11:04,096
There's far too much.

1217
01:11:04,096 --> 01:11:06,598
It's not all
from us.

1218
01:11:06,598 --> 01:11:08,600
We forgot to put
the labels on.

1219
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,603
It's from all
sorts of people
in the village.

1220
01:11:11,603 --> 01:11:13,105
Bert, please.

1221
01:11:13,105 --> 01:11:14,106
Have you been
going round

1222
01:11:14,106 --> 01:11:16,608
telling the neighbors
we can't make ends meet?

1223
01:11:16,608 --> 01:11:19,611
Well, you can take back
this whole bag of tricks

1224
01:11:19,611 --> 01:11:20,612
to where it came from!

1225
01:11:20,612 --> 01:11:23,615
And I would rather
not be acquainted

1226
01:11:23,615 --> 01:11:24,616
with you any longer--

1227
01:11:24,616 --> 01:11:25,617
if it's all
the same to you.

1228
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:31,123
Look... we'll
go if you like

1229
01:11:31,123 --> 01:11:33,625
and you needn't
be friends with
us anymore

1230
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:35,127
if you
don't want to.

1231
01:11:35,127 --> 01:11:36,628
We'll always be
friends with you...

1232
01:11:36,628 --> 01:11:38,130
however nasty
you are to us.

1233
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:39,131
Shh!

1234
01:11:39,131 --> 01:11:40,632
But before we go,
let us show you

1235
01:11:40,632 --> 01:11:42,634
the labels we meant
to put on the things.

1236
01:11:42,634 --> 01:11:44,136
I don't want to see any labels.

1237
01:11:44,136 --> 01:11:46,138
I see enough labels
at work, on luggage.

1238
01:11:46,138 --> 01:11:48,140
We wrote down
what everyone said

1239
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:49,641
when they gave
us the things.

1240
01:11:50,142 --> 01:11:51,143
Don't you upset yourself.

1241
01:11:51,143 --> 01:11:54,646
I know you meant it kindly,
even if he doesn't!

1242
01:11:57,649 --> 01:11:58,650
(both sighing)

1243
01:11:59,151 --> 01:12:01,153
Mother's label first.

1244
01:12:01,153 --> 01:12:04,656
It says: "Little clothes
for Mrs. Perks's children.

1245
01:12:04,656 --> 01:12:09,161
"I can't do much
because we're
poor ourselves

1246
01:12:09,161 --> 01:12:10,162
"but I'd like to do something

1247
01:12:10,162 --> 01:12:11,663
because he's
so friendly to you".

1248
01:12:13,165 --> 01:12:15,167
Well, that's different.

1249
01:12:15,167 --> 01:12:17,169
Your mother's
a born lady.

1250
01:12:17,169 --> 01:12:20,172
We'll keep the frocks
and whatnot, Nell.

1251
01:12:20,172 --> 01:12:23,175
The pram's
from Mrs. Ransome.

1252
01:12:23,175 --> 01:12:25,677
"It was bought
for my daughter's first.

1253
01:12:25,677 --> 01:12:28,680
"But sadly he
died and she
never had another.

1254
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:31,183
It would be a help
for Mrs. Perks's little girl."

1255
01:12:31,183 --> 01:12:33,185
I'm not sending the pram
back, so don't ask me.

1256
01:12:33,185 --> 01:12:36,188
I'm not asking you anything.

1257
01:12:36,188 --> 01:12:39,691
Mr. James made the
shovel for you himself.

1258
01:12:39,691 --> 01:12:43,195
"You tell Mr. Perks
it's a pleasure

1259
01:12:43,195 --> 01:12:48,200
to make something
for a man who's
so much respected."

1260
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,702
I thought you'd
love to know

1261
01:12:50,702 --> 01:12:53,205
how fond people
are of you.

1262
01:12:53,205 --> 01:12:57,209
I've never been so
unhappy in my life.

1263
01:12:57,209 --> 01:12:58,210
Good-bye.

1264
01:13:06,218 --> 01:13:08,720
All right... all right.

1265
01:13:10,722 --> 01:13:12,224
I take it all back.

1266
01:13:12,224 --> 01:13:14,726
Everything I said
that you don't like.

1267
01:13:14,726 --> 01:13:16,728
Nell...

1268
01:13:16,728 --> 01:13:19,231
put the kettle on.

1269
01:13:20,232 --> 01:13:21,233
Arthur, stop

1270
01:13:21,233 --> 01:13:22,234
picking your nose!

1271
01:13:23,735 --> 01:13:25,237
I knew you'd
like them

1272
01:13:25,237 --> 01:13:27,239
once you really
understood.

1273
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:29,741
I'm... I'm not unhappy
about the presents.

1274
01:13:29,741 --> 01:13:32,244
I mean, well, they're
an A-1 collection.

1275
01:13:32,244 --> 01:13:35,247
I'm... I'm just...

1276
01:13:35,247 --> 01:13:38,750
I'm just pleased at having the
kind respect of our neighbors.

1277
01:13:39,251 --> 01:13:40,752
(Perks sniffles)

1278
01:13:40,752 --> 01:13:43,755
You are the most
aggravating man.

1279
01:13:43,755 --> 01:13:46,258
A man must respect himself

1280
01:13:46,258 --> 01:13:49,261
otherwise no one else
will do it for him.

1281
01:13:49,261 --> 01:13:50,762
So...

1282
01:13:50,762 --> 01:13:52,264
staying to tea?

1283
01:13:53,765 --> 01:13:56,768
(children playing
and chattering)

1284
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:10,282
PERKS:
Right, well,
good-bye.

1285
01:14:10,282 --> 01:14:12,284
CHILDREN:
Good-bye.

1286
01:14:21,293 --> 01:14:22,794
(annoyed):
Phil...

1287
01:14:22,794 --> 01:14:24,296
PHYLLIS:
Peter, wait.

1288
01:14:24,296 --> 01:14:25,797
(door opens and closes)

1289
01:14:25,797 --> 01:14:28,300
(Peter and Phyllis
playing outside)

1290
01:14:34,306 --> 01:14:36,308
Bobbie, dear...

1291
01:14:39,311 --> 01:14:42,814
Parting from Father
was terrible.

1292
01:14:42,814 --> 01:14:45,817
Much worse than anything
you can think of.

1293
01:14:45,817 --> 01:14:47,819
But it'd be much
more terrible

1294
01:14:47,819 --> 01:14:48,820
if you children

1295
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:49,821
were to forget him.

1296
01:14:49,821 --> 01:14:50,822
You aren't, are you?

1297
01:14:50,822 --> 01:14:53,325
No... why?

1298
01:14:53,325 --> 01:14:55,827
You never speak of him now.

1299
01:14:58,830 --> 01:15:00,332
Well, I...

1300
01:15:00,832 --> 01:15:02,834
I thought
you were so unhappy

1301
01:15:02,834 --> 01:15:05,337
about Daddy not being here.

1302
01:15:05,337 --> 01:15:08,340
It made it worse when
you talked about him

1303
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:09,841
so I stopped--
we all did.

1304
01:15:13,345 --> 01:15:15,347
I promised myself
I'd never ask you questions

1305
01:15:15,347 --> 01:15:16,848
and I never have, have I?

1306
01:15:20,352 --> 01:15:24,856
But the trouble...
it won't last forever, will it?

1307
01:15:27,859 --> 01:15:28,860
No.

1308
01:15:44,876 --> 01:15:46,878
PERKS:
What's this?

1309
01:15:46,878 --> 01:15:48,380
A pretty young girl on a swing.

1310
01:15:52,384 --> 01:15:53,385
I've, uh...

1311
01:15:53,385 --> 01:15:55,387
I've brought you some magazines

1312
01:15:55,387 --> 01:15:57,889
by way of a thank-you
for my birthday presents.

1313
01:15:57,889 --> 01:15:59,391
Don't read them
all at once now--

1314
01:15:59,391 --> 01:16:00,892
they rot your brain.

1315
01:16:00,892 --> 01:16:02,894
Thank you very much,
Mr. Perks.

1316
01:16:02,894 --> 01:16:04,896
Oh, don't thank me--
people leave them
on the trains.

1317
01:16:04,896 --> 01:16:06,398
I wish they'd
leave something

1318
01:16:06,398 --> 01:16:09,401
a bit more useful
like cakes, huh?

1319
01:16:09,401 --> 01:16:10,402
Oh, well...

1320
01:16:10,402 --> 01:16:11,903
would you like
a cup of tea, Mr. Perks?

1321
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:14,406
Uh, no, no, no,
I'd best not.

1322
01:16:14,406 --> 01:16:16,908
No offense,
but I hear your house

1323
01:16:16,908 --> 01:16:19,411
has a wee bit
of a rat problem.

1324
01:16:22,414 --> 01:16:24,416
Good-bye.

1325
01:16:24,416 --> 01:16:26,418
Good-bye.

1326
01:16:30,922 --> 01:16:33,425
PETER:
Brilliant!

1327
01:16:46,938 --> 01:16:48,940
Oh, Daddy, it's not true.

1328
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:51,443
You never did it.

1329
01:16:51,943 --> 01:16:52,944
Never.

1330
01:17:14,165 --> 01:17:16,167
MOTHER:
Oh, Bobbie,
you don't believe it?

1331
01:17:16,167 --> 01:17:17,669
You don't believe
Daddy did it?

1332
01:17:17,669 --> 01:17:18,670
Of course not, Mother!

1333
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:20,672
They've shut him
up in prison

1334
01:17:20,672 --> 01:17:22,173
but he's done
nothing wrong.

1335
01:17:22,173 --> 01:17:23,174
He's good and honorable.

1336
01:17:23,174 --> 01:17:25,677
And we must
be proud of him and wait.

1337
01:17:25,677 --> 01:17:27,679
Why didn't you tell me?!

1338
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,682
Are you
going to tell
the others?

1339
01:17:30,682 --> 01:17:32,684
No.

1340
01:17:33,685 --> 01:17:34,686
Well...

1341
01:17:36,688 --> 01:17:41,192
So, how... how can this happen?

1342
01:17:44,195 --> 01:17:45,697
Don't be angry with me, my love.

1343
01:17:48,199 --> 01:17:50,201
But you didn't do anything.

1344
01:17:50,201 --> 01:17:53,705
You just
brought us down here.

1345
01:17:53,705 --> 01:17:56,708
We should have...

1346
01:17:56,708 --> 01:18:00,211
stood outside Buckingham Palace
in the rain and the cold

1347
01:18:00,211 --> 01:18:01,713
until they let him out!

1348
01:18:01,713 --> 01:18:03,715
(sobbing)

1349
01:18:14,726 --> 01:18:16,728
Tell me about it.

1350
01:18:16,728 --> 01:18:19,230
I want to understand.

1351
01:18:21,232 --> 01:18:23,234
I'll tell you, my love.

1352
01:18:25,737 --> 01:18:28,740
But then we won't
speak of it anymore.

1353
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:31,743
We must bear it
and be brave.

1354
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:42,253
BOBBIE:
"My dear friend, you see
what is in this paper.

1355
01:18:42,253 --> 01:18:44,255
"It is not true.

1356
01:18:44,255 --> 01:18:46,758
"Father is not a spy
or a traitor.

1357
01:18:46,758 --> 01:18:49,260
"Mother says the man
under him was jealous

1358
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:51,763
"and put the stolen papers
in Father's desk.

1359
01:18:51,763 --> 01:18:53,765
"Nobody listens
to a word Mother says

1360
01:18:53,765 --> 01:18:57,268
"but you were good and clever,
and you quickly found out

1361
01:18:57,268 --> 01:18:59,270
"about the Russian
gentleman's wife.

1362
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:02,774
"Can't you find out about
who did the treason?

1363
01:19:02,774 --> 01:19:05,276
"Because Father
is a true Englishman

1364
01:19:05,276 --> 01:19:08,279
"and incapable
of doing such things.

1365
01:19:08,279 --> 01:19:11,282
"It is dreadful--
Mother is getting so thin.

1366
01:19:11,282 --> 01:19:12,784
"Please help me.

1367
01:19:12,784 --> 01:19:15,787
"There is just Mother and me
who know,

1368
01:19:15,787 --> 01:19:17,789
and we can't do anything.

1369
01:19:17,789 --> 01:19:21,793
With love, your affectionate
friend, Roberta."

1370
01:19:36,808 --> 01:19:39,310
(hammer blows echoing)

1371
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:42,313
I like watching
people work.

1372
01:19:42,313 --> 01:19:43,815
No, Phyllis.

1373
01:19:43,815 --> 01:19:44,816
Look!

1374
01:19:55,827 --> 01:19:57,328
Oi!

1375
01:19:57,328 --> 01:19:59,831
Workman:
Naw, leave him,
leave him alone.

1376
01:19:59,831 --> 01:20:01,833
Oh, yes, it's the boys
from Maidbridge School

1377
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:02,834
doing a paper chase.

1378
01:20:03,334 --> 01:20:04,335
Oh, that's
really exciting.

1379
01:20:05,837 --> 01:20:07,839
But what's
a paper chase?

1380
01:20:07,839 --> 01:20:10,341
That first boy,
he's called the "hare"

1381
01:20:10,341 --> 01:20:12,343
and he has to leave
a trail of paper

1382
01:20:12,343 --> 01:20:13,845
for the "hounds"
to follow.

1383
01:20:13,845 --> 01:20:15,346
Go on,
you hounds!

1384
01:20:16,347 --> 01:20:19,851
(footsteps echoing)

1385
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:29,861
Let's cut across
the top

1386
01:20:29,861 --> 01:20:30,862
and can watch them

1387
01:20:30,862 --> 01:20:31,863
coming out
the other end.

1388
01:20:31,863 --> 01:20:32,864
Well, won't
they beat us?

1389
01:20:32,864 --> 01:20:34,365
No, we'll be
running on grass

1390
01:20:34,365 --> 01:20:35,867
they'll be running
in the dark.

1391
01:20:51,883 --> 01:20:53,384
PETER:
This way!

1392
01:20:53,384 --> 01:20:54,886
Follow me!

1393
01:20:54,886 --> 01:20:56,387
My boot lace
is undone.

1394
01:20:56,387 --> 01:20:57,388
Phyllis...

1395
01:20:57,889 --> 01:20:58,890
Can you
see them yet?

1396
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:00,391
No!

1397
01:21:01,392 --> 01:21:02,393
Crouch down.

1398
01:21:10,902 --> 01:21:12,403
PHYLLIS:
We must have missed them.

1399
01:21:12,403 --> 01:21:14,405
No, I don't think so.

1400
01:21:14,405 --> 01:21:15,406
Never mind.

1401
01:21:15,406 --> 01:21:16,407
We've never
seen a train

1402
01:21:16,407 --> 01:21:17,408
from up here before.

1403
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:20,912
Hey, look out,
here he comes.

1404
01:21:34,926 --> 01:21:36,928
BOBBIE:
There.

1405
01:21:36,928 --> 01:21:38,930
No, they aren't
the last--

1406
01:21:38,930 --> 01:21:41,933
there's one in
the red jersey
to come yet.

1407
01:21:41,933 --> 01:21:44,435
I've got a pain
in my front

1408
01:21:44,435 --> 01:21:46,437
from being so hungry.

1409
01:21:47,939 --> 01:21:49,440
Come on!

1410
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:50,942
The one in the red jersey

1411
01:21:50,942 --> 01:21:52,944
must have been mixed in
with the others.

1412
01:21:52,944 --> 01:21:55,947
No, I don't think so.

1413
01:21:55,947 --> 01:21:57,448
Let's go down.

1414
01:22:06,958 --> 01:22:10,461
I'll die if
I don't have
a sandwich.

1415
01:22:10,461 --> 01:22:13,464
Oh, give her
a silly sandwich!

1416
01:22:16,467 --> 01:22:19,971
I think the boy
in the red jersey's
had an accident.

1417
01:22:19,971 --> 01:22:21,472
As we speak,
he's probably lying

1418
01:22:21,472 --> 01:22:22,974
with his head
on the metal

1419
01:22:22,974 --> 01:22:24,475
unresisting prey
to any...

1420
01:22:24,475 --> 01:22:25,977
Oh, stop talking
like a book.

1421
01:22:25,977 --> 01:22:27,478
Come on, Phil,
keep close behind me.

1422
01:22:27,478 --> 01:22:28,479
If a train comes

1423
01:22:28,479 --> 01:22:30,481
stand flat against
the tunnel wall

1424
01:22:30,481 --> 01:22:31,983
and hold your
petticoats to you.

1425
01:22:31,983 --> 01:22:34,485
I will if you give me
a sandwich!

1426
01:22:35,486 --> 01:22:36,487
I'm going first.

1427
01:22:36,487 --> 01:22:37,989
It was my idea.

1428
01:22:53,504 --> 01:22:54,505
(grunts)

1429
01:22:54,505 --> 01:22:56,007
I don't like it.

1430
01:22:56,007 --> 01:22:57,508
I want
to go back.

1431
01:22:57,508 --> 01:22:58,509
(chugging approaching)

1432
01:22:59,010 --> 01:22:59,510
A train.

1433
01:23:00,011 --> 01:23:01,012
PETER:
Stand back!

1434
01:23:03,514 --> 01:23:05,016
Quick, in here!

1435
01:23:11,022 --> 01:23:17,528
(roaring and rumbling)

1436
01:23:27,538 --> 01:23:30,041
Oh, if the boy
in the red jersey

1437
01:23:30,041 --> 01:23:32,043
was in the way
of the train...

1438
01:23:43,554 --> 01:23:44,555
PETER:
Look!

1439
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:50,561
He's got blood.

1440
01:23:50,561 --> 01:23:52,063
Has he been killed?

1441
01:23:52,063 --> 01:23:55,566
No... he's fainted.

1442
01:23:55,566 --> 01:23:57,568
What should we do?

1443
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,569
Can we move him?

1444
01:23:58,569 --> 01:24:00,371
I don't think so.

1445
01:24:00,371 --> 01:24:01,439
He's big.

1446
01:24:03,441 --> 01:24:04,442
Hello?

1447
01:24:04,442 --> 01:24:06,444
Come on, wake up,
speak to us.

1448
01:24:06,444 --> 01:24:07,445
Wake up.

1449
01:24:07,445 --> 01:24:09,447
Well, I think
he's dead.

1450
01:24:10,948 --> 01:24:11,949
Stop that.

1451
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:14,452
I knew he wasn't.

1452
01:24:15,953 --> 01:24:16,954
I'm all right.

1453
01:24:16,954 --> 01:24:18,956
(moans)

1454
01:24:21,959 --> 01:24:23,461
I believe
I've broken my leg.

1455
01:24:23,461 --> 01:24:25,463
I tripped on one
of those silly wires.

1456
01:24:25,963 --> 01:24:27,465
(breathing hard)

1457
01:24:27,465 --> 01:24:28,466
Who are you?

1458
01:24:28,466 --> 01:24:30,468
Your rescue party.

1459
01:24:30,468 --> 01:24:31,969
Do you think you

1460
01:24:31,969 --> 01:24:33,971
could move
if we helped you?

1461
01:24:33,971 --> 01:24:34,972
I could try.

1462
01:24:34,972 --> 01:24:35,973
Come on.

1463
01:24:36,974 --> 01:24:38,976
Up, up you come.

1464
01:24:41,479 --> 01:24:42,480
(cries in agony)

1465
01:24:44,482 --> 01:24:45,983
Look, I'll stay with him.

1466
01:24:45,983 --> 01:24:47,485
You go and get help.

1467
01:24:47,485 --> 01:24:48,486
Go on!

1468
01:24:48,486 --> 01:24:49,987
Quickly!

1469
01:24:56,494 --> 01:24:58,496
(footsteps fading away)

1470
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:01,499
(water dripping)

1471
01:25:14,011 --> 01:25:15,513
Hello again.

1472
01:25:15,513 --> 01:25:17,515
What's your name?

1473
01:25:17,515 --> 01:25:20,017
Jim.

1474
01:25:20,017 --> 01:25:21,519
Mine's Bobbie.

1475
01:25:23,521 --> 01:25:25,022
Weren't there more
of you just now?

1476
01:25:25,523 --> 01:25:27,525
Yes, Peter and Phil,
my brother and sister.

1477
01:25:27,525 --> 01:25:29,527
They've gone to get
someone to carry you out.

1478
01:25:29,527 --> 01:25:32,530
F-funny names...

1479
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:34,031
All boys.

1480
01:25:34,031 --> 01:25:35,533
(chuckles)

1481
01:25:35,533 --> 01:25:37,034
Mine's Roberta really.

1482
01:25:37,034 --> 01:25:39,036
I wish I was a boy.

1483
01:25:39,036 --> 01:25:41,539
I think you're
all right as you are.

1484
01:25:55,553 --> 01:25:57,555
PHYLLIS:
I'm never going
in a tunnel again

1485
01:25:57,555 --> 01:25:59,056
as long as I live

1486
01:25:59,056 --> 01:26:01,559
even if there are
600 boys all inside

1487
01:26:01,559 --> 01:26:03,060
with all
their legs broken.

1488
01:26:03,561 --> 01:26:06,564
There's never a grown-up around
when you need one.

1489
01:26:06,564 --> 01:26:07,565
Hello?

1490
01:26:07,565 --> 01:26:08,566
Help!

1491
01:26:08,566 --> 01:26:10,067
(clattering)

1492
01:26:13,571 --> 01:26:15,072
Oh... hello.

1493
01:26:15,072 --> 01:26:17,575
Oh...

1494
01:26:17,575 --> 01:26:19,076
it's you.

1495
01:26:21,078 --> 01:26:23,080
(spits out seed)

1496
01:26:24,582 --> 01:26:27,585
So... sister still
mending that old dress

1497
01:26:27,585 --> 01:26:29,587
over and over-- ha!

1498
01:26:30,087 --> 01:26:31,589
Look...

1499
01:26:54,612 --> 01:26:56,113
Where do you live?

1500
01:26:56,113 --> 01:26:58,115
I go to boarding school
in Maidbridge.

1501
01:26:58,115 --> 01:27:00,618
I suppose I've
got to get back
there somehow.

1502
01:27:00,618 --> 01:27:03,120
Well, you could bring
him to our house.

1503
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,622
I'll go ahead
and tell Mother.

1504
01:27:04,622 --> 01:27:06,123
Hey, what
will your ma say

1505
01:27:06,123 --> 01:27:08,125
about your bringing home
a sick stranger?

1506
01:27:08,125 --> 01:27:11,128
Doctor:
That'll be fine.

1507
01:27:11,128 --> 01:27:14,632
They've done it before--
with a Russian.

1508
01:27:18,135 --> 01:27:19,136
Right.

1509
01:27:37,655 --> 01:27:39,657
(quietly):
Night-night, Peter.

1510
01:27:39,657 --> 01:27:42,660
(whispering):
Mother, as Jim's parents
live in Northumberland

1511
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:44,161
couldn't we
keep him here

1512
01:27:44,161 --> 01:27:45,663
and not say anything
to his parents

1513
01:27:45,663 --> 01:27:47,164
until he's better?

1514
01:27:47,164 --> 01:27:49,166
It would be such
a surprise for them.

1515
01:27:49,166 --> 01:27:52,169
Yes, it would.

1516
01:27:52,169 --> 01:27:55,673
Now Father's away

1517
01:27:55,673 --> 01:27:58,676
there's no other man in
the house apart from me.

1518
01:27:58,676 --> 01:28:01,679
That's why I want Jim
to stay so much.

1519
01:28:03,681 --> 01:28:05,683
Do you miss your father
very much?

1520
01:28:05,683 --> 01:28:07,685
Yes, of course I do.

1521
01:28:11,188 --> 01:28:13,190
Couldn't you nurse Jim?

1522
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:14,692
I can't
do that and write.

1523
01:28:14,692 --> 01:28:17,695
I've telegraphed
his school, and his parents.

1524
01:28:17,695 --> 01:28:19,196
Don't worry

1525
01:28:19,196 --> 01:28:21,699
he'll stay with us
till he's a lot better.

1526
01:28:41,218 --> 01:28:45,222
(pump squeaking,
water splashing)

1527
01:29:19,256 --> 01:29:21,258
Oh, hello, my dear.

1528
01:29:21,258 --> 01:29:23,260
Hello.

1529
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:24,762
I got your letter.

1530
01:29:24,762 --> 01:29:27,264
Uh, but it wasn't needed.

1531
01:29:27,264 --> 01:29:29,767
I had my doubts
about your father's case

1532
01:29:29,767 --> 01:29:32,770
when I first read about it
in the papers at the time.

1533
01:29:32,770 --> 01:29:36,774
And ever since
I've known who you were

1534
01:29:36,774 --> 01:29:40,778
I've been trying
to find out things.

1535
01:29:40,778 --> 01:29:45,282
All I can tell you
is I have hopes, my dear.

1536
01:29:45,282 --> 01:29:46,283
I have hopes.

1537
01:29:46,283 --> 01:29:48,786
But I think
we should hang on to

1538
01:29:48,786 --> 01:29:50,287
our secret
a little longer.

1539
01:29:50,287 --> 01:29:52,790
It wouldn't do
to upset your mother

1540
01:29:52,790 --> 01:29:55,292
about a false hope,
would it?

1541
01:29:55,292 --> 01:29:57,795
You don't think
Father did it, do you?

1542
01:29:57,795 --> 01:29:59,296
Say you don't.

1543
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:03,801
I'm perfectly certain he didn't.

1544
01:30:09,306 --> 01:30:10,808
PETER:
Wow!

1545
01:30:11,308 --> 01:30:13,310
PHYLLIS:
Ready?

1546
01:30:17,314 --> 01:30:18,315
Brilliant!

1547
01:30:18,315 --> 01:30:19,817
(Phyllis squeals)

1548
01:30:31,328 --> 01:30:35,332
(whispering to herself)

1549
01:31:07,631 --> 01:31:11,135
I'll, uh, be off then.

1550
01:31:11,135 --> 01:31:13,137
Yes.

1551
01:31:14,638 --> 01:31:16,640
Excuse me.

1552
01:31:20,644 --> 01:31:23,647
Have... have you packed
your, um, things?

1553
01:31:23,647 --> 01:31:25,649
My things?

1554
01:31:25,649 --> 01:31:27,651
Yes... they're...

1555
01:31:27,651 --> 01:31:30,154
they're all packed.

1556
01:31:30,154 --> 01:31:32,656
If you leave anything, we...
we could probably...

1557
01:31:32,656 --> 01:31:35,159
Send it on in a parcel?

1558
01:31:35,159 --> 01:31:36,160
Yes.

1559
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:40,164
So, um...

1560
01:31:43,167 --> 01:31:47,171
Good-bye.

1561
01:31:47,171 --> 01:31:49,173
Good-bye.

1562
01:31:52,176 --> 01:31:53,677
That's my address.

1563
01:31:54,178 --> 01:31:54,678
Lovely.

1564
01:31:55,179 --> 01:31:56,180
Let's write.

1565
01:31:56,180 --> 01:31:57,681
Yes, let's.

1566
01:32:47,731 --> 01:32:49,233
(meows)

1567
01:33:10,754 --> 01:33:16,260
I wonder if the
railway misses us?

1568
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:18,762
We never go
to see it now.

1569
01:33:18,762 --> 01:33:21,265
We've had Jim
to play with.

1570
01:33:21,265 --> 01:33:25,269
What I don't like is our
not waving at the 9:15

1571
01:33:25,269 --> 01:33:27,771
and sending our love
to Father by it.

1572
01:33:27,771 --> 01:33:30,274
All right,
let's start doing it again.

1573
01:33:39,283 --> 01:33:41,785
Hurry up!

1574
01:33:41,785 --> 01:33:43,287
When you get married

1575
01:33:43,287 --> 01:33:45,289
your bootlace will come undone
going up the aisle

1576
01:33:45,289 --> 01:33:47,791
and the groom will fall over it
and smash his nose

1577
01:33:47,791 --> 01:33:50,294
and won't marry you and
you'll have to be an old maid.

1578
01:33:59,303 --> 01:34:03,807
(passengers cheer)

1579
01:34:21,325 --> 01:34:23,827
What on earth
does that mean?

1580
01:34:23,827 --> 01:34:25,329
I don't know.

1581
01:34:25,329 --> 01:34:29,333
PHYLLIS:
Let's go and
tell Mother.

1582
01:34:39,343 --> 01:34:40,844
Mother...

1583
01:34:40,844 --> 01:34:42,346
PETER:
Guess what happened?

1584
01:34:42,346 --> 01:34:45,349
Hundreds and hundreds
of people waved to...

1585
01:34:45,349 --> 01:34:46,350
No, about 50.

1586
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:47,351
About 50 then.

1587
01:34:47,351 --> 01:34:50,854
And it started off
from the old gentleman and...

1588
01:34:50,854 --> 01:34:51,855
No, it didn't--

1589
01:34:51,855 --> 01:34:53,857
It started off
from the driver.

1590
01:34:53,857 --> 01:34:54,858
No, it didn't.

1591
01:34:54,858 --> 01:34:56,360
Yes, it did.

1592
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:59,863
Okay, it started
from the driver and it
spread like wildfire.

1593
01:35:04,368 --> 01:35:07,371
Don't you feel well,
my sweetheart?

1594
01:35:07,371 --> 01:35:08,872
I don't know.

1595
01:35:08,872 --> 01:35:12,876
Mother, would you mind if I
walked down to the station?

1596
01:35:13,377 --> 01:35:17,381
Well... no, of course not.

1597
01:35:45,909 --> 01:35:47,411
Morning, miss.

1598
01:35:47,411 --> 01:35:49,913
Good morning.

1599
01:35:49,913 --> 01:35:53,917
Good morning to you, miss,
and many of them.

1600
01:35:54,418 --> 01:35:58,422
God bless you, dear.

1601
01:36:06,930 --> 01:36:09,433
The 11:57 is right
on time, miss.

1602
01:36:12,936 --> 01:36:14,438
Here you are.

1603
01:36:14,438 --> 01:36:17,941
You know, I don't think
I've ever been so glad
of anything.

1604
01:36:18,442 --> 01:36:22,446
One thing I must do,
on a day like today,
no offense...

1605
01:36:24,948 --> 01:36:26,450
You're not offended,
are you?

1606
01:36:26,450 --> 01:36:28,952
I haven't taken
too great a liberty?

1607
01:36:28,952 --> 01:36:31,955
No, no, of course not,
dear Mr. Perks.

1608
01:36:31,955 --> 01:36:33,957
But on a day like what?

1609
01:36:35,959 --> 01:36:40,464
(train chugging closer)

1610
01:37:46,029 --> 01:37:49,533
Oh, my daddy... my daddy!

1611
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:15,993
And they caught him,
yes, they did.

1612
01:38:15,993 --> 01:38:20,998
And everyone now knows
that it wasn't your daddy.

1613
01:38:20,998 --> 01:38:23,000
I always knew.

1614
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,002
I thought you did.

1615
01:38:28,005 --> 01:38:33,510
Why don't you go in
and tell Mother, quietly

1616
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:37,014
that everything's all right.

1617
01:38:48,025 --> 01:38:53,530
(wind rushing through trees)

1618
01:39:56,593 --> 01:39:58,595
The notion of
a softhearted railroad baron

1619
01:39:58,595 --> 01:40:02,599
will seem farfetched to people
who know railroad history.

1620
01:40:02,599 --> 01:40:06,103
In America, at least,
most railroad tycoons

1621
01:40:06,103 --> 01:40:10,607
from Commodore Vanderbilt on,
were ruthless and piratical

1622
01:40:10,607 --> 01:40:12,609
and some, clearly criminal.

1623
01:40:12,609 --> 01:40:15,612
Railroading
was a brutal business at the top

1624
01:40:15,612 --> 01:40:16,613
and at the bottom

1625
01:40:16,613 --> 01:40:20,617
where the owner's indifference
to safety problems

1626
01:40:20,617 --> 01:40:24,621
produced an appalling toll
of mutilations and deaths.

1627
01:40:24,621 --> 01:40:26,623
It engendered class hatreds

1628
01:40:26,623 --> 01:40:30,127
which expanded the socialist
movement in America

1629
01:40:30,127 --> 01:40:33,630
and made a working-class hero
of Eugene Debs--

1630
01:40:33,630 --> 01:40:35,132
onetime railroad worker

1631
01:40:35,632 --> 01:40:39,136
twice the socialist
candidate for president.

1632
01:40:39,136 --> 01:40:42,139
Edith Nesbit never
worked on the railroad

1633
01:40:42,139 --> 01:40:45,142
but like Debs,
she was also a socialist.

1634
01:40:45,142 --> 01:40:48,645
She was a founding member
of the Fabian Society--

1635
01:40:48,645 --> 01:40:53,150
a group of intellectuals whose
ideas influenced the development

1636
01:40:53,150 --> 01:40:57,154
of British socialism and
the birth of the labor party.

1637
01:40:57,154 --> 01:41:00,157
It's interesting to note
that tonight's show

1638
01:41:00,157 --> 01:41:03,660
with its conventional
children's-story morality

1639
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:08,165
was written by a woman whose
private life was as unorthodox

1640
01:41:08,165 --> 01:41:09,166
as her politics.

1641
01:41:09,166 --> 01:41:11,168
She and her husband,
Hubert Bland

1642
01:41:11,168 --> 01:41:14,671
were married two months after
the birth of their first child.

1643
01:41:15,172 --> 01:41:18,675
They had a second child--
Edith named him Fabian.

1644
01:41:18,675 --> 01:41:24,181
Then the Fabian Society's female
secretary came to live with them

1645
01:41:24,181 --> 01:41:28,185
and within the year,
gave birth to Hubert's baby.

1646
01:41:28,185 --> 01:41:31,188
Edith raised the child
as her own.

1647
01:41:31,188 --> 01:41:34,691
She and Hubert remained married
for 34 years.

1648
01:41:34,691 --> 01:41:37,694
When he died,
Edith married again

1649
01:41:37,694 --> 01:41:40,697
and continued writing
children's books

1650
01:41:41,198 --> 01:41:43,700
until her death,
ten years later.

1651
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:47,704
All together,
she published over 40 novels.

1652
01:41:47,704 --> 01:41:49,206
I'm Russell Baker.

1653
01:41:49,706 --> 01:41:50,707
Good night.

1654
