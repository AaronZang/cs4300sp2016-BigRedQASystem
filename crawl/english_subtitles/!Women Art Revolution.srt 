[Woman Narrating]
In the late 1960s,
a few women artists formed a coalition...

8
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,947
and named it WAR-
Women Artists in Revolution.

[Narrator]
Andyou have to askyourself...

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,563
why it was necessary for them
to do this in the first place.

14
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:15,007
The books that you read
in those days...

15
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,806
were written in a way
that denigrated
women artists,

16
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:20,743
if they even
mentioned them.

17
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,113
As an undergraduate
at Harvard University,

18
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,484
I don't think there was
a single woman artist...

19
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:31,991
whose workwas ever discussed
in any one of my classes.

¢Ü Yourtime is gonna come ¢Ü¢Ü

21
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:38,790
When you're a woman, it's hard
to tell thatyou're being censored...

22
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,356
when you're not in a museum
to begin with.

23
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,369
[Narrator]
Canyou name three women artists?

24
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,166
[Interviewer]
Who's a woman artist?

25
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,901
Um, Frida Kahlo.

26
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,966
That's one.
Yeah?

27
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,739
Uh, Frida.

28
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,236
Oh.

29
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,811
[Narrator]
Can anyone name three women artists?

30
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:06,188
- I need two more women artists.
- Two more women artists.

31
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,090
Yes. A female.

32
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,659
[Narrator]
This film is peppered with images...

33
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,929
that foryears
you were prevented from seeing...

34
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,904
because there was no access to them.

35
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,375
This film is the remains
ofan insistent history...

36
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,780
that refuses to wait any longer
to be told.

1968.

42
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,198
One year after the summer oflove,

43
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,134
America was still in Vietnam.

44
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:55,573
While at home, the Black Panthers,
civil rights and free speech movements...

45
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:59,305
were onlypart
ofthe subterranean agitations.

46

[Joan Baez]
¢Ü We shall overcome someday ¢Ü¢Ü

47
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,713
Another revolution was in progress.

48
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:11,857
There was a moral fervor
to gather the fractured,

49
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:17,363
displaced and scattered remnants
ofthe conditions of obscurity.

50
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,967
I was a freshly radicalized
graduate student at Berkeley...

51
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,970
during the free speech movement.

52
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,872
I came from Cleveland
and was expected to return,

53
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:32,207
but, after Berkeley,
there was no turning back.

54
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,976
I felt an urgency to capture that moment,

55
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,313
to hold on to that experience.

56
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,285
I wasn't about to trust
my own memory,

57
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,879
which was fragile even then.

58
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:49,088
So with a borrowed camera, I shot people
that came through my living room...

59
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:53,394
ri ght here on this very sofa
3 5 years ago.

60
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,504
One ofthe earliest
feminist demonstrations...

61
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:03,269
was staged at the 1968
Miss America contest,

62
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,141
which was a symbol for women
who measured up...

63
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:09,204
or didn't measure up
to artificial standards.

64
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,545
[Male Announcer]
The new Miss America stands 5 feet 7,

65
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,487
weighs 125 pounds...

66
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,822
and measures 36-24 1/2-36.

67
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,925
Police arrested a young woman
inside the A tlantic City Convention Hall.

68
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,796
Police said the woman was spraying
a foul-smelling vapor...

69
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,801
about 20yards
from the end ofthe runway.

70
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:33,270
[Woman]
¢Ü We're gonna ask all our sisters here ¢Ü

71
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,500
¢Ü To come andjoin the fight ¢Ü

72
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:40,069
¢Ü Don't need no Miss America
no more ¢Ü¢Ü

73
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,208
[Leeson Narrating]
And it was at that
precarious moment in history...

74
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,844
[Siren Wailing]
that art and politics fused...

75
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,887
and then transfused...

76
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,288
into the blocked
cultural arteries ofthe time.

77
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:58,788
I t was a weeklong protest of art events
against the Vietnam War.

78
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:02,801
I used a formation from my war piece.

79
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:07,272
And we snaked through the streets
of SoHo with black armbands.

80
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:15,710
[Ron Dellums]
The politics of 1970 must clearly
sayto allAmerican people...

81
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:19,843
that the walls between the races
and the walls between the classes...

82
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,614
must come crashing down.

83
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,519
[Leeson Narrating]
Judy Cohen-Garrowitz
was inspired by the Black Panthers...

84
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:29,049
when she changed her last name
to Chicago.

85
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,859
[Chicago]
So we adapted the forms of the Black Panthers
before we developed our own forms.

86
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,593
No, it was absolutely true.

87
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:39,070
I didn't feel like I had a name, you know,
and I wanted to make some statement,

88
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:43,700
some kind of symbolic statement
about the fact that I was taking control
of my own destiny.

89
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:49,279
I was fighting it out,
pretty much alone and isolated.

90
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,850
[Leeson Narrating]
I shot whereverand wheneverl could.

91
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:57,083
This clip ofJudy Chicago was shot
in a bathroom at Hayward State,

92
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,954
where we were able
to get good sound.

93
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,426
Uh, let's see if I can think back
that far, Lynn.

94
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,488
Now, we're going back
into the end of the '60s, okay?

95
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:11,503
There were almost no women artists
who were visible at all.

96
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,165
[Lesson Narrating]
We all thought we were alone.

97
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,232
Some friends said to me,

98
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,746
"If anybody can tell you,
you know,

99
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:24,112
what galleries you can go to
orwhat you can do with this stuff,

100
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,117
go to Leo Castelli."

101
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:30,417
So like a fool,
I made an appointment.
[Laughing]

102
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,823
And I went to the uptown gallery,
but of course he didn't see me.

103
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,691
Ivan Karp saw me.

104
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:40,255
And I was wearing
high-heeled boots at the time,

105
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,097
and so I was, you know,
really kinda tall.

106
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:46,900
And Ivan is small.

107
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:52,570
And there were these sculpture stands
all around the place,

108
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:56,411
and he didn't have me
put my big tablet-

109
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,450
24-by-36- on this.

110
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,247
He had me put it on the floor.

111
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,482
So every time I turned a page,

112
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:06,992
it was like I was genuflecting
to this guy, you know?

113
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,720
I felt humiliated.

114
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,558
And then he said- he said,

115
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,428
"What'd you bring these
to me for?"

116
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:17,026
I learned to, you know,

117
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,971
Iook into a lot offacets
ofthe real world...

118
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,100
and what it meant
to be a woman artist...

119
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:27,305
in the society
and in the art world.

120
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,407
And as it was- it was pretty tough.

121
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,650
Women aspiring to success
in the male-dominated art world,
as we know,

122
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,953
must work much harder at it...

123
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:46,022
and will be defined as second-rate
for the most part.

124
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,829
It was sort of a built-in attitude
within the institutions...

125
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:53,303
that it was acceptable,
normal and preferable...

126
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,840
to have all-white-male shows.

127
00:07:55,908 --> 00:08:00,368
So, coming up against that,
both as a black person and as a woman,

128
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,904
was very daunting because
it had to do with basic attitudes.

129
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:11,216
[Leeson Narrating]
The people I was meeting
didn't realize that I was recording...

130
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,418
and that theywere creating
much ofwhat would become...

131
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,985
part ofthe feminist art movement.

132
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:22,901
But we all felt something
transformative was occurring...

133
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,960
and that we were a part of it.

134
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:29,207
One voice, and then another,

135
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,266
became a chorus,

136
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,869
syncopated into a movement,

137
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,909
became a revolution.

138
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:50,089
These works are relics ofresistance...

139
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,227
and very different from the work...

140
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,293
that was being exhibited
in museums and galleries...

141
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:03,898
or was taught about
in art schools and universities.

142
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,606
[Camera Whirring]

143
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:16,845
[Man]
Mi ni mal ism was the prevailing
tendency at that time.

144
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,357
The whole ethos of minimalist art...

145
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:26,194
was to arrive at an ever-purer notion
ofwhat an object could be.

146
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:30,361
[Baca]
I stepped forth from the university
trying to figure out how,

147
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,461
trained as a minimalist painter,

148
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:37,100
I was going to make mywork relevant
to people I loved and cared about.

149
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:40,304
And there was that incredible
disjunction at that point...

150
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,440
between content
and the notion of making art.

151
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:48,647
In otherwords, art was content-less.
It was free and devoid of politics.

152
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,450
And that was a higher form.

153

When you have a culture
in a state of grave agitation,

154
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:04,503
where people are marching
by the hundreds ofthousands
in the streets-

Come alive, brothers!
We are waiting foryou!

And the leading artistic activity
ofthe day is mute...

00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:18,807
because ofthe way
that that art is construed
as an intellectual pursuit.

The growing tensions between
minimal and feminist art...

159
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,317
are expressed in this performance...

160
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,259
where one artist
represents minimal art...

161
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,421
and the other feminist art...

162
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,727
as they wrestle for domination...

163
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,791

that American culture
was already breaking through.

169

There had to be an invention
ofa new kind ofart,

00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,959
and that's exactlywhen feminism

What really spurred me
to do performances...

181
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:46,331
was around 1970 when the killings
at Kent State happened...

182
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,896
and Nixon invaded Cambodia.

183
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:53,638
I got a sense ofthe immediacy
ofthese issues in my life...

184
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,649
that made me feel as though
the work I had done up to that point...

185
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:02,051
was just not adequate
to express my current concerns.

186
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:05,022
And so I felt the need
to move out into the world...

187
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:09,960
and also the need to be more
concrete and confrontational...

188
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,827
in my interactions with people
through mywork.

the artist Robert Morris
closed his exhibition at the Whitney.

192
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:25,568
Robert Rauschenberg and Carl Andre
withdrew their work
from the Venice Biennale,

193
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,378
and together they opened
a Biennale-in-Exile in New York City.

194
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:34,579
But the artists in this exhibition
were only white men.

195
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:37,349
They said,
"This show can't include women!"

196
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:43,089
Well, we just got mad, and we said,

and threatened to demonstrate
ifthey didn't integrate the exhibition.

199
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,262
[Ringgold]
And that was the first action.

200
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,901

Those were the days
when two people
could raise a lot ofhell.

other creative actions for integration
surfaced throughout the country.

We had al ready picketed
the Corcoran Gallery's Biennial...

for having an all-male exhibition...

210
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:41,581
right at the time when people were
beginning to have a discussion about this.

211
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,021
And we organized that at my house,

212
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,116
and the conference used
one of my bedrooms...

213
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,254
as our headquarters.

It was a sculpture annual,
and people said,

216
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,195
"There are no women who make sculpture"-
the usual silly business.

217
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,606
We did a big demonstration
around theWhitney Annual.

218
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,007
We picketed everySaturday.

219
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:10,077
We had women's slides projected
on the outside ofthe Whitney
at the opening.

220
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,181
We faked a press release...

221
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:17,416
that went out to all the media
on Whitney stationery...

222
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,925
saying that the Whitneywas so pleased
to be the first museum...

223
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,291
to acknowledge that women artists
have been neglected...

224
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,762
and have 50%women
and 50% nonwhites.

Those slides were projected
on the outside ofthe museum.

226
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:34,333
Artists placed eggs
inside the exhibition space.

227
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,874
Faith painted her eggs black...

228
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:39,604
and wrote "50%" on them.

You realize that little changes
make big changes.

231
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:51,081
I eventually wrote the song-
"Stand up forwhat you want to do.

232
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:54,421
Stand up, there's no one
telling you how to stand up.

Stand up when people
putyou down.

above the ground.

lives of certainty.

was the cover ofthe catalog,

243
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,192
with a grid
with 50 heads of men on it.

244
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,854
We went to the museum...

245
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,366
and counted the works on the walls.

246
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,561

and they felt they had to negotiate.

It was very hard to find a show
ofwomen's work in SoHo.

We rented a ground-floor loft
on Wooster Street.

I think it was 97 Wooster Street.

252
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:01,992
And we gutted the inside, and we built
with our own hands the gallery.

254
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,864

How many people
have read all three books?

257
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,373
We didn't study men at all,
figuring that everybody
had studied men plenty.

258
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:24,610
So we were all into remedial education-
learning our own history, our own heritage.

How to meet a gallery,
how to presentyourself
to the world, you know.

All ofthese things
that men artists do.

261
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,890
We found pictures.
We photographed them.
We made slide libraries.

262
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,986
We would meet everyweek
and we would choose a subject,

263
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:41,191
and then what we tried to do
was make art out ofit.

[Chicago]
I remember asking my students...

265
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:47,497
how many ofthem had been raped,

266
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,440
and being just totally shocked
when, like,

267
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,841
a quarter or half ofthem
raised their hands.

268
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:57,847
It was all discovery about
what our true experiences had been.

269
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,976
I was really scared. You know,
I had no idea what I was getting myselfinto,

270
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,714
but I was impelled to do it.

271
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,983
There was, as we went along,

272
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,185
a lot ofhostility
and kind ofjealousy, I think,

273
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,421
that began to develop
about that program.

274
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,556
We were sitting on the platform
talking about these ideas,

275
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:18,899
and this man came up from the audience
and started threatening me.

276
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,304
[Lacy]
Some man jumped up onstage
and slugged her.

277
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,606
I discovered that it was easier to get access
to the subject matter through performance.

278
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,612
Most women knew how to act out.

any experience performing,

from our own point ofview
as women in thatyear.

286
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,606
And then we went to CalArts.

287
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:03,975
My husband Paul Brock
was the dean ofCalArts.

288
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:09,218
He proposed thatJudy
be made a member ofhis faculty.

289
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,949
I was already a member.

290
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:16,655
Mimi Schapiro and Judy Chicago
had organized this big conference.

291
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,219
It was a weekend at CalArts.

292
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:24,065
And during that conference,
they invited women from all over the country...

293
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,627
to come and show slides
and talk about theirwork.

294
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,572
And that's all we did for three days.
It was very simple.

295
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:33,202
Lynn, what we found out was...

296
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:37,715
that our slides were moved out
all over the country.

297
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,275
Theywere copied!
It was like an underground railroad.

298
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:49,086
The women in America
were just waiting to be released.

299
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:54,159
When I saw those slides,

300
00:18:54,233 --> 00:19:00,468
after decades ofhaving felt
that to be an artist is to be a man,

301
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,139
it was like a veil had lifted.

302
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:12,181
Women were able
to enter the art structure...

303
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,412
through performance.

304
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:18,479
Performance art
is this strange, amorphous area...

305
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:21,958
that attracts hybrids
from every discipline.

306
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,353
It remains this peculiar place...

307
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,762
that people can be
extremely experimental.

308
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:45,005
[Schapiro]
We started the whole
consciousness-raising concept...

309
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:48,644
on the idea ofthe grape theory.

310
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,781
One person tells another person,
another person tells a third person,

311
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,954
and pretty soon you've got a group,
and you can start talking to each other.

312
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,894
And there's a wholeness about that.

313
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,456
I remember being in
this consciousness-raising group
and looking around the room.

314
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,525
Theywere all white women.

315
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,204
And I was reallyfascinated by
the fact that all ofthesewomen...

316
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:12,675
had made the determinations
that I was in the process of making-

317
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,914
choosing to focus on theirwork,

318
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:20,782
choosing perhaps not to be wives
in the traditional sense.

319
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:26,586
By facing up to the way
the micro-politics of power
within the family...

320
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:29,354
have shaped women
and their responses.

321
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:34,798
I think I was very scared by the anger
all ofthem were expressing, and the rage.

322
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:39,462
I was very recently married,
and I was feeling very conflictual...

323
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,063
about how one had to suddenly
be angry about men.

324
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,973
Naturally, as a result,
I had to leave my husband,

325
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:49,502
as so many of us did.

326
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,778
Everyone's opinion
counted equally.

327
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,877
That was both wonderful
and a total nightmare.

328
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,286
And sometimes
it just simply ground to a halt.

329
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,325
But when it didn't
grind to a halt,

330
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,883
then you could sometimes
get a kind of combustion,

331
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,361
a kind ofnitroglycerin effect...

332
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:09,457
that shot offall kinds of new directions
and ideas in really productive ways.

333
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,833
What we found was a whole
different way to talk about work.

334
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:17,204
And I discovered very quickly,
it wasn't the way the boys talked about art,

335
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,767
that we talked about
things like content-

336
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:24,043
how much ofthe feminist movement, period,
was about giving us permission...

337
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,811
to let us be who we thinkwe are.

338
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,374
That simple.

339
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,944
I stopped doing the dishes,
making the three meals a day,

340
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,514
the laundry
and the housecleaning and so on.

341
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:37,961
The process of personal liberation for me
resulted in the breakup of my marriage.

342
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,899
So that was my first introduction
to feminism.

343
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,869
And there was a second stage ofthat
in which after-

344
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:49,532
right after- a few days
after I left my marriage, I was raped.

345
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,941
And that experience
was highly politicizing for me.

346
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:56,879
And I became
very strongly connected to the fact...

347
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,473
that I wanted all of my energy-

348
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:03,681
my professional energies,
my personal energies,
my political energies-

349
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:08,351
to be integrated in the struggle
forwomen's liberation.

"Gee, this is pretty squeaky clean."

378

And it struck me as a kind of
intellectualized version of minimalism.

From 1973 to 1979- nearly a decade-

00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,848
I lived as a fictional person.

Roberta had a driver's license,
saw a psychiatrist...

and had better credit than I did.

to eventually show a portrait
ofwhat it was like...

to experience alienation,
rejection and loneliness.

Roberta put ads in newspapers
to meet roommates,

405

and, as she met them,
she became part oftheir reality...

just as they became
part ofher fiction.

407
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:50,937
She was a fractured identity,
a virtual person...

She was a mirror of culture.

412
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:08,530
So we made art
in which we created identities,

even fictional histories,

that whites and blacks
should not use the same bathroom.

trying to look like a woman,

00:28:56,768 --> 00:29:01,034
photographs using makeup to beautify
and then to deform my face.

461
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:06,408
And then Judy said, "Well, what doyou
think ofthe work thatyou see here?"

462
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:12,049
And there were flowers and breasts
all over the walls,

463
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,813
and I thought it was hideous.

464
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:18,344
So I said,
"It looks prescriptive to me."

465
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,254
And then she said-

466
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:23,692
[Screaming]
"Don'tyou understand
what we're trying to do here?

00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:31,462
So, uh, I started crying.

469
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,766
I completely lost it and just, you know-

470
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:36,568
I couldn't believe that a feminist
could act like this.

471
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:41,772
And to this day, I haven't forgiven
Judy Chicago for making me cry.

472
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:47,648
In China, they have study groups.
They have consciousness-raising groups.

473
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:51,849
They read theory. They read Mao,
they read Marx, they read Lenin!

474
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,619
It's, like, you say,
"How do I make change?"
and we tell you,

475
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:58,025
and you say,
"Oh, I don't wanna do all that.
That won't make change!"

476
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:02,430
And we say toyou,
"Those of us who are effectively
making change are not ignorant.

477
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,992
Those people who have ever made change
in the history ofthe human race
were not ignorant,

478
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,664
and nobodywho is ignorant
will ever make change!"

479
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,506
Unfortunately,
because of some moves thatJudy made-

480
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,568
Iike locking the door ofthe program-

481
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:18,207
this exacerbated the hostility.

482
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:22,583
That is one ofthe reasons
women are not able to translate
their aspirations into reality-

483
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,556
because they are embedded
in remaining ignorant,

484
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,922
and it pisses me off.

[Leeson Narrating] Twenty-one students in
the FeministArt program at CalArts,

486

under the supervision ofJudy Chicago
and Miriam Schapiro,

487

488
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:47,234
which transformed
a vacant Hollywood home...

489
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,780
into a feminist artwork.

490
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,980
The fi rst year that I was teaching
with J udy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro,

491
00:30:57,055 --> 00:31:00,821
I found it to be difficult
because theywere not
speaking to each other.

492
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,862
Womanhouse had already happened.

493
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:09,127
That was kind ofthe finale
ofthe excitement.

494
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,226
Being able to actually address women's
educational needs within an institution...

495
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:15,170
that supposedlywas committed to that,
that was wonderful and thrilling.

496
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,901
But of course, it didn't work.

497
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:21,435
So we decided to leave
and had an idea to do a brochure...

498
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,912
in which we would be standing
inside oftrash cans...

499
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:26,314
throwing away old art history
and old art...

500
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,614
and pulling out
feminist art history and art,

501
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:33,714
and went to ourfriend Sheila de Bretteville
to see ifshewould assist us with the brochure.

502
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:36,783
And she thought thatwas
just theworst idea she'd ever heard.

At the core ofwhat

Lynn, I love thatyou see it as political!
I see it as very political.

505
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:50,196
The independence
ofhaving our own institution
is a really heady experience.

506

You don't have to ask permission
from anyone.

and just going ahead with it.

and they held the first classes
in Sheila's living room.

513

Eventually,
they founded their own building.

We found a building that had a tremendous
amount of dignity and presence,

'cause it was like warehouses.

"Oh, these are two gangs. They're gonna
see all these women and fight with us."

The Equal Rights Amendment was passed
in the House ofRepresentatives,

525
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:04,574
and there was a buoyancy
about new possibilities.

at different schools...

in Minneapolis and Chicago and Atlanta.

Itjust hurts to not have money
when you want things so badly.

539
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:56,029
I thinkwe used it wrong then.

540
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,761
We saw that as, you know,

541
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,167
"The dominant culture
not letting us have what we have"...

instead ofthe identification
with people who don't have.

543
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:06,008
I think there wasn't
enough identification with that,

544
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:09,137
and it made- it made it peculiar...

00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,774
It was a series of gestures
that went-

604
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:08,083
And that act of covering...

605
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:12,316
that part ofthe body,
touching oneselfthere,

606
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:15,223
as far as I knew,
no one had ever done that before.

607
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:20,296
In fact, a friend of mine,
a dancer,

608
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,764
said when she saw that,
she gasped.

609
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:25,996
Instead ofthe female body
being the enemy of an artist
or the muse for an artist,

610
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:30,268
suddenly it really became
not just the stuff ofwork,
but the tool ofwork.

611
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:35,100
[Schneemann]
The real struggle with mywork
was to potentially introduce...

612
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:38,546
or penetrate my culture
with different meanings
ofthe female body...

613
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:42,245
and the female attributes
ofthat body.

614
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,384
But it was the body
in conjunction...

615
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:48,823
and as an extension
of my materials as a painter.

616
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:51,953
So the body itself
was subjected to the materials...

617
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:55,362
that I, as a painter,
was using in the constructions.

618
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:59,028
It was painted, it was greased,
it was oiled, it was chalked.

619
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:02,038
It was covered in ropes,
it was collaged.

620
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:05,598
They all said it was
like a kind of pornography,

621
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,940
and ifl wanted to paint,
I should paint.

622
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,742
It was an imaginative leap...

623
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:14,649
to think thatwomen could
represent sexuality on the screen...

624
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,086
without somehow
being either condemned by it,

625
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:20,646
without it being career suicide,

626
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:24,525
without being laughed at
orwithout being attacked
by otherwomen,

627
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,620
because that wasn't any nicer.

628
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,964
[Leeson Narrating]
Media was challenged.

629
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,910

Media became a platform
forarticulating private battlefields.

652
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:04,785
Myvideo diaries were a way
to, finally, hear myself.

653
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:06,853
There were things
that happened that...

you weren't supposed to talk about.

655
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:16,706
When I was small, there would be
these episodes ofbatterings.

656
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,233
And I would go up to my attic...

and retreat into other people
that had a voice,

since I had lost my own.

You're not supposed to talk about it.

[Leeson Narrating]
Myart was a zone ofsafetyandsurvival.

661
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:41,153
Part ofthe reason that the feminist
art movement could happen...

662
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,257
was that there were feminists
writing about art.

663
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:46,699
[Leeson Narrating]
I created three fictional critics.

664
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:50,501
Theirnames were Herbert Goode,
PrudenceJuris and Gay Abandon.

665
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:54,066
And these fictional critics
wrote about my work.

666
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:57,409
The articles got published
in prestigious journals,

667
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:59,711
and I took the published articles
into galleries.

668
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:02,081
And that's how I got my first exhibition.

669
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:04,879
There were women starting magazines.

670
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:09,123
[Leeson Narrating]
Magazines were self-published-

671
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,959
Chrysalis on the West Coast,
Heresies on the East Coast...

672
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,931
and many others throughout the country.

673
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:25,072
[Kozloff]
The first meeting of the group that was
to become Heresies was actually in this loft.

674
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:28,475
We literally took it out
to the bookstores ourselves.

675
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,537
We did distribution.
We did mailing.

676
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:42,919
[Hammond]
Issue Number 3
was "Lesbian Art and Artists."

677
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:48,021
In editing that issue, one ofthe things
that came up right away...

678
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:51,033
was how little therewas out there.

679
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:59,571
Itwas very hard getting women to,
in a way, you know-

680
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:01,702
in a sense, almost come out as artists.

681
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:05,840
Not come out as lesbians,
but to come out as artists.

682
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:11,081
Because the lesbian separatist community
was anti-art. It was bourgeois.

[Camera ShutterClicks]

684
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,886
My sense
ofthe feminist movement then...

685
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:20,556
was that women were kind of
storming the art world.

686
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:24,158
We were trying it all out.
We were giving birth to it.

Pardon?
Inventing it.

688
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,901
It was excitement.
It was empowering.

689
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,964
Itwas a lot offucking work.

690
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:35,808
Itwas such an explosive time, where
all ofthis was really getting sorted out.

691
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:39,781
There wasn't an ideologyyet.
There wasn't a prescriptive way
of doing things.

692
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:44,753
And halfthe intoxication was that
we were there helping to figure it out.

693
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:49,418
I started Franklin Furnace
after moving to New York- 1974-

694
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:53,862
because mywork
had been marginalized.

695
00:43:53,931 --> 00:44:01,497
- So I thought to start an institution
that would show marginalized work.
- ¢Ü...you wanna sit on my face ¢Ü

696

Butyou had to do it anyway,
oryou were gonna go nuts.

699
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,941
We started the Woman's Building,
and, after a year, I left that...

700
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:19,353
because I had become strengthened...

701
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:23,416
in my own sense ofwhat I wanted
to do and be as an artist.

Threeyears afterleaving,
Judy completed The Dinner Party.

703
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:34,366
[Chicago]
There's 39 place settings
at the table- 13 on each side.

704
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:42,211
Each ofthe place settings represents
a woman ofachievement
from Western civilization.

705
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:46,215
Over 400 people came
from all over the United States,

706
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:49,343
from as far away as Australia,
to work on the project.

707
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,554
In 1979, when The Dinner Party opened
in San Francisco- when it premiered-

00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:57,093
it wasn't just The Dinner Party
in the museum.

709

You got to see a glimpse ofwhat it would
actually mean to have a feminist society.

710

and to enhance

719
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:40,028
and to be the kind of person
I am here there.

720
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:43,596
I felt the need to have a more
total commitment to women...

00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,642
and to work for more long-range goals.

And I also was beginning, at the time,
to put out to the public...

the work I had been doing

[Leeson Narrating]Judywas
having success in museums,

726
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:08,397
but others were taking the lessons
ofpolitical activism directly to the streets.

727
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:12,060
These windows begin a series
that deal with aging.

They're also studies of the people
that shop at Bonwit Teller.

729
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:23,168
I began a very long period oftime
of straddling two lives-

730
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:29,345
the feminist information and life
that supported my growth as a woman...

731
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:32,911
and my community life,
which was within the Latino community,

732
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:35,720
as I worked intently in the neighborhoods.

733
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,286
And they never really met.

734
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:46,600
[Baca] The concept ofthe mural
was to bring a group ofyouths together
from different neighborhoods...

735
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,968
who had had trouble with the police...

736
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:52,600
and have them try to accomplish
something together...

737
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:55,236
that was greater
than any one ofthem individually.

738
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,713
And so we attempted to paint
the longest mural in the world.

739
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:03,712
But the idea was that we would paint
the history ofCalifornia...

740
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:07,052
and put particular emphasis
on the part ofhistory...

741
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,820
that had been left out in history books.

742
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:12,327
These kids are known for not
getting along with each other,

743
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:14,557
so we didn't know
what was going to happen.

744
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:16,963
It was an experiment,
and we think it worked.

[Baca]
Suzanne Lacy was trying
to figure out how the media...

746
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:24,832
could come to the services of putting
information to the public about rape.

747
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:30,141
The media surround
at that point in time was all fear-

748
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:37,114
showing women how to retreat, to hide,
to barricade, to defend...

around this manipulation ofinformation

sexual slaughter ofwomen.

751
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:49,658
And we wanted to interrupt that flow
in the media with another image.

752
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:56,297
[Lacy]
I am here forthe 388 women
who have been raped in Los Angeles...

753
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:59,934
between October 18
and November 29.

754
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:04,472
[Labowitz]
The thing that I really have learned,
and I'm gaining more confidence in,

755
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:08,848
is the potential of artists as image makers
to really make a change in society...

756
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:12,150
in terms ofthe images
that they project ofwomen.

757
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:16,989
And that that's just as important
as a political organization
and the things that they make.

758
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,996
We were sitting over coffee in Venice,
looking at the newspaper,

759
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,157
and just said, "This is it. We've had enough.

760
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:26,134
We have enough women around us.
We have other options.

761
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:32,574
We're going to organize and do something
to show the women of L.A.
that they don't need to be afraid."

762
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:35,968
[Leeson Narrating]
Suddenlyit was 1980-

763
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:38,412
[Film Projector Rolling]

764
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:41,375
[Brakes Screeching]

765
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:47,617
and it was as iftime was sliding backwards,
rewinding history in the process.

766
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:54,062
The Feminist Studio Workshop closed,
and the first cases ofAIDS were reported.

767
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:57,760
The E.R.A. was defeated in the Senate.

768
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:04,569
The planet's rage and disrepair
were background white noise
to our own private apocalypse.

769
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:09,442
A subculture that was no longer content
with remaining a footnote...

770
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:13,279
sought to become an implicit part
ofthe cultural narrative.

771
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:19,285
In 1984, the Museum of Modern Art
opened an exhibition...

772
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:22,689
called An International Survey
of Painting and Sculpture.

773
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:25,728
And in this exhibition,
there were 169 artists.

774
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,923
Very few were women
or people of color.

775
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:32,059
And we realized that we had
so much more to go.

776
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:37,072
So the Women's Caucus for Art called
a demonstration in front ofthe museum.

777
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:43,602
I remember that Frida Kahlo and I-
the Guerrilla Girl Frida Kahlo
and I, Kathe Kollwitz-

778
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,409
went to this demonstration.

779
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:50,647
So we're walking around on a picket line,
and nobody paid any attention to it.

780
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:55,416
We had this idea to do a kind of political art...

781
00:49:55,492 --> 00:50:00,361
that didn't just point to something
and complain and say, "This is wrong."

782
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:05,959
We had an idea to try
to twist issues around
and use facts and humor...

783
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:09,096
and change people's minds
about the issues.

784
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:14,609
This particular member misspelled
"Guerrilla" as "Gorilla,"

785
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:18,409
and so thatwas where the idea
ofthe masks came forth, and here we are.

786
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:19,972
[Woman: New Wave]

794
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:50,141
Artists and critics,
museum people, writers...

795
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:53,341
were part of the fact that women
were not being shown.

796
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:55,442
So we targeted them.

797
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:59,387
We named names,
and that was an extraordinary thing.

798
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:02,084
Not just generalize, but specific names.

799
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,189
We gave report cards-

800
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:08,754
how many people in this gallery
are women?

801
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:12,295
[Kollwitz]
We fingered one group after another.

802
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:17,602
We went after artists themselves-
successful male artists.
[Siren Wailing]

803
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:19,437
They've gotta speak up about this.

804
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:25,013
We travel in the dark of night,
in the mists.

805
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:28,518
It could be everybody.
The person next to you
could be a Guerrilla Girl,

806
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:32,681
so it's not clearwho is and isn't,
and hopefully it will stay that way.

807
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:37,758
[Laughing]
The penis count at the Met.

808
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:41,855
Someone had to do it,
and we were the ones.

809
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:45,993
[Guerrilla Girl #2]
We made them,
through the posters, accountable-

810
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:50,267
for how manywomen were in galleries,
how manywomen were in exhibitions,

811
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,399
how much moneywomen were making.

812
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:55,843
And we did it through humor
so that all ofus could laugh.

813
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:05,449
The feminists ofthe '70s had been
earnest and breast-beating,

814
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:07,752
and itjust didn'twork.

815
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:12,420
The bra-burning didn't actually
effect social change.

816
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:18,664
[Guerrilla Girl #3]
Itwas so difficult to be female
in the '60s and '70s.

817
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:26,198
To do feministworkwas just
the most profound leap of courage.

818
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:30,269
[Guerrilla Girl #2] I think
the influence ofthe feminist movement
on the artworld and on culture...

819
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:35,046
was the most profound thing that happened
in the last half ofthe 20th century.

820
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:39,950
Ifthe collectors
were really smart about it,

821
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:43,254
theywould purchase females' artwork...

822
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:47,057
because it's totally undervalued-
Mm-hmm, and it's an investment.

823
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,961
Yeah. It's a huge investment.

824
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:52,399
And remember that one posterwe did
where we named, I don't know,

825
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:58,840
Iike, 150 women artists thatyou
could purchase for one male artist.
Yeah.

826
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:00,604
That was a good poster.
That was a great poster.

827
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:05,273
They're mostly business people.
I'm just surprised they haven't
caught on to thatyet.

828
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:10,610
Tenets in the art world
that we believed were inviolate...

829
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:14,714
proved to be just the prejudices
ofthe people in power.

830
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:20,090
[Leeson Narrating]
But the existing powerstructure was shifting.

831
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:23,532
[Tucker]
The Whitney contacted me.

832
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:29,869
I was the first woman they had hired-
except for Margaret McKellar, the registrar-

833
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,501
the first woman
since Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney...

834
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:38,446
and certainly the first woman
in any- in a curatorial position.

835
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:43,418
Came through the '60s. Had read, you know,
all the writings of Bobby Seale.

836
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:45,954
I was supposed to, you know,
make a change-

837
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:49,014
go into the belly ofthe beast,
make an impact.

838
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:54,462
I want to change the power structures
that create inequities in the first place.

839
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:57,261
Curatorial workwas whereyou really
want to be in museums...

840
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:59,894
becauseyou affect the collection,
which stands.

841
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:02,063
There's an interesting
feminist story in this.

842
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:05,904
Because in those days,
David Salingerwas the president,

843
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:09,377
and he interviewed both me
and James Monte.

844
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:14,042
And he asked questions
that are illegal nowadays.

845
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:18,577
He wanted to know ifl had a boyfriend,
ifl intended to get married,

846
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:24,252
what I thought about a family-
um, really amazing stuff.

847
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:25,817
How old I was.

848
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:29,456
And at some point I just stopped him,
and I said, "Oh, okay.

849
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:31,966
Let me tell you whyyou don't
want to hire a woman.

850
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:35,129
You know, first, no man
will ever be able to work for me.

851
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:38,140
Secondly, we know
that women can't do budgets.

852
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:41,405
And third, once a month,
I'll go crazy and nobody
will be able to get near me."

853
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:44,276
And he actually laughed.

854
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:47,342
They hired us both.

855
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:52,218
But they hired me at $2,000 less a year,
which at that time was considerable.

856
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:58,155
So I went in to see my director
and I said, "This is what's happening,
and you've gotta change it."

857
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:01,095
And he said, "Well, you know"-
The budget, the budget, the budget.

858
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:04,895
And I said, "The New York Times,
the New York Post, the Daily News. "

859
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,697
So it got changed.

860
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,936
I feel like I'm in
the Witness Protection Program,

861
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:15,273
concealing my identity because I don't
wanna be whacked by the art mafia.

862
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:18,143
[Leeson]
Doyou think that the art mafia
reallywould punish someone...

863
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:21,911
ifthey found out that
theywere the ones who were
putting out these statistics?

864
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:26,422
Yes. Well, I think actually any subversive voice
is in danger ofbeing punished.

865
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,423
I think that's true anywhere.

866
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:31,686
I rememberwhen Susan Stamberg
interviewed me...

867
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:33,285
when the piece opened
in the San Francisco Museum.

868
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:36,298
And she said, "Well,Judy, what areyou
going to do when the controversy starts?"

869
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:38,163
And I go, "Controversy?
What controversy?"

870
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:39,826
I mean, 5,000 people
came to the opening.

871
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:41,996
People were giving me
necklaces and flowers.

872
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:46,668
I mean, it was just this incredible, festive,
gala celebration ofwomen's achievement...

873
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:48,904
and, you know, my achievement
and our achievement.

874
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:51,469
And I thought-whew!
You know, fantastic.

875
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:54,312
We really are at a moment in history
where women can enter the culture,

876
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:57,547
we can be ourselves, we can in fact
bring our point ofview into the world.

877
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,884
Ha, ha, ha!

878
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:05,954
Nobodywas prepared for the ferocity
ofthe assault on The DinnerParty-

879
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:09,260
not anybody associated
with The Dinner Party and not me.

880
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:13,462
Museum after museum backed out
of exhibiting The Dinner Party.

881
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:17,438
On the floor of Congress, people were
speaking against this work of art...

882
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:19,407
that most ofthem had never seen.

883
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:22,843
...smash your face till it bled,
you get a letter of reproach.

884
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:24,743
And now we have this pornographic art.

885
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:33,587
I mean, three-dimensional ceramic art of
39 women's, uh, vaginal area- their genitalia-

886
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:36,056
served up on plates
that requires a whole room.

887
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:40,222
...in order to displayweird sexual art.

888
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:44,255
I'm a poet, and I do have trouble
with this, 'cause it's not art!

889
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:46,700
It is not art. It's pornography!

890
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:53,140
Pornographic art- Militaryweapons
that look like phallic symbols,

891
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:57,543
capable of doing nothing
but destroying human life on this planet!

892
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:59,912
You wanna talk about pornography?

893
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:02,679
You wanna talk about deadly art?

894
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,346
We deal with pornography
every single day!

895
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,117
That's not the issue.

896
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:13,789
They're not going to display
a mobile M.X. missile or a B-2 bomber.

897
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:19,194
They're gonna feature a work
that has 39 elaborate place settings...

898
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,328
depicting female vaginas.

899
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:25,363
I came to this body against the backdrop
ofthe Civil Rights movement,

900
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:28,843
and people said, "Challenge,
come here so thatyou can speak out."

901
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:31,403
Look at this garbage.

902
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:36,282
Art is a precious expression of
the First Amendment to the Constitution.

903
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:39,378
For Congress to spend an hour and 27 minutes
discussing The DinnerParty?

904
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,117
I mean, when are they
running the country?

905
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:47,391
123 members voting in the negative
and one membervoting "present,"

906
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,523
the amendment is agreed to.

907
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,661
All men discussed
the future of The DinnerParty.
Not one woman spoke up.

908
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:59,606
Men determined
and decided that The Dinner Party
was not going to enter history.

[Leeson]
And why did you leave?

910
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,470
Oh, why did I leave the Whitney?
I got fired.

911
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:06,777
Why did I get fired?
I have no idea.

912
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:09,910

give me a straight answer either.

913
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:14,013
But I suspect it was maybe because
I was more than just competent.

00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:17,021

It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter because-

916
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:24,222
Although it was extremely painful,
because I was there for eightyears.

917
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,895
And I loved the institution. Loved it.

918
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:30,371
That was hard. That was hard.

919
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,841
But I got over it. [Laughing]
I just got over it.

920
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:37,972
Because I'm a refugee from the Nazis...

921
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:42,780
and because I came here and was adopted
by this country and became naturalized.

922
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:47,983
A countrywhich I had, you know,
such admiration for.

923
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:53,120
Here's a land that was really one
ofthe only countries in the world...

924
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:58,498
whereyou could totally, totally,
freely express yourselfin everyway.

925
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:05,201
And to see these kinds ofthings
being eroded and nibbled at...

926
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:11,077
and that these forces are really
and truly trying to destroy that,

927
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:15,140
is to me just immensely frightening.

928
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:19,314
The kinds ofsystemic battle lines
that were drawn were really clear...

929
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:22,381
at the time ofAna Mendieta's death.

930
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:29,388
[Leeson Narrating]
Ana Mendieta fell to her death
from a 34th-floorwindow.

931
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:38,873
Herhusband, the minimalist sculptor Carl Andre,
was charged with second-degree murder.

932
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:43,003
[Rich] Some of the best-known
feminist art critics and feminist artists...

933
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,944
wouldn't come to her defense.

934
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:52,982
Theywere too connected to Carl Andre
from the early days of minimalism...

935
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:55,650
to be willing to go against
that male establishment...

936
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:58,853
that immediately
closed ranks around him.

937

for his very expensive defense attorney-

Rauschenberg, all the rest ofthem.

939
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:13,599
Even the Guerrilla Girls
were so split by differences...

940
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:17,237
that theyweren't even able to put out
a fucking poster in her defense.

There was a lot of activism, both in
the art world, and certainly in the culture,

945
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,890
around the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings.

Marcia Tucker organized
the Bad Girls exhibition in New York.

01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:40,186
Others followed in Los Angeles and London.

964
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:44,563
I was seeing a lot of work
that was real ly funny...

965
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:51,506
and was about somehow subverting
some of the, uh, the methods...

or some of the attitudes
that created sexism.

Humor is the single most subversive
weapon we have.

971
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:17,198
The reactions to the exhibition I organized
at the UCLA Hammer Museum in 1996-

972
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:24,502
which was called Sexual Politics: Judy Chicago's
DinnerParty and Feminist Art History-

973
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,042
were deeply disturbing and upsetting.

974
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:32,912
A certain coalition of Los Angeles art critics
wrote these incredibly hostile reviews.

975
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:39,615
It also incited negativity
on the part of older feminists...

[Leeson Narrating]
External frustrations mounted
and triggered internal animosity.

978
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:52,600
When women were isolated
from the rest of society...

979
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:56,468
and marginalized on account
of being- feminism,

980
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:59,736
this infighting started to take place.

981
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:04,542
I think it was Miriam Schapiro, but it
may have been Judy too. I don't know.

982
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:09,608
Started speaking very badly about-
I think it was Barbara Kruger...

983
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:11,619
or one ofthe more famous ones.

984
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:14,315
And I remember getting up
and objecting publicly.

985
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:18,292
A damage that's inherent within
an artwork, they call "inherent vice."

986
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:23,822
I think these conflicts
are a kind ofan inherent vice
thatyou'll have no matterwhat...

987
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:28,496
because the playing field itself
has never been level.

988
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:34,776
Look at what low esteem Carolee Schneemann
or Hannah Wilke were held
by a lot ofwomen artists.

989
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:38,575
Like, "Oh, you shouldn't do that.
You shouldn't make a spectacle
ofyourselflike that."

990
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:41,879
A lot of us who survived those fights-

991
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:45,182
bloodied, but, you know,
relatively unscarred-

992
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:49,156
are kind oflike the old C.I.A. and K.G.B. agents
that get together for reunions.

993
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:51,887
Who else knows
what we were fighting over?

994
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:54,361
Who else is interested in these issues...

995
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:59,231
that have really been consigned
to a sort ofhistoric scrap pile...

996
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:02,465
that people don't seem
all that concerned about anymore?

997
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:07,840
The feminist art movement was always
incredibly heterogeneous and...

998
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,468
richly conflicted,

999
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:15,484
and that's what made it the most important
political movement in the art world...

1000
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:17,382
in the contemporary period.

1001
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:21,150
My students react against
feminism and feminist art,

1002
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:26,787
and they take up the worst
of 1950s behavior ofwomen.

1003
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:31,232
I go back to the 1950s and think
ofhow we were raised,

1004
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:34,167
and I seeyoung girls
mimicking that.

1005
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:36,296
I do. It's horrifying.

1006
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:40,172
That term has become kind ofa red herring...

1007
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:45,078
that now gets brought out
by major institutions to kind of-

1008
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:48,139
"Oh, well, now we've done
our feminist show and we can move on."

1009
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:54,554
I don't think feminism successfully
changed the structures...

1010
01:04:54,624 --> 01:05:00,790
through which art is made, sold,
displayed and written about.

1011
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:08,762
I think for complex and maybe
in some ways obvious reasons,

1012
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:13,537
I think a lot ofwomen
just wanted to be included.

1013
01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:16,735
I think there's a fearwithin my generation...

1014
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:22,580
that identifying with feminism
is a limitation and not a foundation.

1015
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:26,886

was the access to information...

that was implicit in this movement.

1017
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:38,798
Ideas introduced in the '70s were amplified
byyounger artists ofthe '80s.

Mira Schorwas my professor,

"Haveyou ever heard

01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:05,918
And I looked at this work and I thought,
"I'm making thework ofthe '70s."

and just being completely blown away
by the critique.

1043
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:21,392
The art I'm doing currently is very related
to the feminist movement...

1044
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:24,337
in terms ofhow I consider the body.

Historyis fragile.

1047
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:45,619
It clings to the most obvious evidence
that remains.

1048
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:10,176
This film is patched together like a quilt
from people I could access,

1049
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:12,743
events that I heard about,

1050
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:20,058
and it represents only a nanocell
in the D.N.A. ofan international experience,

1051
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:22,825
most ofwhich is not included.

1052
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:27,593
I know how much is left out ofthis film.

1053
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:35,777
What questions are asked
in determining histories?

1054
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:40,646
Perhaps more importantly,
what questions aren't asked?

1055
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:44,948
Some of the things that you're asking
are the things that got left out.

1056
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:50,185
The connection to the late '60s movements
I think gets left out.

1057
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:56,095
One ofthe things the film does
is to open up a set of problems...

1058
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:59,601
that the 1970s raised without solving them.

1059
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:04,799
And I think that's one ofthe important
parts offeminist practice-

1060
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:07,206
is not to shut down the questions.

One ofthe vestiges offreedom

1064
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:27,121
is to choose our attitudes,

1068
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:50,608
On the cusp ofeverypotential disaster,
there was a reinvention...

1069
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:54,952
and an absolute resolve
to preserve an enduring future.

1070
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:58,616
I began to shoot this film 40years ago.

I've been waiting all this time
for the right ending.

Marcia, how long did it take you...

1073
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:18,671
to accomplish your dream
of opening the New Museum?

1074
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:21,648
Well, over a weekend basically.

1075
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:26,450
No. I got fired in December.

1076
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:28,387
I packed up my stuff,

1077
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:33,485
and I left just before New Year's weekend.

1078
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:37,396
And I rented this little space
in the Fine Arts Building,

1079
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:41,960
and then I opened the space-
open for business- the day after New Year's.

1080
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:47,998
I took the model for the museum
from consciousness-raising groups,
community groups.

1081
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:51,308
I learned a lot from feminism.

1082
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:58,684
[Leeson Narrating]
Overthe weekendbetween December 1976
andJanuary 1977, as she modestlysays,

1083
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:00,881
Marcia Tucker created the New Museum,

1084
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:05,188
a still thriving exhibition space
for contemporary art in New York.

1087
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:16,997
[Grode] One of the great successes
was having the Hollywood
Women's Political Committee...

1088
01:11:17,072 --> 01:11:21,509
impress upon the Senate ofthe United States
that even though the House of Representatives...

1089
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:30,645
had decided to actually put forth a bill
keeping The Dinner Party from being
shown in Washington, D.C.-

1090
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,949
When this very powerful
group ofwomen...

1091
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:36,719
Iet it be known to the senators
who they had supported foryears...

1092
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:38,726
that this was not to happen,

1093
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:40,955
it died right then and there
in the Senate.

1094
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,759
It was an incredible moment,

1095
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:45,732
a moment that probably people
will never really know about,

1096
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:50,295
but nonetheless was proofto us
how political it sometimes had to be.

1097
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:55,776
In 1992, the Women's Action Coalition
was formed to mobilize and do activist work...

1098
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:59,336
around cultural issues and issues of parity
within the art world.

1099
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:02,942
So, it was this kind offull circle
moment ofactivism.

01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:06,215

In 2006, Connie Butler
organizedan exhibition...

1101
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:11,351
that opened at the Museum
ofContemporary Art in Los Angeles.

1102
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:16,387
[Butler]
The exhibition has a title. It's called
WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution.

1103
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:19,229
Many of the artists said, "You know,
it's gonna be career suicide".

can absorb this much art bywomen,

sociopolitical art bywomen.

1111
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:47,718
[Rosler]
What's important about the WACK! show
is that it's the beginning of rectification...

1112
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:51,232
of a completely falsified
history ofthat era...

1113
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:59,264
which tried to reduce, contain
and fragment the production ofwomen.

1122
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:22,062
It's incredible.

1123
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:25,328
It's an irreducible transformation
of our history.

1124
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,766
You know, I'm thrilled.

1125
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:32,774
I actually confess I didn't think such
an enormous exhibition would come ofit,

1126
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:36,140
which is one ofthe exciting things.

1127
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:39,476
I intend to come back to this show
probably another 10 times before
I leave the country...

1128
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:41,743
because there's so many hours ofvideo,

1129
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:46,777
and there's just always something else
that needs to be looked at a little bit more.

1130
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:52,282
[Leeson Narrating]
When artists are battling
forspace in the cultural memory,

1131
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:57,765
omission- or even worse, eradication-
becomes a kind ofmurder.

I have been overwhel med
by the reaction to it.

1134
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:06,966
[Leeson Narrating]
The WA CK! exhibition
traveled to several cities...

1135
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:11,638
and spawned hundreds ofsatellite
exhibitions and reunions.

1136
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:15,376
The Sackler Center for Feminist Art
opened at the Brooklyn Museum ofArt,

1137
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:19,478
and the Feminist Art Project
opened at Rutgers University.

1138
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:26,221
This is what the timeline ofthis film looks like.

1139
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:31,756
I realized that the timeline for this film
is, in fact, my own timeline.

1140

[Chattering]

1141
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:39,936
Publishing articles about myself
resulted in an exhibition,

1142
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:44,468
and, in 1975, I actually sold some work.

1143
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:48,004
When the buyer learned that I was female,
he returned the work,

1144
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:51,280
saying buying women artists
was a bad investment.

1145
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:55,050
I sold nothing for the next 17 years.

1146
01:14:55,657 --> 01:15:00,219
Work accumulated and was stored
under beds or in closets.

1147
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:08,266
To preserve it, I offered to donate these pieces,
plus 50 others, to a local museum.

1148
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:12,933
They rejected it. They said it wasn't art
and that I didn't know myplace,

1149
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:16,910
and, ifl didn't take it back in three days,
they would destroy it.

1150
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:25,278
Thirty-five years later, that work was appraised
for 9, 000 times the original sale price.

1151
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:29,586
And it was that sale, along with
some enlightened philanthropists,

1152
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:32,627
that enabled the completion ofthis film.

1153
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:37,996
I trust that each successive generation
will recreate itself.

1154
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:42,799
Women of the '70s worked very hard
for something that I 'm benefiting from,

1155
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:47,899
that I feel like I have support,
that I'm part of a dialogue.

1156
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:52,208
We still have the capacity to respond
to our own context in making art.

1157
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:56,877
That relentless communication
on a visual level is very powerful.

1158
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:59,045
Things have changed a lot.

1159
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:01,453
I thinkwe still have
a lot ofwork to do.

01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:06,786
[Leeson Narrating]
A legacyis a gift to the future.

1161
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:14,500
The permanent manifestation
ofwomen's community
is very important to me.

1162
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:20,104
I can't believe it,

1163
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:26,171
but this last year
in my careerwas the best,

1164
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:30,383
at the age of 81.

1165
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:35,185
So ifwe suffer and make it into art,
sometimes that makes sense out ofsuffering,

1166
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:43,096
and the pain becomes a work that possibly
also gets us out of our own tragedy.

1167
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:51,036
Everywoman's fame, everywoman's success,
is all of our success.
