Lovely evening.
- Make it short. How much will you pay?

27
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:16,622
Depends on what you're offering.
- 50, plus 20 for specials.

28
00:03:18,424 --> 00:03:21,900
That's pricy.
- And rent for a room on top of that.

29
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,582
What is it, yes or no?
- Alright, "normal".

30
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:33,493
How about that?
I thought it can't be true.

31
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:37,850
This drunk bursts right
into my performance.

32
00:03:38,276 --> 00:03:42,307
I couldn't believe it!
In my performance!

33
00:03:43,164 --> 00:03:48,411
Had Johnny not been there...
Johnny was simply marvelous.

34
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:52,119
You get a kiss for that.

35
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,520
It grates on my nerves, really!

36
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,378
Leave me alone!

37
00:04:18,365 --> 00:04:23,900
Dear Erich, I admire your endurance.
You're at my show every evening.

38
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,800
Don't you get bored?

39
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,594
I'm always there when János' playing.

40
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:33,061
It's not good to be home all alone.

41
00:04:36,905 --> 00:04:41,162
<i>I'll let you have it if I ever catch
you again doing it for 30 bucks.</i>

42
00:04:41,412 --> 00:04:45,006
<i>Stop bragging and take
a look in the mirror.</i>

43
00:04:45,472 --> 00:04:50,201
Find yourself another corner!
You're bad for business!

44
00:04:51,864 --> 00:04:53,643
Get lost!
- Get lost!

45
00:04:54,596 --> 00:04:58,254
Tell me Rolf, when will you graduate?

46
00:04:58,717 --> 00:05:03,256
I'm very interested.
How did you like my show?

47
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:07,445
You were great, Ms Sheira.

48
00:05:07,695 --> 00:05:11,802
I know your records but seeing
you live is something else.

49
00:05:12,052 --> 00:05:16,136
You're just...
- Awesome! It's true!

50
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:21,083
You're really good, no matter
what anyone says.

51
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,228
I think you're awesome.

52
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:26,879
"Vox populi" what is your name?

53
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:29,359
My name's Lisi.

54
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:34,029
Lisi... Lisa... Elisabeth!

55
00:05:34,515 --> 00:05:38,481
Yes, Ms Sheira.
- Bring us a clean ashtray.

56
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,769
Let's go car racing.
You come with us!

57
00:05:58,019 --> 00:05:59,816
I get changed.

58
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,472
Sorry!
- Never mind.

59
00:06:13,732 --> 00:06:18,471
Take them with you.
Maybe you can make someone happy.

60
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:22,692
I feel bad for the flowers
because they have no light here.

61
00:06:32,437 --> 00:06:33,418
Asshole!

62
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:38,147
Oh, what have you done?
The sweetie got scared.

63
00:06:38,546 --> 00:06:40,888
What are you doing this late?

64
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:45,573
Could I... have an autograph?

65
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:49,194
I'd love to. What's your name?
- Rosy.

66
00:06:49,794 --> 00:06:52,834
"To Rosy." What a lovely name.

67
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,342
Thanks.

68
00:06:55,592 --> 00:06:59,850
Rolf, now you know who
you can give the roses to.

69
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,957
Ask her if she want's to tag along.
She seems like a nice girl.

70
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,676
Dear miss, may I escort you?

71
00:07:15,871 --> 00:07:19,257
You're an artist too?
- No I'm from the other side...

72
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:20,936
of the stage.

73
00:07:35,452 --> 00:07:39,310
That's the second time
you're outdistanced.

74
00:07:40,254 --> 00:07:43,467
I'll throw you out
in the next turn.

75
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:54,719
I'm sorry madam, I didn't mean to.

76
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:57,488
It's my fault. I'm simply too stupid.

77
00:07:57,738 --> 00:08:02,571
Slow driving can tie up traffic too.
- I don't even bother with you.

78
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,669
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!
The Grand Prix of Germany</i>

79
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,352
<i>ended without any major accidents.</i>

80
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:15,184
<i>The winner is János Góré.</i>

81
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:22,931
<i>Ms Lisi Hoffering won second place,
with Arthur Sandmeier on third.</i>

82
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:28,917
<i>Fourth and last is Ms Helen Sheira.
Bravo!</i>

83
00:08:29,653 --> 00:08:33,247
<i>The last shall be first.
Give it up for her!</i>

84
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:34,853
May I?

85
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:42,801
Cheers!

86
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:45,815
One second...

87
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:48,429
Here's to you!

88
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:56,716
I want to go home.
- Me too, let's...   - Go home, right.

89
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,174
May I... take you home?

90
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,358
Watch out, he's a sleazebag
who defiles girls.

91
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,852
It was a joke.
- Certainly.

92
00:09:14,315 --> 00:09:18,290
Let him accompany you home.
- I have no home.

93
00:09:20,836 --> 00:09:23,859
But... that's...

94
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:26,387
That's nobody's business.

95
00:09:26,818 --> 00:09:31,139
Does this mean you have
no place to stay for tonight?

96
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,361
Yes.

97
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:35,338
It's simple.
Stay with us.

98
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:39,741
You can sleep in the visitor's gap.
- Stay out of it.

99
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:44,440
Our flat is not your flat
and sadly my flat is too small.

100
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,190
But...
- Let me handle it.

101
00:09:47,594 --> 00:09:49,936
Lisi, take him away.
- Come, darling.

102
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:55,447
If you need money...

103
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:58,242
Would you pay the bill, please.

104
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:03,453
I'd love to help you but
it's not possible in my place.

105
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,791
That's no problem.

106
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:10,729
There's a vacant room in the
boardinghouse I'm staying.

107
00:10:11,683 --> 00:10:14,770
I know for sure.
I'll take her there.

108
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:17,093
And we'll take it from there.

109
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,072
Rolf!

110
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,770
What should I do, Rolf?

111
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:24,572
I don't know. Don't let
them intimidate you.

112
00:13:27,168 --> 00:13:29,174
I'm worried about it too.

113
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:35,510
I still have a lot to
do for my studies.

114
00:13:37,535 --> 00:13:39,885
I don't have much time for you.

115
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:44,987
Maybe the juvenile center
isn't a bad idea.

116
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,560
Are you crazy?
You want me to...

117
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,578
Listen, I looked into it. They've
also dormitories for young girls.

118
00:13:57,005 --> 00:13:59,737
They're giving guidance
and help you find work.

119
00:13:59,987 --> 00:14:04,185
You'd even have permission to go out
if you follow the house rules.

120
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,804
Rolf!

121
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:13,077
You'd learn a trade and
we could see each other.

122
00:14:13,327 --> 00:14:17,170
It wouldn't be forever.
- You're just like all the others.

123
00:14:18,173 --> 00:14:22,221
You try to shunt me off
into one of those Christian places...

124
00:14:22,471 --> 00:14:26,828
Praying all day and no smoking.
And everything's a sin.

125
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,278
God this and God that
and Jesus once in a while.

126
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:36,454
No, thanks! I'd rather
go somewhere else entirely.

127
00:14:44,963 --> 00:14:47,187
We have a customer, Director.

128
00:14:52,507 --> 00:14:55,148
What unexpected glamor in my house.

129
00:14:58,216 --> 00:15:00,785
A bottle of champagne.
- Gosh!

130
00:16:06,826 --> 00:16:10,793
<i>Yeah, men...
They suck!</i>

131
00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:14,487
<i>They come and
they throw themselves at you.</i>

132
00:16:14,737 --> 00:16:17,029
<i>How they show off
with their cars!</i>

133
00:16:17,898 --> 00:16:20,149
<i>If you've got it, flaunt it!</i>

134
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,769
<i>I think it sucks!</i>

135
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,279
<i>It's nice for amusement</i>

136
00:16:31,513 --> 00:16:35,852
<i>but hopping into bed?
No!</i>

137
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:41,453
<i>I rather fall asleep
next to a teddy bear.</i>

138
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:51,061
<i>Yeah, women...
They suck!</i>

139
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:57,116
<i>She comes along and pinches my man,
bragging to the others.</i>

140
00:16:58,314 --> 00:17:00,719
<i>If you've got it, flaunt it!</i>

141
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,725
<i>I think it sucks!</i>

142
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:10,227
<i>It's nice for amusement</i>

143
00:17:12,487 --> 00:17:16,708
<i>but hopping into bed?
No!</i>

144
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:22,699
<i>I rather fall asleep
next to a teddy bear.</i>

145
00:17:28,201 --> 00:17:32,304
<i>Being alone...
sucks!</i>

146
00:17:32,812 --> 00:17:36,048
<i>If you don't have a man it's the worst. </i>

147
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:38,994
<i>The boredom... it sucks!</i>

148
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,177
<i>And than you take any man,
and than you take a guy...</i>

149
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,773
<i>And he sucks.</i>

150
00:17:48,217 --> 00:17:51,784
<i>It's nice for amusement</i>

151
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,737
<i>Even in bed I don't say "no".</i>

152
00:18:00,616 --> 00:18:05,945
<i>I rather fall asleep
next to the teddy bear.</i>

153
00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:15,736
Never drink champagne with a straw.

154
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:19,694
Get some fresh air
and you'll be alright.

155
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:32,150
Come.

156
00:18:38,904 --> 00:18:43,261
My god, how terrible.
This never happened to me before.

157
00:18:44,886 --> 00:18:47,300
What am I supposed to do?

158
00:18:49,457 --> 00:18:51,872
Hold you breath and
hold your nose.

159
00:18:59,407 --> 00:19:00,515
Sorry.

160
00:19:07,223 --> 00:19:10,155
You're next.
Close your mouth!

161
00:19:12,855 --> 00:19:14,616
What do you think of that?

162
00:19:15,415 --> 00:19:16,758
No more hiccup.

163
00:19:17,008 --> 00:19:19,835
It's an old trick. It's psychological.

164
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:22,028
It's just a blank gun.

165
00:19:23,158 --> 00:19:26,253
Helen's scared at night
when the customers have all left.

166
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:31,002
You frightened me, Mr...?
- Call me Johnny.

167
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,788
Why are you called "Director"?

168
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:42,799
I am the director.

169
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:47,737
But I thought the bar is owned by...
- Artistic director.

170
00:19:48,218 --> 00:19:51,595
It's even on the poster.
- I didn't know that.

171
00:19:52,584 --> 00:19:55,798
But Ms Sheira...
- Who made her? Who invented her?

172
00:19:56,717 --> 00:20:00,076
Nobody gave a damn about her
until I took care of her.

173
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,870
It was a lot of work to get her where
she's today. And what do I get?

174
00:20:06,823 --> 00:20:09,328
I slave away to keep the bar going

175
00:20:10,082 --> 00:20:13,885
and she makes the money.
A lot of it!

176
00:20:14,294 --> 00:20:18,941
Helen's busy. Movies, records, TV...

177
00:20:20,223 --> 00:20:21,921
And Johnny gets only peanuts.

178
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:27,694
Ms Sheira was a star when I was still
in school. My mother knows her too.

179
00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:30,499
And you grandmother probably too...

180
00:20:31,243 --> 00:20:33,243
She's not getting any younger.

181
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:44,150
Evenin'. The lady you're looking for...
got the giggles.

182
00:20:45,884 --> 00:20:48,034
She's out for fresh air.

183
00:20:48,284 --> 00:20:52,406
Why don't you bring her back
so she won't catch a cold?

184
00:20:53,508 --> 00:20:55,469
Ladies and gentlemen...

185
00:20:56,427 --> 00:20:59,477
Like that?
- Almost. Wait a sec...

186
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:06,654
Yes... another one.

187
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,593
That wasn't bad.

188
00:21:23,078 --> 00:21:26,691
Stop! Cut the scene.
I don't like how it's directed.

189
00:21:28,411 --> 00:21:32,623
Oh, the faculty member
has an opinion too.

190
00:21:33,063 --> 00:21:36,131
Don't be a drag.
It was just for fun.

191
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:40,801
Keep your hands off of her, or else!
- Oh, really?

192
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:44,250
Really!
- Don't bite off more than you can chew.

193
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,961
You're not renting her. First come...
- First serve!

194
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:53,639
I'm warning you!
Rosy isn't even sixteen.

195
00:22:04,444 --> 00:22:07,422
What do you say, not even sixteen...

196
00:22:07,832 --> 00:22:09,547
It's not working.

197
00:22:11,118 --> 00:22:13,405
Helen, what you're doing is stale.

198
00:22:13,777 --> 00:22:15,638
Give me a cigarette.

199
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:20,549
The way you're standing there.
Outrageous!

200
00:22:21,997 --> 00:22:24,751
Show some effort.
- So I don't get a cigarette?

201
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:28,414
No, let's get to work.
You're smoking too much anyway.

202
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:32,018
You're voice sounds
like a rusty toilet lid.

203
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,606
Thank you!

204
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:37,459
My voice is alright.

205
00:22:38,494 --> 00:22:41,953
Not in this song. You sing
like your own grandma.

206
00:22:47,448 --> 00:22:50,098
Thanks, my grandma was a soprano.

207
00:22:50,348 --> 00:22:52,867
And I'm old, yeah yeah, I know...

208
00:22:55,156 --> 00:22:57,643
Helen, I only want the best for you.

209
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,168
You could do a bit of a
Sandie Shaw impression.

210
00:23:02,522 --> 00:23:05,164
I never once performed barefooted.

211
00:23:05,414 --> 00:23:09,144
If I do an impression,
it's Helen Sheira

212
00:23:12,602 --> 00:23:14,862
One more time from the beginning.

213
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:22,405
Alright, if you don't want nothing
to do with me, do it yourself!

214
00:23:23,263 --> 00:23:26,131
But it's not my fault if the song flops.

215
00:23:44,532 --> 00:23:49,579
<i>Rosy's in the right age,
everyone's pushing her buttons.</i>

216
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:53,781
<i>The whole gang,
those youngsters brag...</i>

217
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:58,869
Are we interrupting your work?

218
00:23:59,758 --> 00:24:03,162
No no, keep on singing.
I'm not even listening.

219
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:08,827
Please clean the glasses
in the kitchen first, Ms Ruland.

220
00:24:12,488 --> 00:24:14,875
One can't even work in peace.

221
00:24:15,484 --> 00:24:20,022
Tonight you can see me doing the dishes
and I make everyone's bed... sorry.

222
00:24:21,509 --> 00:24:23,361
The last verse, one more time.

223
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:30,609
<i>Rosy's in the right age,
everyone's pushing her buttons.</i>

224
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:35,788
<i>The whole gang,
those youngsters brag...</i>

225
00:24:36,205 --> 00:24:37,422
<i>and go hard.</i>

226
00:24:38,525 --> 00:24:40,822
<i>Remember: Hand's off!</i>

227
00:24:43,931 --> 00:24:47,716
See, you can do it. Good girl.

228
00:24:49,504 --> 00:24:52,146
I had to top the cleaning woman.

229
00:24:53,385 --> 00:24:56,571
Reconciliation?
So the pianist can leave. Good night.

230
00:24:57,056 --> 00:24:59,271
I have to talk to you.

231
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:02,557
Pay raise?
- Idiot.

232
00:25:18,874 --> 00:25:23,458
What are you whispering?
- Can't say, it's a birthday surprise.

233
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:27,717
I almost forgot.
- You gave it away. Get lost!

234
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:32,242
I'll write you a brand new chanson
for tomorrows party.

235
00:25:35,344 --> 00:25:38,476
Party? It's sweet that you
remembered my birthday.

236
00:25:41,716 --> 00:25:45,211
What are you doing?
- I'm playing cleaning woman.

237
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,500
Ms Ruland...
- That'll cost a few new glasses.

238
00:25:53,017 --> 00:25:55,677
Well, at least it's not our money.

239
00:25:57,096 --> 00:26:00,455
Speaking of... for tomorrow?
- Take it from my purse.

240
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:05,384
You spend too much.

241
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:20,151
What're you doing? That's illegal.
- Don't worry, it was my idea.

242
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,702
Rosy, Count Perleberg.
- Evenin'

243
00:27:26,952 --> 00:27:28,517
Very charming.

244
00:27:39,322 --> 00:27:41,609
How about a game of "Chicago"?

245
00:27:48,739 --> 00:27:54,031
I never would've thought that of you.
- You think too much.

246
00:27:57,858 --> 00:28:00,890
I'll spend these 20.
But low stakes, please.

247
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:09,384
Can't you take him away?
He's bad luck.

248
00:28:10,265 --> 00:28:13,805
Alright, Chicago.
- Let the kids enjoy themselves.

249
00:28:17,277 --> 00:28:20,127
May I introduce you
to counsel Ms Zeisig.

250
00:28:23,204 --> 00:28:26,009
It's a pleasure meeting you, counsel.

251
00:28:27,189 --> 00:28:29,277
God, I have to pick up Helen.

252
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:21,210
What a surprise! I had no idea!

253
00:29:22,175 --> 00:29:25,997
May I put your present on you.
- Johnny!

254
00:29:26,963 --> 00:29:28,524
Are you crazy?

255
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:33,397
Do you like it?

256
00:29:35,898 --> 00:29:38,693
Happy birthday, madam.
- You two know each other?

257
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,090
Only by sight.
- Only by sight.

258
00:29:41,766 --> 00:29:44,426
I'm delighted.
- Delightful.

259
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:51,964
My present for you. A portrait.

260
00:29:56,189 --> 00:30:02,671
Terrific! How can I thank you for this?
May I put it up in the bar?

261
00:30:03,342 --> 00:30:05,929
Of course, madam.

262
00:30:16,466 --> 00:30:17,854
Blow it out.

263
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:26,214
How old are you?

264
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:31,702
A man is as old as he feels, and
a woman is as old as she feels like.

265
00:30:35,044 --> 00:30:36,832
That's no invitation.

266
00:30:40,717 --> 00:30:42,786
Cheers!
- Cheers!

267
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,532
A song!

268
00:30:50,325 --> 00:30:55,236
<i>In the past we were
in the Garden of Eden.</i>

269
00:30:56,915 --> 00:31:01,654
<i>Nowadays we don't have it as good.</i>

270
00:31:03,767 --> 00:31:08,156
<i>Back then you could
flirt with every man,</i>

271
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:14,664
<i>because the one man good enough.</i>

272
00:31:18,817 --> 00:31:23,528
<i>But then we were kicked out.</i>

273
00:31:25,026 --> 00:31:29,891
<i>It seems that heaven
was not good enough.</i>

274
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:35,844
<i>If we have finally realized
that nowadays,</i>

275
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:42,226
<i>it is nothing more than self-delusion.</i>

276
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:48,689
<i>Because in paradise,</i>

277
00:31:52,306 --> 00:31:56,299
<i>the lady was naked - with a leaf</i>

278
00:31:58,713 --> 00:32:02,775
<i>And when Adam pinched the lady's bum,</i>

279
00:32:06,261 --> 00:32:08,930
<i>she was like "Oh!"</i>

280
00:32:09,752 --> 00:32:12,761
<i>Those were the times,
those were the times.</i>

281
00:32:13,011 --> 00:32:15,579
<i>That's how it was.</i>

282
00:32:21,627 --> 00:32:28,148
<i>Nowadays we've built on bare ground,</i>

283
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:31,597
<i>houses and culture.</i>

284
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:39,895
<i>Complaints were lodged
against some of those houses.</i>

285
00:32:40,145 --> 00:32:44,002
<i>One could live in them,
and not only that...</i>

286
00:32:50,313 --> 00:32:53,962
<i>And then we were kicked out.</i>

287
00:32:56,875 --> 00:33:00,279
<i>We had to live on the street.</i>

288
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:07,859
<i>Soon we will be forgotten.</i>

289
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:13,051
<i>Soon we'll take to the air anyways.</i>

290
00:33:22,813 --> 00:33:28,668
<i>And in paradise, the ladies will
again be naked - with a leaf.</i>

291
00:33:31,804 --> 00:33:38,875
<i>And if nobody pinches the women's bums
I'll be like "Oh!"</i>

292
00:33:41,442 --> 00:33:44,637
<i>Those were the times,
those were the times.</i>

293
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:47,233
<i>That's how it was.</i>

294
00:33:52,547 --> 00:33:54,254
The show continues!

295
00:33:54,504 --> 00:33:56,977
Highlight after highlight!

296
00:33:57,227 --> 00:34:01,717
Now we'll play "Undress
and body painting". Who get's undressed?

297
00:34:46,908 --> 00:34:50,303
Up next we'll auction off
this living painting.

298
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:52,745
Front

299
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:56,825
and backside. Oh, sorry.
Only the front.

300
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:03,642
Make a bid! Going, going...
- I keep it. My work is not for sale.

301
00:35:50,901 --> 00:35:51,918
Music!

302
00:36:42,338 --> 00:36:45,279
No way, don't you
run off with my money.

303
00:36:48,438 --> 00:36:49,427
Johnny.

304
00:36:50,535 --> 00:36:56,153
Call a taxi. The girl's plastered.
- It's my fault. I'll take her home.

305
00:37:05,668 --> 00:37:07,257
Where's my lighter?

306
00:37:08,056 --> 00:37:11,596
My lighter was stolen. A french one
with diamonds.

307
00:37:11,927 --> 00:37:13,842
It cost 1400 <i>Mark</i>.

308
00:37:17,246 --> 00:37:18,534
You're a pig

309
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,441
Is it this one?

310
00:37:25,518 --> 00:37:27,887
See, nothing gets lost.

311
00:38:01,227 --> 00:38:05,475
Johnny, my ring.
- Sorry, the ring is part of the prelude.

312
00:38:06,364 --> 00:38:07,499
Get out!

313
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:15,788
Johnny, my ring.
- It's save with me.

314
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:18,094
Put it there, dammit.

315
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:39,435
Ms Sheira, do you
even know what's going on here?

316
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:44,779
No, please leave.
- It's time for you to open your eyes.

317
00:38:45,796 --> 00:38:47,348
No. Help.

318
00:38:52,517 --> 00:38:54,977
I'm watching out for you.
- Thanks.

319
00:40:19,089 --> 00:40:23,101
Sexy and not yet 16,
sexy and not yet 16...

320
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:34,122
What are the two lovers up to?

321
00:40:36,273 --> 00:40:40,838
I hope I'm not interrupting
a sexual intimacy.

322
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:53,380
Miss, I am surprised.
How life goes.

323
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,442
I came to this area by chance.

324
00:41:01,695 --> 00:41:07,214
A stroke of fate put me here
to relish your opulent anatomy.

325
00:41:08,353 --> 00:41:10,055
I kiss your hand.

326
00:41:11,797 --> 00:41:14,112
Would you stop?
That's awful.

327
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:18,288
Oh god, the dear husband is offended.

328
00:41:20,076 --> 00:41:22,336
By the sweat of his brow.

329
00:41:23,598 --> 00:41:25,894
May I help you?

330
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:33,392
I suggest you leave,
or I will place my hand in your face.

331
00:41:34,032 --> 00:41:36,392
Leave me alone.
- As you wish.

332
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:39,666
I didn't want to bother you.

333
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:43,551
Come. We have to
talk something over anyway.

334
00:41:45,389 --> 00:41:49,365
You don't mind that I take your girl
for a walk, right?

335
00:41:49,855 --> 00:41:53,622
I'll bring her back in one piece.
- Whatever.

336
00:42:05,543 --> 00:42:08,793
How do you feel after
your success yesterday?

337
00:42:09,474 --> 00:42:11,571
You really were going wild.

338
00:42:12,002 --> 00:42:16,867
I got out of line. How bad was it?
Did Ms Sheira notice anything?

339
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:23,235
If she noticed, she ignored it.
She likes you.

340
00:42:25,277 --> 00:42:30,669
"I decide, who misbehaves", she says
"and the others must follow".

341
00:42:34,273 --> 00:42:36,397
But of course she noticed it.

342
00:42:36,905 --> 00:42:40,527
I feel so embarrassed.
I've never been this drunk before.

343
00:42:41,035 --> 00:42:43,286
You're only getting started.

344
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:49,593
Don't wet your pants.

345
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:54,059
Tomorrow it will be forgotten.
These things happen.

346
00:42:54,646 --> 00:43:01,327
Besides, only Johnny knows that
you went to bed with the wrong guy.

347
00:43:02,357 --> 00:43:04,699
And Johnny keeps it for himself.

348
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:11,652
Johnny even made some money.
You'll get a piece.

349
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,445
Hey! A piece?
I don't understand.

350
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:30,495
When Johnny met the gentleman today
and told him that you're under sixteen,

351
00:43:30,745 --> 00:43:35,878
his response was that small gifts
will best maintain our friendship.

352
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:38,186
I'm all with him.

353
00:43:38,526 --> 00:43:41,857
I didn't want to embarrass him,
so I accepted.

354
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:47,117
Little by little,
the bird builds its nest.

355
00:43:50,571 --> 00:43:52,423
You blackmailed him?

356
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:58,923
You bastard!
I just want to shrivel up and...

357
00:43:59,173 --> 00:44:02,363
...die? Come now!

358
00:44:03,825 --> 00:44:07,446
Chin up, miss. You're still needed.

359
00:44:10,353 --> 00:44:13,684
Jokes aside, I have big plans for you.

360
00:44:15,372 --> 00:44:18,577
If we work together I can
get you in business.

361
00:44:19,543 --> 00:44:25,861
Yesterday's fool was only a test.
We've to tap those moneybags.

362
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,440
In two years we have our own enterprise.

363
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:34,847
With your talents and my
knowledge of the trade it's foolproof.

364
00:44:35,097 --> 00:44:38,746
Shut up! I don't want to
listen to this anymore!

365
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:41,209
Do you actually believe I'll let

366
00:44:41,459 --> 00:44:44,309
a sleazy crook like you
put me under pressure?

367
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:46,945
I rather go into a juvenile shelter.

368
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:49,812
That's what I'll do!
- Stop!

369
00:44:51,297 --> 00:44:54,822
I think you're confusing welfare
with juvenile prison.

370
00:44:55,072 --> 00:44:56,833
That's were you're going.

371
00:44:57,739 --> 00:45:01,850
Judges don't like it when girls hit
on older gentlemen.

372
00:45:02,486 --> 00:45:07,481
That's prostitution.
- No, that's not true!

373
00:45:08,711 --> 00:45:13,778
It's your fault and I can prove it.
- You can't prove a thing, you brat!

374
00:45:14,738 --> 00:45:19,769
I have three witnesses who
can testify against you.

375
00:45:22,776 --> 00:45:25,985
Oh god, what am I supposed to do?

376
00:45:27,234 --> 00:45:30,101
Nothing, leave everything to me.

377
00:45:35,686 --> 00:45:37,562
You understood me, right?

378
00:45:38,454 --> 00:45:40,420
Yes, I think so.

379
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,046
OK then, may I offer you my arm.
- Don't touch me!

380
00:45:51,395 --> 00:45:54,478
Excuse me? What was that?

381
00:45:57,593 --> 00:46:00,857
Because of Rolf... please...

382
00:46:05,042 --> 00:46:06,742
OK, that's more like it.

383
00:46:12,106 --> 00:46:16,722
I'm no monster. We'll get along.

384
00:46:22,133 --> 00:46:22,854
Yes.

385
00:46:35,847 --> 00:46:39,696
Here we are again.
I won't bother you any longer.

386
00:46:42,523 --> 00:46:47,218
Are you coming to the six day race?
- I can't tonight.

387
00:46:48,162 --> 00:46:50,012
Too bad.
- I have to work.

388
00:46:50,262 --> 00:46:54,753
Rosy, you can come if you like.
You know how to reach me.

389
00:46:55,614 --> 00:46:56,497
Bye.

390
00:47:02,872 --> 00:47:04,468
Lets make up.

391
00:47:09,163 --> 00:47:13,166
It's all in the past.
Let's not talk about it anymore.

392
00:47:23,506 --> 00:47:25,372
That's him.
- Where?

393
00:47:40,412 --> 00:47:41,737
Do you know him?

394
00:47:45,221 --> 00:47:48,638
He's an old friend.
Have a drink.

395
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:51,467
Cheers.

396
00:47:52,332 --> 00:47:53,604
That's him.

397
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,386
I really like it here.

398
00:49:29,403 --> 00:49:30,341
Come on.

399
00:49:33,884 --> 00:49:34,912
Come on.

400
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,749
Old buddy, may I introduce you
to a fan of yours.

401
00:49:54,267 --> 00:49:58,153
She bothered me since she found out
that I know you. That's Rosy.

402
00:49:58,523 --> 00:50:01,164
I don't have to introduce him, right?

403
00:50:01,777 --> 00:50:03,603
No.
- It's a pleasure.

404
00:50:05,605 --> 00:50:07,182
That's a surprise.

405
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:09,752
Have a seat.

406
00:50:10,543 --> 00:50:14,447
Can I have an autograph?
- Of course.   - Thanks.

407
00:50:16,783 --> 00:50:20,651
Nice place.
- Only because of Rosy here.

408
00:50:22,572 --> 00:50:24,357
Sadly I have no time.

409
00:50:26,246 --> 00:50:30,884
Where is it... you know...
Still in the same place?

410
00:50:31,227 --> 00:50:36,988
Yes, down the hallway, left,
then the last door left.

411
00:50:37,772 --> 00:50:39,152
It's alright.

412
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,162
Now we're alone.

413
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,364
No!
- Now you get your autograph.

414
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,609
For the love of god.
- I told you I have no time.

415
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,502
No.

416
00:51:00,742 --> 00:51:04,961
Dammit, don't be prudish.
You all want the same anyway.

417
00:51:23,005 --> 00:51:25,638
It'll be over soon.
It's alright.

418
00:52:08,132 --> 00:52:09,295
Hey, Max.

419
00:52:10,341 --> 00:52:15,020
I'm sorry I couldn't visit you yesterday
but the door was locked.

420
00:52:18,267 --> 00:52:20,512
I can imagine.
Was it nice?

421
00:52:22,261 --> 00:52:23,208
So-so?

422
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:25,640
You're crazy.

423
00:52:26,767 --> 00:52:32,731
By the way, about the girl...
she's not yet sixteen.

424
00:52:35,634 --> 00:52:37,284
You don't care?

425
00:52:38,348 --> 00:52:41,990
Maybe her mother cares and
thereby a prosecutor too.

426
00:52:43,085 --> 00:52:44,591
How about that?

427
00:52:45,772 --> 00:52:46,620
See!

428
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:51,479
I knew you're reasonable.

429
00:52:52,946 --> 00:52:54,623
Bye, see you later.

430
00:52:55,669 --> 00:52:58,500
Johnny, what are you doing
in the dark?

431
00:52:59,771 --> 00:53:03,702
Do I have to give account
for every phone call I make?

432
00:53:04,455 --> 00:53:08,494
Can't I have five minutes
without you on my back?

433
00:53:09,035 --> 00:53:12,100
How are you talking to me?
- I talk like I want to.

434
00:53:12,448 --> 00:53:15,486
What are you doing here?
- I was looking for you.

435
00:53:16,081 --> 00:53:18,632
I see, you were looking for me.

436
00:53:20,016 --> 00:53:23,091
What do you want, superstar?

437
00:53:23,911 --> 00:53:26,210
Do you want me to walk your dog?

438
00:53:27,259 --> 00:53:28,539
I just thought...

439
00:53:30,513 --> 00:53:36,112
you spent so much money
on my birthday present.

440
00:53:37,775 --> 00:53:42,301
Do you need money?
- I don't fall for that anymore.

441
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:45,853
Thanks but I don't need your money.

442
00:53:48,838 --> 00:53:50,298
Rosy...
- Rolf...

443
00:53:50,548 --> 00:53:54,238
I thought about the juvenile center.
I want to apologize.

444
00:53:54,932 --> 00:54:02,316
My friend is also staying in a center.
Maybe I could stay there with her.

445
00:54:03,094 --> 00:54:05,312
If my mother agrees...

446
00:54:06,151 --> 00:54:11,335
And I could get a job
in the company she's working.

447
00:54:12,921 --> 00:54:17,699
They are looking for trainees.
Only my mother has to agree.

448
00:54:18,137 --> 00:54:21,229
And my legal guardian has to agree,
my uncle Armin.

449
00:54:21,479 --> 00:54:25,295
I'd have to write him,
but I'm sure he won't say no.

450
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:34,386
If you're not against it...
- I think that's great.

451
00:56:27,184 --> 00:56:30,232
Max, did you get winded?
Did you quit already?

452
00:56:31,994 --> 00:56:34,437
My partner's racing at the moment.

453
00:56:35,204 --> 00:56:37,304
What's up? I'm busy.

454
00:56:39,139 --> 00:56:42,286
What are you smoking?
- A filter cigarette, what else?

455
00:56:44,274 --> 00:56:48,656
Yes, filters but what's inside?
- Why don't you look for yourself?

456
00:57:05,329 --> 00:57:07,827
We should come down to business.

457
00:57:08,464 --> 00:57:11,746
I don't do business with you.
- I think you will.

458
00:57:12,499 --> 00:57:16,493
Newspapers might be interested
in the story of yesterday evening.

459
00:57:17,697 --> 00:57:23,872
And maybe I put some doping-relevant
stuff in this cigarette bud.

460
00:57:27,055 --> 00:57:30,138
But of course,
I'd want us to stay friends...

461
00:57:30,607 --> 00:57:35,978
That's not possible anymore.
- Why? If the money's right...

462
00:57:38,117 --> 00:57:40,975
I'm satisfied with 10% of your
prize money.

463
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,760
You're boring me.
- Think about the girl and the cig.

464
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:49,934
Virginia tobacco - but the girl
was definitely no virgin.

465
00:57:50,184 --> 00:57:52,179
She even said so herself.

466
00:57:52,429 --> 00:57:54,025
She was scared of you,

467
00:57:54,275 --> 00:57:57,548
so I told her about the laws for
procurement and blackmail.

468
00:57:57,798 --> 00:57:59,298
She's quite alright.

469
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:04,269
As for your other dig, I can show
you what it means to get winded.

470
00:58:23,899 --> 00:58:26,459
Your style of clothing is disgusting.

471
00:58:27,377 --> 00:58:30,681
Boss, don't forget about the cufflinks.

472
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:34,468
Alright, one for each.

473
00:58:38,772 --> 00:58:40,422
How do you like it?

474
00:58:49,475 --> 00:58:51,945
Max, you have to do one lap.

475
00:58:53,343 --> 00:58:56,690
Why, dammit?
- Only one lap.

476
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:01,447
It's for the news. You'll be presented
with flowers by some movie chick.

477
00:59:01,845 --> 00:59:06,394
Hopefully no roses.
- Come on, it's only one lap.

478
00:59:07,501 --> 00:59:10,215
Leave something for me.
- Alright boss.

479
01:00:36,888 --> 01:00:37,862
Whoops!

480
01:00:42,099 --> 01:00:43,505
Come on in.

481
01:00:48,315 --> 01:00:51,272
Sit down, you're
making me nervous.

482
01:00:53,589 --> 01:00:56,600
You look just great.

483
01:01:00,001 --> 01:01:01,100
Stop it.

484
01:01:02,209 --> 01:01:04,328
I'm just getting started.

485
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:08,085
Can't you be nice just for once?

486
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:12,471
I had a car accident...
- Stop.

487
01:01:14,013 --> 01:01:17,105
If I laugh I'll mess up
my makeup.

488
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:21,803
I can explain everything.
- Wait til I'm done with the left side.

489
01:01:25,625 --> 01:01:27,203
Alright, go ahead.

490
01:01:27,997 --> 01:01:30,131
You look just great.

491
01:01:30,861 --> 01:01:33,566
Had I no humor I would laugh.

492
01:01:34,256 --> 01:01:35,390
Tucholsky.

493
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:40,817
"So test therefore, who join forever"
or who has to be patched up.

494
01:01:41,777 --> 01:01:44,843
You look just great.
- You already said that.

495
01:01:45,221 --> 01:01:48,059
Twice.
- Say it three times...

496
01:01:49,402 --> 01:01:52,783
It was Rolf's fist, huh?

497
01:01:53,325 --> 01:01:58,194
He beat the daylights out of you.
The guy starts to grow on me.

498
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:01,440
What makes you think that
it was Rolf?

499
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:06,905
Who else? Rosy is in love with him.

500
01:02:07,734 --> 01:02:11,286
Hands off! I thought
you didn't need my money?

501
01:02:13,806 --> 01:02:16,403
Go, I'm sick of your sight.

502
01:02:17,332 --> 01:02:18,981
Get out!

503
01:02:23,899 --> 01:02:25,107
That bastard.

504
01:02:31,368 --> 01:02:33,363
Who did you fool around with?

505
01:02:33,613 --> 01:02:36,147
Telephone.
- Did you get in trouble?

506
01:02:38,924 --> 01:02:41,521
Get out of here!
- What?

507
01:02:42,693 --> 01:02:47,291
A babycham on the rocks for the lady
so her makeup stays crisp.

508
01:02:47,701 --> 01:02:50,045
You're mean.
- Get a move on!

509
01:02:50,379 --> 01:02:52,056
I'm going, I'm going...

510
01:02:59,631 --> 01:03:01,768
Hello. It's me.

511
01:03:02,649 --> 01:03:05,787
Change of plans. We'll meet
at the freight yard.

512
01:03:06,037 --> 01:03:08,104
Why? Leave it to me.

513
01:03:09,271 --> 01:03:11,451
On the contrary, anything goes.

514
01:03:12,136 --> 01:03:16,355
Give him hell so his own mother
won't be able to recognize him.

515
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:22,238
Stay in hiding til I'm
there with the girl.

516
01:03:23,005 --> 01:03:24,492
OK, see you.

517
01:03:29,198 --> 01:03:33,778
Sorry to bother you but I have to
tell you something important.

518
01:03:34,612 --> 01:03:38,733
I think I know what it's about.
Come in and close the door.

519
01:03:41,861 --> 01:03:43,547
Have a seat.

520
01:03:47,654 --> 01:03:50,638
Is it about Johnny?
- You talk too much.

521
01:03:51,197 --> 01:03:54,343
You told Rolf everything.
- Yes, I have told him.

522
01:03:55,304 --> 01:03:58,712
I'm not afraid of you.
I'll move in a juvenile center.

523
01:03:59,352 --> 01:04:04,874
Rolf and I have an agreement.
- So you kids have an agreement, huh?

524
01:04:06,745 --> 01:04:08,917
Come along now!
- No way!

525
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:11,379
Listen up...

526
01:04:12,204 --> 01:04:15,657
Friends of mine are
beating up Rolf right now.

527
01:04:15,907 --> 01:04:18,307
And they won't stop til I tell 'em to.

528
01:04:19,051 --> 01:04:22,667
If you don't come along
I won't tell them to stop.

529
01:04:23,861 --> 01:04:25,322
Get a move on!

530
01:04:27,089 --> 01:04:28,567
There we go.

531
01:04:30,447 --> 01:04:33,449
My god, we have to do something.

532
01:04:34,142 --> 01:04:37,234
Don't worry, Ms Sheira.

533
01:04:39,533 --> 01:04:41,111
Leave it all to me.

534
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:45,454
I have connections to the police.

535
01:04:45,864 --> 01:04:49,407
What connections? Call them now!

536
01:04:49,657 --> 01:04:52,542
The riot squad, now!
You goof!

537
01:04:57,283 --> 01:04:59,411
Hey, you son of a bitch!

538
01:05:01,007 --> 01:05:01,854
Huh?

539
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:05,792
There she is, your chick.
She isn't picky. She does it

540
01:05:06,042 --> 01:05:09,209
with everyone, including me!
- That's not true!

541
01:05:23,075 --> 01:05:26,366
With me, right in front of your eyes.

542
01:06:45,926 --> 01:06:47,476
Run away.
- Rolf!

543
01:06:56,916 --> 01:06:57,916
Rolf!

544
01:07:00,955 --> 01:07:01,937
Rolf!

545
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:15,440
<i>Sexy and not yet 16.
Sexy and not yet 16.</i>

546
01:08:16,247 --> 01:08:21,783
<i>One has to,
one should, by god, understand...</i>

547
01:08:22,943 --> 01:08:27,333
<i>Sexy and not yet 16.
Sexy and not yet 16.</i>

548
01:08:28,122 --> 01:08:31,675
<i>Everyone sees her once...
everyone wants to, once...</i>

549
01:08:31,925 --> 01:08:34,668
<i>but she won't even understand.</i>

550
01:08:47,058 --> 01:08:51,737
<i>Sexy and not yet 16.
Sexy and not yet 16.</i>

551
01:08:52,575 --> 01:08:56,281
<i>Everyone sees her once...
everyone wants to, once...</i>

552
01:08:56,531 --> 01:08:58,756
<i>but she won't even understand.</i>

553
01:09:08,842 --> 01:09:10,654
THE END
