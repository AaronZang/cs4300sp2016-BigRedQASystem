Previously on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,116
Let's delve into your childhood.

3
00:00:03,141 --> 00:00:04,570
Oh, I was afraid you'd say that.

4
00:00:04,595 --> 00:00:06,906
- I used to like her.
- You still do.

5
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:08,598
I don't want to be your back-up plan.

6
00:00:08,623 --> 00:00:10,579
I am bi-sexual!

7
00:00:10,581 --> 00:00:13,048
I'm going for drinks with this gay man

8
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,070
whom I have a crush on.

9
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:16,070
This could be the biggest
case the county's ever seen.

10
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:18,995
I must find in favor of the
defendants... Greater City Water.

11
00:00:18,997 --> 00:00:20,497
I'm from the metro desk at the paper.

00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:21,631
This should help get you started.

13
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:22,632
These are e-mails that clearly

14
00:00:22,634 --> 00:00:23,667
expose a cover-up.

15
00:00:23,669 --> 00:00:25,402
You tried really hard today.

16
00:00:25,404 --> 00:00:27,103
I wanted you to be proud of me.

17
00:00:27,105 --> 00:00:29,873
I didn't know you thought

00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:38,842
What happened?

39
00:01:44,516 --> 00:01:47,217
Dude, bro, what happened?

40
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:49,953
God, it was such a magical kiss.

41
00:01:49,955 --> 00:01:52,299
Oh, my gosh, it transported
me to a different world,

42
00:01:53,304 --> 00:01:55,725
Like where they shoot the
fun parts of Game of Thrones.

43
00:01:55,727 --> 00:01:57,894
Okay, so, so why are you at
my house? I mean, I watched it

44
00:01:57,896 --> 00:01:59,229
happen, and I took off, 'cause I figured

45
00:01:59,231 --> 00:02:01,064
you two would be having
stand-up sex in the shower

46
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:02,465
of a very nice
bed-and-breakfast by now.

47
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:03,833
I don't... I don't know.

48
00:02:03,835 --> 00:02:06,484
Uh, he just bailed. He
said he had to go somewhere.

49
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:08,705
I don't know where he
is or what he's thinking.

50
00:02:08,707 --> 00:02:09,839
After the kiss, I just bailed.

51
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,474
I'm riddled with guilt.

52
00:02:11,476 --> 00:02:12,709
It's killing me!

53
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:14,978
I'm in a committed relationship, FB.

54
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,846
I live with Valencia.

55
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,515
What do I do?

56
00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:21,284
Bro, do you remember,
in the second grade,

57
00:02:21,286 --> 00:02:23,382
when we had that class bunny, Carrots?

58
00:02:23,968 --> 00:02:25,507
Um... yeah?

59
00:02:26,156 --> 00:02:29,059
Okay, yeah, well, when it was
my week to take care of her,

60
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:31,995
I, um... I accidentally
dropped her in the toilet.

61
00:02:31,997 --> 00:02:34,564
And, uh, I freaked out
so much that I panicked,

62
00:02:35,148 --> 00:02:37,062
and then, I flushed.

63
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:39,096
But, uh, you know,

64
00:02:39,164 --> 00:02:40,656
her baby bunny body...

65
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,630
just clogged that toilet up.

66
00:02:42,726 --> 00:02:44,207
Um, and then, here comes my dad

67
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:46,276
with the plunger, and
then up comes the corpse.

68
00:02:46,278 --> 00:02:47,777
So, I told everybody

69
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:48,878
that my brother Eric did it.

70
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,380
He was only four years old, you know,

71
00:02:50,382 --> 00:02:51,815
so, like, everybody believed me.

72
00:02:51,817 --> 00:02:53,312
It was so easy. It...

73
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,985
It was the perfect crime.

74
00:02:55,195 --> 00:02:56,386
Yeah.

75
00:02:56,388 --> 00:02:59,155
I blamed my baby brother
for that baby bunny body.

76
00:03:03,554 --> 00:03:05,962
Dude, are you stoned right now?

77
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,366
Yeah.

78
00:03:09,368 --> 00:03:10,718
Oh, bro...

79
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,902
I got a bad back. It's awesome.

80
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:14,638
Listen, Josh, would you
just focus for a second?

81
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,707
I was consumed by
guilt for years because

82
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:20,176
that was the first step in
my baby brother becoming,

83
00:03:20,178 --> 00:03:22,078
like, a hardcore
heroin addict, you know?

84
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
And then one day, I realized

85
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:26,406
I had to ask for forgiveness.

86
00:03:27,753 --> 00:03:29,218
And that was hard...

87
00:03:29,821 --> 00:03:32,671
because that cult was on an island.

88
00:03:33,258 --> 00:03:36,031
But I did it, I found
him, and I confessed,

89
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,257
and much like the Madonna...

90
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,464
He forgave me.

91
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:43,929
And that's why I'm a priest, man.

92
00:03:45,604 --> 00:03:49,339
Go to the person you have
wronged, my son, my brah.

93
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,000
Perhaps they will forgive.

94
00:03:53,687 --> 00:03:55,712
Dude, we're talking about Valencia.

95
00:03:55,714 --> 00:03:58,125
Mm... Yeah, you're screwed.

96
00:03:58,678 --> 00:03:59,765
Sorry.

97
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:05,288
We have to celebrate. Your first kiss!

98
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,856
I think I have...

99
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:10,179
sparkling apple cider somewh... aha!

100
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,662
Expires... 2012.

101
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,598
Perfect. Should be alcohol by now.

102
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,500
This...

103
00:04:17,812 --> 00:04:19,903
is my favorite part
of a romantic comedy.

104
00:04:19,905 --> 00:04:24,574
It's like you're Kate Hudson,
and Josh is this British actor

105
00:04:24,576 --> 00:04:27,577
that, like, no one's ever
heard of, but is super cute,

106
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:30,346
and Valencia is the skinny bitch

107
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:32,449
who ends up getting
just what she deserves.

108
00:04:32,451 --> 00:04:34,651
I kind of saw it as fairy tale

109
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:36,019
where I'm the spunky princess,

110
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:38,588
Josh is the handsome prince
who gets turned into a stone,

111
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,591
and Valencia is the witch who
turned him into that stone.

112
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:43,132
You have put a lot of thought
into this narrative.

113
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:44,161
I have.

114
00:04:44,162 --> 00:04:46,904
Hmm. Oh!

115
00:04:46,929 --> 00:04:48,364
Crap. Hold on.

116
00:04:49,617 --> 00:04:51,334
Hi, Dr. Akopian.

117
00:04:51,921 --> 00:04:53,903
Okay, yes, I'm aware we
have an appointment tonight,

118
00:04:53,905 --> 00:04:55,843
and I have to cancel.

119
00:04:56,468 --> 00:04:58,174
I know there's a cancellation fee.

120
00:04:58,176 --> 00:05:00,176
I will pay it, I will reschedule.

121
00:05:00,178 --> 00:05:01,976
I'm so sorry. Bye. Have a good night.

122
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,713
Ew. I feel bad.

123
00:05:03,715 --> 00:05:05,215
I keep canceling with my shrink.

124
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:06,683
I just don't have any time.

125
00:05:06,685 --> 00:05:08,384
God knows why you have a
shrink in the first place

126
00:05:08,386 --> 00:05:10,420
when you have me. I
give such great advice.

127
00:05:10,422 --> 00:05:12,622
Now let's drink this
old expired apple juice.

128
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:16,559
Paula, it's weird; I haven't heard

129
00:05:16,561 --> 00:05:17,894
anything from Josh.

130
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:19,028
Maybe I'll call him just once,

131
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,363
or, like, send him, like, a flirty text.

132
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:23,333
No. No. Oh, God, God, no.

133
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:25,268
Have you never seen a
two-and-half star movie?

134
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,789
Right now, he has to come to you.

135
00:05:27,814 --> 00:05:30,006
The most important thing
is that you don't call,

136
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:34,010
you don't e-mail, you
don't reach out in any way.

137
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:35,414
Okay, fine.

138
00:05:35,814 --> 00:05:39,516
- I have a lot of work to do anyway.
- Good. Cheers.

139
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:44,454
“Client agrees to keep the land

140
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:46,460

141
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:47,703
"Client agre..." Bored!

142
00:05:48,193 --> 00:05:49,425
Oh, boy.

143
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:50,860
This is a dilemma.

144
00:05:50,862 --> 00:05:53,163
Josh loves red pandas
so much, and this one...

145
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:55,532
I mean, if I don't send
it, it's almost mean.

146
00:05:55,534 --> 00:05:56,866
You know, I think even

147
00:05:56,868 --> 00:05:58,501
Paula would understand. I
have to send this to him.

148
00:05:58,503 --> 00:06:00,336
Oh, what am I talking
about? I shouldn't.

149
00:06:00,571 --> 00:06:01,670
He's probably already seen it!

150
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,553
Because everyone knows
he likes red pandas.

151
00:06:03,578 --> 00:06:06,414
You know, and he's probably
gotten this photo a lot.

152
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:08,244
Aah! What if he hasn't?

153
00:06:08,246 --> 00:06:10,084
Oh, and it's the cutest one.

154
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:12,182
Then I'm the jerk. Then it's on me.

155
00:06:12,184 --> 00:06:14,284
Maybe I'll print it out
and mail it anonymously?

156
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:15,652
I gotta stop. I gotta stop.

157
00:06:15,654 --> 00:06:16,773
I have to think about
something besides...

158
00:06:16,798 --> 00:06:18,198
Rebecca?

159
00:06:18,223 --> 00:06:19,455
It's Josh!

160
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:22,992
Oh, my God, it worked.

161
00:06:22,994 --> 00:06:24,460
I'm coming! I'm coming!

162
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:25,728
Yup!

163
00:06:29,276 --> 00:06:30,975
Do you have a minute?

164
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:38,942
I feel overdressed.

165
00:06:41,992 --> 00:06:43,847
Those pajamas are cute.

166
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:46,374
I like the little... sushi on 'em.

167
00:06:46,398 --> 00:06:47,563
Oh.

168
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:50,032
Arigato.

169
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,267
Oh.

170
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:53,669
It's...

171
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:57,304
Oh... So, look, uh, we have
to talk about that kiss.

172
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:59,148
Yes, yes. Yes, we do.

173
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:01,421
I...

174
00:07:01,446 --> 00:07:03,375
Yes. I...

175
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,382
... can't stop thinking about it.

176
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:08,382
- Me, neither.
- I mean, it was...

177
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:10,734
Yeah, no. It-it was.

178
00:07:10,822 --> 00:07:13,312
Rebecca, I feel something for you.

179
00:07:13,337 --> 00:07:15,875
Oh, my God, yes, yes. Wow.

180
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,179
We obviously have some
kind of connection.

181
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,771
No, we absolutely have a
connection, Josh, and I feel...

182
00:07:20,796 --> 00:07:22,320
Aah! I feel so many things.

183
00:07:22,345 --> 00:07:24,278
But kissing you was wrong.

184
00:07:25,603 --> 00:07:26,640
Sorry. What?

185
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:29,433
I have a girlfriend,
you have a boyfriend.

186
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:32,257
Who? Oh, uh, no.

187
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:34,454
No, no, no, no, no. We-we broke up.

188
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,945
Wait. Trent? Tonight? Because of me?

189
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,526
No. He's tall. He... It
doesn't matter. He's dead.

190
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:40,742
Just don't think about
him. Keep talking.

191
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:42,900
But I-I shouldn't have cheated. I...

192
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:45,225
Now there's only one thing to do.

193
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:47,593
Follow your heart... ?

194
00:07:47,618 --> 00:07:49,171
I have to tell Valencia.

195
00:07:49,227 --> 00:07:51,562
And if I tell her, she's definitely

196
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,990
gonna break up with
me, like, definitely.

197
00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:56,148
She will?

198
00:07:56,568 --> 00:08:00,898
Our kiss will end
everything between me and V.

199
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:04,781
Well, uh, that's, uh...

200
00:08:04,806 --> 00:08:06,580
You know, that's terribly sad.

201
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,062
Telling her is the right thing to do.

202
00:08:10,082 --> 00:08:13,031
Even if it means
ending the relationship.

203
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:15,155
Wow.

204
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,203
So, uh, so then...
so then, what happens?

205
00:08:19,452 --> 00:08:21,052
Oh, well, then I go to Hawaii.

206
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:22,914
What?

207
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:25,796
Hector's in a surf competition, and
some of us are coming along.

208
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,003
Oh, thank God.

209
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:30,600
The drama happens, then I get to just

210
00:08:30,602 --> 00:08:34,470
get away for a while, hop on
flight 425 to Maui on Thursday.

211
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,281
Then I'll be in Hawaii just

212
00:08:36,306 --> 00:08:39,718
watching the sunset,
wondering about the future.

213
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,812
Right, um...

214
00:08:42,192 --> 00:08:43,812
your future.

215
00:08:44,936 --> 00:08:47,937
I'm sorry, Rebecca.

216
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:51,463
I, I-I shouldn't have
done what I did, any of it.

217
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:53,863
I shouldn't have... grabbed you,

218
00:08:53,888 --> 00:08:56,055
or squeezed you, or...

219
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,597
put my hand on the nape of your neck,

220
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:01,764
or run it through your hair.

221
00:09:02,195 --> 00:09:04,577
What else? What else did you do?

222
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,679
I-I have to go.

223
00:09:15,853 --> 00:09:17,242
What happens next?

224
00:09:18,177 --> 00:09:20,148
What happens next in-in
your stupid movies?

225
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:22,865
Uh, I think it's obvious.

226
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:26,025
You go bikini shopping
and try on floppy hats.

227
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:27,609
Why?

228
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,992
Because you're going
to Hawaii, you idiot!

229
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:32,284
Ladies, hey, you two chatty Cathys.

230
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:33,861
It's time for the staff meeting.

231
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:35,252
Okay, hold on, Darryl. Darryl...

232
00:09:35,277 --> 00:09:37,710
God. Rebecca, listen,

233
00:09:37,804 --> 00:09:39,664
you are at the grand gesture moment.

234
00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:41,460
It is the best part of any Rom com.

235
00:09:41,485 --> 00:09:42,751
Okay, it's the... it's the...

236
00:09:42,776 --> 00:09:44,543
get up on stage and sing the song,

237
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:45,867
and-and run through the rain

238
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:47,325
and show up and object at the wedding,

239
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,983
and-and... and race to the airport

240
00:09:49,008 --> 00:09:50,203
before he leaves for Kazakhstan.

241
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:51,499
Wait. No, he's going to Hawaii.

242
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:53,434
Rebecca, go to your office,

243
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:56,070
get a ticket on that flight right now.

244
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,207
I don't know... are you
sure this is a good idea?

245
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:00,541
Yes, I know these things.

246
00:10:00,543 --> 00:10:03,778
I am your funny best friend
with all the answers, okay?

247
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,481
I'm your Judy Greer, your
Rosie O'Donnell, your-your...

248
00:10:06,483 --> 00:10:08,950
- your Joan Cusack.
- You know what?

249
00:10:08,952 --> 00:10:10,551
In my narrative, I'd picture you

250
00:10:10,553 --> 00:10:11,919
as, like, the funny singing raccoon.

251
00:10:11,921 --> 00:10:13,721
- Of course you did.
- That's not an insult.

252
00:10:13,723 --> 00:10:15,290
You have the breakout
song of the whole movie.

253
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:16,257
Just go get the ticket!

254
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:17,757
Okay, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it!

255
00:10:18,804 --> 00:10:20,728
You know what? As the kids say,

256
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,530
I'm gonna YOLO before I FOMO.

257
00:10:22,532 --> 00:10:25,133
- Is that yogurt? What is that?
- I saw it on a meme.

258
00:10:25,135 --> 00:10:26,100
I have no idea what that...

259
00:10:26,102 --> 00:10:28,269
Nor do I care. Go get the ticket.

260
00:10:39,586 --> 00:10:40,618
Hi, honey.

261
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,053
Nothing's wrong. What?

262
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:43,955
You've been
acting all weird today.

263
00:10:43,957 --> 00:10:44,989
What's wrong?

264
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:47,171
I-I-I
don't know

265
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:48,539
what you're talking about.

266
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,128
You already worked out this morning,

267
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,130
and now you're going to the gym again?

268
00:10:52,132 --> 00:10:54,632
A man can't go to
CrossFit for six hours?

269
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:55,933
Big things are happening there.

270
00:10:55,935 --> 00:10:57,235
We're doing the Murph today.

271
00:10:57,237 --> 00:10:58,936
Okay.

272
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:03,953
Actually, um,

273
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:06,344
there is something I wanted

274
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:08,109
to talk to you about. Maybe we should...

275
00:11:08,248 --> 00:11:09,937
talk after your evening class.

276
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:11,462
Oh, honey, I'm gonna be late tonight.

277
00:11:11,594 --> 00:11:13,193
I'm doing that cryotherapy thing.

278
00:11:13,195 --> 00:11:14,561
We'll talk about it tomorrow, then.

279
00:11:14,563 --> 00:11:15,596
That's even better. Good!

280
00:11:15,598 --> 00:11:16,530
That's even better. Good!

281
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:18,499
No kiss?

282
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:19,967
Hmm.

283
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:22,403
I wonder what's going on.

284
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:27,951
Okay, people...

285
00:11:28,507 --> 00:11:29,777
no beating around the bush.

286
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:31,945
Let's get to why we're here.

287
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:34,014
Um, hi, everyone.

288
00:11:34,016 --> 00:11:36,350
Uh, since this is my
first staff meeting,

289
00:11:36,352 --> 00:11:38,519
I thought I'd give
everybody a big hello.

290
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:39,820
My name is Maya.

291
00:11:39,822 --> 00:11:42,156
I'm the new administrative assistant.

292
00:11:42,158 --> 00:11:43,724
And a little about me...

293
00:11:43,726 --> 00:11:46,760
Um, I love online shopping
and kale salads and...

294
00:11:46,762 --> 00:11:48,982
Maya, this is not the time.

295
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:50,064
This is not about you.

296
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:51,098
Okay?

297
00:11:51,318 --> 00:11:52,350
Please.

298
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:54,093
Is everybody on board? Great.

299
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:56,370
I want you all to
listen really hard now.

300
00:11:56,372 --> 00:11:57,638
I mean, really listen.

301
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,705
Like, with both your ears.

302
00:11:58,707 --> 00:12:00,140
Okay, Darryl, spit it out.

303
00:12:00,142 --> 00:12:01,442
Okay, well I'm sure you've noticed

304
00:12:01,444 --> 00:12:03,287
that I've been going
through a lot lately.

305
00:12:03,312 --> 00:12:04,881
And I know you've often wondered:

306
00:12:04,906 --> 00:12:06,980
“Who is Daryl, really?”

307
00:12:06,982 --> 00:12:07,781
Nope, never.

308
00:12:07,783 --> 00:12:08,782
Darryl, until February,

309
00:12:08,784 --> 00:12:10,184
I thought your name was Jasper.

310
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:15,389
Okay, pre-purchase Wi-Fi
to save seven dollars, yes.

311
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:17,739
Dietary restrictions.

312
00:12:17,764 --> 00:12:19,031
You betcha.

313
00:12:25,343 --> 00:12:26,333
You know,

314
00:12:26,335 --> 00:12:28,635
there are times when I
look out these windows,

315
00:12:28,637 --> 00:12:29,837
and I know you're all thinking,

316
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,872
“What makes the
measure of this man?”

317
00:12:31,874 --> 00:12:33,974
Oh, my God, you'd better be dying!

318
00:12:33,976 --> 00:12:37,084
Look, I called you all here

319
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:38,612
to tell you,

320
00:12:38,614 --> 00:12:40,390
with pride and excitement...

321
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,150
and a lot of pride,

322
00:12:43,152 --> 00:12:46,873
about the new and improved
Darryl C. Whitefeather.

323
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:48,322
Jim, give me a beat.

324
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:50,157
Sorry, what?

325
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,992
When somebody asks for a
beat you just, you don't ask

326
00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:53,560
a lot of questions.
You just get down on it.

327
00:12:53,562 --> 00:12:56,029
Oh, you want, like, a syncopated
thing or, like, a vibey thing?

328
00:12:56,031 --> 00:12:57,831

Any questions?

385
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,146
Oh, come on. You guys aren't weirded out

386
00:15:26,148 --> 00:15:27,681
because I'm bisexual, are you?

387
00:15:27,683 --> 00:15:29,850
No, we're weirded out
by the fact that our boss

388
00:15:29,852 --> 00:15:31,551
just called a meeting to tell us that.

389
00:15:31,553 --> 00:15:32,352
Um...

390
00:15:32,354 --> 00:15:34,021
Hi, everyone, again.

391
00:15:34,023 --> 00:15:35,489
I know that this is

392
00:15:35,491 --> 00:15:37,424
a little personal for
my first week here,

393
00:15:37,426 --> 00:15:39,359
but I'm also bisexual,

394
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:42,462
and I am so glad that
this office is so open...

395
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:43,797
Does anyone else have
any other questions

396
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,799
besides Maya, who seems
to think that every meeting

397
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:47,801
is about her for some reason?

398
00:15:48,604 --> 00:15:49,481
Jim.

399
00:15:49,738 --> 00:15:50,871
Are you sure you're not just gay?

400
00:15:50,873 --> 00:15:51,972
Oh, my God.

401
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:53,340
Did you not hear what I said?

402
00:15:53,342 --> 00:15:54,708
Come on!

403
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,977
Guys, this is important.

404
00:15:56,979 --> 00:15:58,312
Are there any other questions?

405
00:15:58,314 --> 00:15:59,313
Whoa.

406
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:00,347
This is weird.

407
00:16:00,349 --> 00:16:01,559
Hey, guys, look at this.

408
00:16:03,543 --> 00:16:04,718
I don't believe it.

409
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,253
Bunch is some kind of hero.

410
00:16:06,255 --> 00:16:07,888
Oh, my God!

411
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,089
This is perfect.

412
00:16:09,091 --> 00:16:12,492
Now she can lip-sync on a parade float!

413
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,054
So, we're moving on from my stuff, then.

414
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:16,861
Cool.

415
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,506
Wow, you are really
having the best day ever!

416
00:16:26,508 --> 00:16:28,141
You know that evidence
you gave to the reporter?

417
00:16:28,143 --> 00:16:29,309
It's touched off a landslide.

418
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:30,777
Have you seen this?

419
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:36,249
What's wrong?

420
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:37,551
Um, okay, uh, what's wrong

421
00:16:37,553 --> 00:16:39,353
is I was trying to buy
the ticket for Hawaii,

422
00:16:39,355 --> 00:16:40,520
and so I tried

423
00:16:40,522 --> 00:16:41,588
all of my credit cards,

424
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,689
and then I tried my debit card,

425
00:16:42,691 --> 00:16:43,757
and then I checked my bank account...

426
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,158
Which according to the welcome screen,

427
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,728
I haven't done since
2011... And now I'm seeing

428
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,430
my balance, and, Paula,
guess what's in there. Guess.

429
00:16:50,432 --> 00:16:52,199
It's a negative number,
Paula. It's negative a lot.

430
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:54,801
Holy Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Paula.

431
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:56,278
Am I broke?

432
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:05,941
How could you be broke?

433
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:06,996
You're rich.

434
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:08,054
That's what I thought.

435
00:17:08,212 --> 00:17:09,590
Yo, Bunch.

436
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,527
Guy from the Mayor's
Office is here for you.

437
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:12,729
It's the mayor.

438
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,731
He wants to give you the
key to the city or something.

439
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:15,932
Uh, yeah, okay.

440
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,133
I'll be right there.

441
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:18,020
Okay.

442
00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:20,203
I don't understand this.

443
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,971
How am I broke? I can't be broke.

444
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:23,439
I mean, all right,
sure, since I moved here,

445
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:25,341
maybe I've spent a little
money here and there.

446
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:26,576
So I got this treadmill desk.

447
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,745
That was, like, $2,000 mistake?

448
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,046
I pledge $1,000.

449
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:31,447
And it's really fine.

450
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:33,983
- I-I-I got it.
- Good thing the drinks are free.

451
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:35,832
Here you go.

452
00:17:36,192 --> 00:17:38,221
I'm gonna go to the
bank, withdraw $10,000

453
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,224
and plant it in your wife's suitcase.

454
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,227
Well, you had a huge salary in New York.

455
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,828
What about your savings?

456
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,331
I never worried about saving.

457
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,600
You know what, I keep
forgetting that you are so smart

458
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,401
and so not smart!

459
00:17:52,403 --> 00:17:53,870
I just never had to think about money.

460
00:17:54,098 --> 00:17:55,404
You don't think about money.

461
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:57,573
Wow, that must free up some time.

462
00:17:57,575 --> 00:17:58,629
Paula?

463
00:17:58,843 --> 00:18:01,129
I can't go. There's no
running to Kazakhstan.

464
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,246
- Hawaii is out.
- What?

465
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,782
No. Okay, Rebecca, let me
explain something to you.

466
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,948
You have a window,

467
00:18:07,973 --> 00:18:10,319
and that window is Hawaii!

468
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:12,021
I can't afford to go
to Hawaii right now.

469
00:18:12,023 --> 00:18:13,923
I can't even afford to
buy a pack of Skittles!

470
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:15,358
Okay, look, I would give you the money,

471
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,492
but I don't have any money.

472
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:17,493
Rebecca.

473
00:18:17,495 --> 00:18:18,594
The mayor doesn't have all day.

474
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:20,196
Or maybe he does.
Yeah, he probably does.

475
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:21,285
But he's out here.

476
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:26,917
Here she is right now.

477
00:18:26,942 --> 00:18:28,541
Rebecca.

478
00:18:28,723 --> 00:18:31,541
You are an inspiration, a model citizen,

479
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,810
and we would be thrilled to
give you the key to the city.

480
00:18:34,403 --> 00:18:36,189
Oh, wow.

481
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:38,548
That, what, that's great.

482
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,692
Key to the city.

483
00:18:39,895 --> 00:18:42,051
Uh, question, is there a cash prize

484
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:43,686
associated with that?

485
00:18:44,153 --> 00:18:45,188
No.

486
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,556
Sorry, okay.

487
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,481
I don't know how things work.

488
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:51,460
She's looking sharp in that suit.

489
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:54,664
It really highlights her brains
and tactical thinking skills.

490
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,199
Is she still single?

491
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,300
Who cares? Who knows?

492
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,629
I don't even think about that anymore.

493
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,237
Why not? Didn't you go all the way to LA

494
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:02,438
just to tell her you dig her?

495
00:19:02,848 --> 00:19:04,145
Yes, I did, Chris.

496
00:19:04,301 --> 00:19:06,309
And it did not work out.

497
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:09,178
'Cause life isn't a
two-and-a-half-star movie.

498
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,680
I made a grand gesture,

499
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,148
I made a fool out of myself,

500
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,484
cause that's what happens when
you emulate stupid rom-coms.

501
00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:17,854
So you and Heather
split up for no reason?

502
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:19,121
Ouch.

503
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:21,075
And now you have to work together?

504
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,892
I might take my root beer to go.

505
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:25,012
It's gonna be a bloodbath
when she shows up.

506
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:26,529
What? No.

507
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:27,797
There's not gonna be any drama.

508
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,365
She broke up with me.

509
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:31,300
Besides, Heather is chill,

510
00:19:31,302 --> 00:19:32,668
mature, tattooed.

511
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,136
She's gonna be totally cool about it.

512
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:35,684
Hit the deck.

513
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:38,121
Hey, dude.

514
00:19:39,132 --> 00:19:40,464
'Sup, girl?

515
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,111
See?

516
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:44,914
That's how two adults
handle the post-breakup.

517
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,916
Watch and learn.

518
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:50,043
Okay, Mom.

519
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:51,634
Love you. Bye.

520
00:19:51,988 --> 00:19:53,535
What was that?

521
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:55,848
I don't know if she's
having a stroke or something,

522
00:19:55,873 --> 00:19:59,175
but... she said she saw the
articles about me online,

523
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,815
and she loves me.

524
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:02,899
And she's proud of me.

525
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,967
- Oh!
- And she's sending me a present.

526
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:06,035
Yay.

527
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:07,203
I mean, it's probably rugelach.

528
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:08,337
Gesundheit.

529
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:09,739
- Come on, you know what rugelach is.
- Nope.

530
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,374
- What?
- No, what is it?

531
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,009
It's amazing. It's, like, a dessert.

532
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,143
- Oh, all right.
- Anyway,

533
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:15,878
I mean, she's not gonna be proud of me

534
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,146
now that I'm a pauper.

535
00:20:17,148 --> 00:20:18,981
Okay, you're gonna get a
paycheck next week, right?

536
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:21,017
I get a paycheck next
week? Wait, for how much?

537
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,752
You don't know how much you earn?!

538
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:23,986
I'm a lawyer, not an accountant.

539
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:25,087
- Oh...
- Everyone.

540
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:26,122
There's a car

541
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,490
right outside the office,

542
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:28,791
and it's being repossessed.

543
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:30,059
They're towing it right now.

544
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:31,694
Does anyone here own

545
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:33,996
a 2015 Hyundai Sonata?

546
00:20:33,998 --> 00:20:34,797
No!

547
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,798
Oh, my God!

548
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,899
Oh, my God, I can't watch.

549
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:38,200
I can't watch. I can't watch.

550
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:39,602
My poor little Hyundai.

551
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:41,871
Oh, my gosh, with its roomy
interior and sporty feel.

552
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:42,905
Did you pay your lease?

553
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:44,707
I mean, my lease is
set to auto-pay, but...

554
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:45,841
You didn't pay your lease.

555
00:20:45,843 --> 00:20:47,076
You know what, unless
you have a time machine,

556
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:48,177
comments like that
aren't helpful right now.

557
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:48,934
What do I do?

558
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:50,313
Uh, maybe I can sell the car.

559
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:52,481
Wait.

560
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:54,628
What? Do I not own my car?

561
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:55,985
Do I not own my car anymore?

562
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:57,153
Paula?

563
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,821
Paula?

564
00:20:58,823 --> 00:21:01,114
Paula? Paula?

565
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:05,769
Miss? Miss?

566
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:07,404
Miss, can you help me?

567
00:21:07,406 --> 00:21:09,340
I ordered a vodka a while ago.

568
00:21:09,342 --> 00:21:11,041
Okay, well, you made me lose count,

569
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:13,496
so now I have to start over. Thanks.

570
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:15,112
Uh, I'll count them for you.

571
00:21:15,114 --> 00:21:16,747
Just make me a drink?

572
00:21:16,749 --> 00:21:17,934
Hey.

573
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:19,116
How's it going over here?

574
00:21:19,118 --> 00:21:20,885
I'm just touching all the cherries.

575
00:21:20,887 --> 00:21:22,219
They feel like eyeballs.

576
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:23,521
It's so slow here today.

577
00:21:23,523 --> 00:21:25,371
I have, like, nothing to do.

578
00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:27,525
This is nice.

579
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:30,060
Us being cool,
working side-by-side.

580
00:21:30,062 --> 00:21:31,418
Yep.

581
00:21:31,443 --> 00:21:33,797
A lot of people would think
this would be awkward between us

582
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:34,746
because we used to...

583
00:21:37,603 --> 00:21:39,036
You know what we used too.

584
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:40,504
But it's totally fine.

585
00:21:40,606 --> 00:21:41,809
Oh, yeah.

586
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:44,975
Besides, it's not like we
were, like, serious or anything.

587
00:21:44,977 --> 00:21:46,243
We were just having fun, right?

588
00:21:46,245 --> 00:21:47,231
Yeah.

589
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:48,797
Yeah.

590
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,581
So what happened with you and Rebecca?

591
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,650
Oh, it's...

592
00:21:52,652 --> 00:21:54,348
Didn't work out, but...

593
00:21:55,684 --> 00:21:56,654
Cool.

594
00:21:57,145 --> 00:21:58,317
Cool.

595
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:00,982
Well, you'll get her someday.

596
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,199
Rooting for you.

597
00:22:03,224 --> 00:22:04,357
Yeah.

598
00:22:06,381 --> 00:22:08,515
See? That wasn't awkward at all.

599
00:22:10,514 --> 00:22:12,114
Chris?

600
00:22:21,013 --> 00:22:22,457
It's a little awkward.

601
00:22:22,982 --> 00:22:24,184
I'll get it. I'm gonna get it.

602
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,942
Mmm. That's good.

603
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:30,454
Whoops.

604
00:22:30,456 --> 00:22:31,801
This place is nice.

605
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,395
I've never been to a place where
they give you your own jacket.

606
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,960
Do I get to keep this?

607
00:22:35,962 --> 00:22:37,864
No.

608
00:22:38,931 --> 00:22:40,520
- No?
- So listen...

609
00:22:40,545 --> 00:22:43,133
I told everyone at work
about my new situation,

610
00:22:43,135 --> 00:22:44,935
and they were all very excited.

611
00:22:44,937 --> 00:22:47,091
- That's great.
- To meet you.

612
00:22:47,731 --> 00:22:49,417
- Really?
- Mm-hmm...

613
00:22:49,442 --> 00:22:51,809
- You want me to meet your coworkers?
- Mm-hmm.

614
00:22:51,811 --> 00:22:54,653
You know, that's not a stage
in anyone's relationship.

615
00:22:54,678 --> 00:22:56,413
Oh, what are you talking about?
It'd just be something informal.

616
00:22:56,415 --> 00:22:57,815
Just, like, a little dinner party.

617
00:22:57,817 --> 00:23:01,418
Uh, honestly, it'll be, like,
what, seven courses, tops.

618
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,035
Look, Darryl, I am really
happy for you coming out,

619
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,557
but I think you need to relax, kind of.

620
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,592
Relax? I... I am relaxed.

621
00:23:08,594 --> 00:23:10,864
Why would you think
that I'm not relaxed?

622
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,063
Uh, well, this is
kind of our first date,

623
00:23:13,065 --> 00:23:14,765
and this is the restaurant
where my parents came

624
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:16,500
for their silver wedding anniversary.

625
00:23:16,801 --> 00:23:19,503
I think we can just hang
out, you know? No strings.

626
00:23:19,505 --> 00:23:22,773
Maybe go someplace
that's flip-flop friendly.

627
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:25,142
- No strings.
- Mm.

628
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:27,745
Does that mean you're
dating other people?

629
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,547
Well, I'm... I'm not
not dating other people.

630
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:32,583
Double negatives always stress me out.

631
00:23:32,585 --> 00:23:33,717
I don't know what that means.

632
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:34,752
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

633
00:23:34,754 --> 00:23:35,986
I... I just think we should act

634
00:23:35,988 --> 00:23:38,322
like two normal people
who have kissed twice.

635
00:23:38,324 --> 00:23:40,424
You know, you can do a little exploring,

636
00:23:40,426 --> 00:23:41,725
get on a dating Web site or something,

637
00:23:41,727 --> 00:23:42,778
see what else is out there.

638
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:45,754
Okay. Okay.

639
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,692
I feel so much more
relaxed now. Thank you.

640
00:23:53,504 --> 00:23:54,477
May I?

641
00:23:58,215 --> 00:24:00,511
Anyway, I just really 
need money right now.

642
00:24:00,965 --> 00:24:02,413
I'll give you ten.

643
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:04,332
Ten thousand?

644
00:24:04,784 --> 00:24:06,417
Oh, my gosh, that's amazing.

645
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:07,751
You won't be sorry. The
guy at the store said

646
00:24:07,753 --> 00:24:09,320
it had, like, smart
cushioning or some...

647
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,754
No, ten dollars

648
00:24:10,756 --> 00:24:13,424
And if you lie down naked on
it, I'll give you an extra 25.

649
00:24:13,426 --> 00:24:15,392
I don't even need to
be here, I'll step out.

650
00:24:15,394 --> 00:24:17,434
I just need to know that it happened.

651
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,690
Okay, buddy, just leave. Get out.

652
00:24:21,654 --> 00:24:23,321
And come back in a minute.

653
00:24:23,346 --> 00:24:25,012
Being naked's not a problem for me.

654
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,822
Well, at least I still
have the rugelach from Mom.

655
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:55,059
Hmm?

656
00:24:59,171 --> 00:25:01,105
No.

657
00:25:03,175 --> 00:25:05,042
The Garfinkel ring.

658
00:25:06,402 --> 00:25:08,802
I think my mom is about to give me...

659
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,848
the Garfinkel ring.

660
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:13,617
It's been passed down in
my family for generations.

661
00:25:15,287 --> 00:25:17,654
So how much you
think I can get for this?

662
00:25:17,965 --> 00:25:20,332
Oh, also I should
mention that it was used

663
00:25:20,357 --> 00:25:21,959
in conjunction with an ox

664
00:25:21,961 --> 00:25:23,934
to purchase my
great-great-grandmother.

665
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,442
Yeah.

666
00:25:25,778 --> 00:25:28,129
Oh, and just so you know,
I'm gonna come back for it.

667
00:25:28,154 --> 00:25:30,168
I'm only selling this to
you for a couple weeks.

668
00:25:30,193 --> 00:25:31,445
Yeah, sure, great.

669
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,070
I hear that all the time.

670
00:25:35,307 --> 00:25:37,674
So what is it, huh? What is it?

671
00:25:37,676 --> 00:25:41,378
I mean, what's a pretty showered
girl like you doing here?

672
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,629
It's nothing shady.

673
00:25:42,654 --> 00:25:44,815
I'm just trying to go to Hawaii
with someone else's boyfriend.

674
00:25:44,817 --> 00:25:46,550
That came out wrong.
They're breaking up.

675
00:25:46,552 --> 00:25:47,651
It's a long story.

676
00:25:47,863 --> 00:25:49,667
All's fair in love and war.

677
00:25:50,022 --> 00:25:52,156
But there a casualties in both.

678
00:25:52,481 --> 00:25:54,124
Wow, thank you, Confucius.

679
00:25:54,126 --> 00:25:56,200
Give me the cheddar.

680
00:25:57,396 --> 00:25:58,729
Good luck, princess.

681
00:25:59,848 --> 00:26:00,764
Thank you.

682
00:26:00,766 --> 00:26:02,733
I am a princess.

683
00:26:02,735 --> 00:26:04,426
And I'm also Kate Hudson.

684
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,670
Paula and I didn't settle on a metaphor.

685
00:26:06,672 --> 00:26:08,071
Never mind. You don't know Paula.

686
00:26:08,073 --> 00:26:09,239
I'll be back for that.

687
00:26:09,241 --> 00:26:10,207
No. No, you won't.

688
00:26:10,209 --> 00:26:11,675
I'll be back after Hawaii.

689
00:26:24,557 --> 00:26:25,856
Ooh.

690
00:26:25,858 --> 00:26:27,891
I'm gonna get doughnuts
at the Chinese place.

691
00:26:27,893 --> 00:26:29,020
Yeah.

692
00:26:29,161 --> 00:26:31,795
Mom, Mom, this is so exciting.

693
00:26:31,797 --> 00:26:32,684
I am so excited.

694
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:34,020
I think it's finally gonna happen.

695
00:26:34,045 --> 00:26:35,377
'Cause Joshy told me

696
00:26:35,402 --> 00:26:37,678
that we were gonna
have a big talk tonight.

697
00:26:38,387 --> 00:26:40,442
I think he's gonna propose, Mom.

698
00:26:43,124 --> 00:26:44,700
I'm so excited.

699
00:26:44,725 --> 00:26:46,477
Ugh, I'm so relieved.

700
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,512
I've been getting worried
that something was going on,

701
00:26:48,514 --> 00:26:51,317
but now I realize that
he was just acting nervous

702
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:53,239
because he was buying me a ring.

703
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,920
Yeah, Joshy knows that I
have engagement rings on hold

704
00:26:56,922 --> 00:26:58,155
in every jewelry store in town,

705
00:26:58,157 --> 00:26:59,523
so I know he'll get the right one.

706
00:26:59,525 --> 00:27:02,192
Josh and I are finally getting engaged!

707
00:27:02,194 --> 00:27:03,460
I'm gonna celebrate

708
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:05,562
by smelling the doughnuts
at the Chinese place.

709
00:27:05,564 --> 00:27:07,989
Okay. Love me more. Bye.

710
00:27:11,552 --> 00:27:13,385
God, what have I done?

711
00:27:15,505 --> 00:27:17,205
Okay, you want these
shoes or these shoes

712
00:27:17,207 --> 00:27:18,306
for the key ceremony?

713
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,630
Paula, did you hear what I just said?

714
00:27:21,654 --> 00:27:23,910
Valencia thinks she's
gonna get proposed to.

715
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,559
And instead she's gonna find
out that she got cheated on.

716
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,734
Um, suddenly I don't feel so good.

717
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:32,869
Well, I told you not to get
doughnuts at the Chinese place.

718
00:27:32,871 --> 00:27:34,604
- It's not that.
- Okay, look.

719
00:27:35,426 --> 00:27:37,040
She is not right for him.

720
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:38,489
You know this.

721
00:27:38,514 --> 00:27:40,744
She is mean to him.
She doesn't respect him.

722
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:42,112
She treats him terribly.

723
00:27:42,114 --> 00:27:44,965
Yeah, but they've been
together a long time.

724
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,383
Yeah, too long.

725
00:27:46,385 --> 00:27:47,651
Long enough.

726
00:27:47,653 --> 00:27:49,853
Okay, you have nothing
to feel badly about, okay?

727
00:27:49,855 --> 00:27:51,521
He kissed you.

728
00:27:51,523 --> 00:27:53,189
He is clearly unhappy.

729
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:55,892
If you put it in your
fairy tale metaphor,

730
00:27:55,894 --> 00:27:58,929
this is the part where the
funny singing raccoon comes along

731
00:27:58,931 --> 00:28:00,196
and says, “You're the princess,

732
00:28:00,198 --> 00:28:02,809
and you get to rescue the
prince from the tower.”

733
00:28:04,489 --> 00:28:05,893
You're right. You're right.

734
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:07,114
- Thank you.
- You're right.

735
00:28:07,116 --> 00:28:07,965
It's not a good relationship.

736
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,309
So, put some shoes on.

737
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:10,400
Let's go.

738
00:28:10,793 --> 00:28:13,186
I... I gotta text Josh.

739
00:28:13,188 --> 00:28:14,955
And I gotta tell him
not to tell Valencia.

740
00:28:14,957 --> 00:28:16,156
It's just the right thing to do.

741
00:28:16,158 --> 00:28:17,991
What?! Are you insane?!

742
00:28:17,993 --> 00:28:18,992
Give me that.

743
00:28:19,962 --> 00:28:21,428
Give me back my phone!

744
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,063
No! Give it back to me!

745
00:28:22,088 --> 00:28:23,330
Uh, now, listen, you
are not gonna stop him

746
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:24,498
- Give it here!
- Telling her about the kiss.

747
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,223
We want them to break up.

748
00:28:26,248 --> 00:28:27,192
I swear to God I will...

749
00:28:27,217 --> 00:28:28,617
Ha-ha! Got your phone.

750
00:28:28,683 --> 00:28:30,483
- Ha-ha! Got your car keys.
- What?

751
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,262
Meet you at the ceremony. Take a
cab. I'll pay you back.

752
00:28:32,286 --> 00:28:33,408
Are you c... ?

753
00:28:33,676 --> 00:28:37,110
This never happened to Rosie O'Donnell.

754
00:28:49,715 --> 00:28:52,598
I should've known better... 
I kissed Rebecca.

755
00:28:52,623 --> 00:28:55,254
You did what? You kissed her?!

756
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,215
- I-I feel terrible. I...
- You feel terrible.

757
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,632
I got caught up in the moment in court.

758
00:28:58,634 --> 00:29:00,418
I-I don't know what
happened; I'm sorry.

759
00:29:00,443 --> 00:29:03,785
I've never... been
more sorry in my life.

760
00:29:06,524 --> 00:29:07,692
Oh...

761
00:29:19,698 --> 00:29:21,698
Say something. Please.

762
00:29:23,817 --> 00:29:25,910
Oh, wow, I mean, I... wow.

763
00:29:25,935 --> 00:29:29,340
I-I did not expect this
conversation to go like this.

764
00:29:29,365 --> 00:29:30,957
I expected something so different.

765
00:29:30,982 --> 00:29:33,504
I thought that you
were gonna ask me to...

766
00:29:34,603 --> 00:29:37,571
Never mind. I feel so stupid, I...

767
00:29:37,573 --> 00:29:39,172
I never meant to hurt you.

768
00:29:39,174 --> 00:29:41,325
Uh, this... this will
never happen again.

769
00:29:44,953 --> 00:29:46,895
I guess you want me to move out, so...

770
00:29:47,524 --> 00:29:48,990
when I come back from Hawaii...

771
00:29:49,015 --> 00:29:50,681
I didn't say that.

772
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,832
Do you love her?

773
00:30:00,097 --> 00:30:01,329
No.

774
00:30:02,363 --> 00:30:03,934
God, no.

775
00:30:20,764 --> 00:30:21,817
Josh...

776
00:30:22,543 --> 00:30:25,811
I am really, really hurt,

777
00:30:25,836 --> 00:30:29,423
but, God, I... I knew
something was going on.

778
00:30:29,425 --> 00:30:32,606
I mean, she's smart and... and different

779
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:35,403
and interesting.

780
00:30:35,455 --> 00:30:37,289
So I get it.

781
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:40,516
You're not mad at me?

782
00:30:46,592 --> 00:30:48,223
You forgive me?

783
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:51,145
Of course I forgive you, Joshy.

784
00:30:51,287 --> 00:30:53,220
I have to.

785
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:55,996
You mean everything to me.

786
00:30:57,258 --> 00:30:58,567
I love you.

787
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:14,090
No, I'll be here when
you come back from Hawaii,

788
00:31:14,115 --> 00:31:16,746
and... we'll start over again.

789
00:31:16,771 --> 00:31:18,895
Honey, I'm not going anywhere.

790
00:31:18,972 --> 00:31:20,838
Uh, I'm staying here with you.

791
00:31:20,863 --> 00:31:22,809
I don't deserve you.

792
00:31:22,878 --> 00:31:24,535
You're beautiful and

793
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,957
perfect like Madonna.

794
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:29,082
The Bible Madonna.

795
00:31:29,084 --> 00:31:30,784

I'm Kate Hudson.

We're doing the witch

Okay? Just go with it.

839
00:33:40,842 --> 00:33:43,542
Okay, so, fine, I'm the princess.

840

Oh.

00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,724
Okay.

864
00:35:05,726 --> 00:35:07,443
Tell me you didn't do it.
Please tell me you're still

865
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:08,458
going to Hawaii.

866
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:10,183
And the moment we've
all been waiting for,

867
00:35:10,351 --> 00:35:11,888
the woman of the hour,

868
00:35:11,913 --> 00:35:13,246
Rebecca Bunch.

869
00:35:34,389 --> 00:35:35,708
Ew.

870
00:35:41,326 --> 00:35:43,428
Okay, that's it.

871
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,318
- What's going on?
- With what?

872
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,787
Look, I'm not stupid.

873
00:35:47,901 --> 00:35:49,224
I think you're mad at me.

874
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:51,583
Yeah, 'cause you're so smart.

875
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:53,241
Okay, but what did I do?

876
00:35:55,642 --> 00:35:57,380
You broke my heart,

877
00:35:57,974 --> 00:36:00,186
you dumb idiot jerkface!

878
00:36:12,658 --> 00:36:15,626
Okay, I probably shouldn't
dwell on particulars,

879
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:17,183
but you broke up with me.

880
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,707
You told me to run after Rebecca.

881
00:36:18,732 --> 00:36:19,966
You did a whole song and dance.

882
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:22,833
That was a test, you moron.

883
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:25,412
And you were supposed to say, “Oh, no.

884
00:36:25,437 --> 00:36:26,669
“That's ridiculous.

885
00:36:26,694 --> 00:36:28,484
“I couldn't possibly be with her,

886
00:36:28,509 --> 00:36:30,709
“because I'm dating
you and you make me happy.

887
00:36:30,711 --> 00:36:32,277
And you're really hot.”

888
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:33,712
Oh, a test.

889
00:36:33,714 --> 00:36:36,681
God, I always fail the tests.

890
00:36:37,851 --> 00:36:39,326
I'm a jerk.

891
00:36:40,053 --> 00:36:41,853
Look.

892
00:36:41,855 --> 00:36:44,146
The mature rational side of me

893
00:36:44,171 --> 00:36:45,716
knows that you're not a jerk.

894
00:36:45,741 --> 00:36:48,904
You just don't feel the same
way about me that I do about you.

895
00:36:48,929 --> 00:36:51,463
But, so the emotional side of me

896
00:36:51,598 --> 00:36:53,794
wants to spear you through
the eye with this dart.

897
00:36:53,819 --> 00:36:55,085
Okay, I see.

898
00:36:55,308 --> 00:36:57,662
What... can I do?

899
00:36:57,704 --> 00:36:59,138
What would make this better?

900
00:36:59,993 --> 00:37:03,037
You are just gonna have to
live with the uncertainty.

901
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:07,716
'Cause I'm gonna be sad and angry,

902
00:37:07,748 --> 00:37:09,662
and you're just gonna
have to live with it.

903
00:37:10,017 --> 00:37:11,919
Because I'm not quitting this job.

904
00:37:12,384 --> 00:37:13,537
Not this time.

905
00:37:13,562 --> 00:37:14,995
'Cause I love it

906
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,020
and I'm, like, really good at it.

907
00:37:17,045 --> 00:37:17,935
You're...

908
00:37:18,485 --> 00:37:20,341
Yeah, you are.

909
00:37:21,944 --> 00:37:24,445
Heather, I'm sorry. I messed up.

910
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,568
Yeah.

911
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:28,685
But... that's, like, what you do.

912
00:37:32,406 --> 00:37:35,006
Everyone, let's get a round
of applause for our hero,

913
00:37:35,008 --> 00:37:37,357
the most wonderful woman in West Covina,

914
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:38,881
Rebecca Bunch!

915
00:37:42,015 --> 00:37:44,416
She is a true inspiration

916
00:37:44,418 --> 00:37:47,719
and the champion of our community.

917
00:37:47,721 --> 00:37:49,921
Oh, yeah.

918
00:37:55,629 --> 00:37:58,966
Sir, everything's going, um, wobbly.

919
00:37:59,221 --> 00:38:00,716
Excuse me?

920
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:03,716
I think my life is a giant turd.

921
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:05,044
What?

922
00:38:08,709 --> 00:38:10,075
He doesn't love me.

923
00:38:10,077 --> 00:38:12,010
He doesn't love me.

924
00:38:12,012 --> 00:38:14,846
I'm broke, I'm broke. I hate my life.

925
00:38:14,848 --> 00:38:16,147
I'm the villain. I hate my life.

926
00:38:16,149 --> 00:38:17,716
I'm the villain. I'm broke.

927
00:38:17,718 --> 00:38:19,084
What's wrong with me? Why
doesn't anyone love me?

928
00:38:19,086 --> 00:38:20,819
He doesn't love me. I hate my life.

929
00:38:20,821 --> 00:38:22,954
Why doesn't anyone love
me? He doesn't love me.

930
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:26,576
Um...

931
00:38:29,386 --> 00:38:30,740
Thanks.

932
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,779
We got a runner!

933
00:38:36,929 --> 00:38:39,099
Have fun in Kazakhstan!

934
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,091
I am so happy we worked everything out.

935
00:38:52,116 --> 00:38:53,683
Like, I'm soy proud of us.

936
00:38:53,797 --> 00:38:56,201
Yeah, I thought for sure
you were gonna throw me out.

937
00:38:56,226 --> 00:38:58,263
That's the old me.

938
00:38:58,288 --> 00:39:00,841
The new me is very mature and evolved.

939
00:39:04,396 --> 00:39:05,505
I'm hungry.

940
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:07,060
Should we get dinner?

941
00:39:07,085 --> 00:39:08,351
Okay, great.

942
00:39:08,376 --> 00:39:10,934
Uh, th-there's a new Indian
place on East Cameron.

943
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:12,326
- They have really good...
- Joshy!

944
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:14,417
You know Indian makes me gassy.

945
00:39:14,606 --> 00:39:16,750
- Right, right.
- Hmm.

946
00:39:17,294 --> 00:39:19,509
Uh, you should choose.

947
00:39:19,511 --> 00:39:20,777
Give me the phone.

948
00:39:20,779 --> 00:39:23,346
Okay, well, delivery probably
is gonna take forever,

949
00:39:23,348 --> 00:39:25,382
so you should, you know,
you're gonna get it.

950
00:39:29,621 --> 00:39:30,854
- Hey, man.
- Oh!

951
00:39:30,856 --> 00:39:31,888
How are you?

952
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,189
I haven't heard from you in a while.

953
00:39:33,191 --> 00:39:35,099
- Oh, wow, I'm good.
- Yeah?

954
00:39:35,124 --> 00:39:36,860
Actually, you know what? I'm great.

955
00:39:36,862 --> 00:39:38,224
I-I took your advice,

956
00:39:38,249 --> 00:39:41,665
and it's been really interesting.

957
00:39:42,092 --> 00:39:43,052
I bet.

958
00:39:43,077 --> 00:39:44,645
Yeah, I went out with
a girl named Charlie

959
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,835
and a guy named Dana

960
00:39:45,837 --> 00:39:48,238
just to make things as
confusing as possible.

961
00:39:51,243 --> 00:39:53,552
I don't want to say I don't
like anyone as much as you,

962
00:39:53,577 --> 00:39:54,568
but...

963
00:39:55,396 --> 00:39:56,833
I think I just said it.

964
00:39:58,693 --> 00:39:59,755
Hmm.

965
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,982
That's, uh,

966
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:04,143
that's really sweet.

967
00:40:05,646 --> 00:40:06,771
It is?

968
00:40:06,796 --> 00:40:07,724
Yeah.

969
00:40:10,862 --> 00:40:12,429
You know what, Darryl?

970
00:40:12,431 --> 00:40:14,130
Why don't we start over?

971
00:40:14,132 --> 00:40:15,443
Wipe the slate clean.

972
00:40:15,468 --> 00:40:16,834
Keep things simple.

973
00:40:17,269 --> 00:40:18,545
Can I buy you a boba?

974
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:19,740
Sure.

975
00:40:19,765 --> 00:40:20,797
Actually I cannot.

976
00:40:20,822 --> 00:40:22,188
'Cause I left my wallet in that blazer.

977
00:40:23,971 --> 00:40:24,970
I can spot you.

978
00:40:24,995 --> 00:40:27,232
But you still have to get in the line.

979
00:40:27,257 --> 00:40:28,724
Oh, sorry, okay.

980
00:40:50,264 --> 00:40:51,841
Dr. Akopian.

981
00:40:54,092 --> 00:40:55,301
Can I have another seat?

982
00:40:55,326 --> 00:40:56,915
I-I also would like another seat.

983
00:40:57,198 --> 00:40:58,331
Ladies, I'm so sorry,

984
00:40:58,356 --> 00:41:00,623
but today's flight is
completely sold out.

985
00:41:09,121 --> 00:41:12,419
So... we're stuck together
for the next five hours.

986
00:41:12,858 --> 00:41:14,326
You want to give it a go?

987
00:41:14,351 --> 00:41:15,650
Do some therapy?

988
00:41:15,675 --> 00:41:16,919
Okay.

989
00:41:19,068 --> 00:41:20,333
Yeah, let's do this.

990
00:41:20,391 --> 00:41:21,427
Okay.

991
00:41:23,474 --> 00:41:26,662
For starters, I was
conceived on a cruise ship.

992
00:41:27,105 --> 00:41:30,306
I think my mom must've had
some, I don't know, bad lobster.

993
00:41:30,308 --> 00:41:33,176
Because the second she felt
the sperm enter the egg,

994
00:41:33,178 --> 00:41:34,744
she got sick.

995
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,333
In my narrative, I pictured you as,

996
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:38,826
like, the funny singing raccoon.

997
00:41:38,851 --> 00:41:40,417
If you've got love problems,

998
00:41:40,442 --> 00:41:43,243
then listen to me, Paula the raccoon.

999
