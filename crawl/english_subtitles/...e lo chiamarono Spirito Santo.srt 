2
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,454
- Rosita is so strong.
- God help her.

3
00:01:33,711 --> 00:01:36,035
It will be over soon.

4
00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:49,132
- It's a boy.
- A boy!

5
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:51,979
My son.

6
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:58,448
He's a strong one, that's why
you didn't lose him in the street.

7
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,650
A dove!

8
00:02:08,297 --> 00:02:10,722
The Holy Ghost!

9
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:17,863
'...And They Called Him Holy Ghost'

10
00:04:34,502 --> 00:04:36,743
Get to work.

11
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:23,641
Move it, skunk!
Don't expect any mercy, get up.

12
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:27,837
Come on, brother.
Stand up.

13
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:32,480
- Remember, this isn't a holiday camp.
- Try to stand up.

14
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,878
I'd rather die.

15
00:05:38,413 --> 00:05:41,611
Don't just stand there.
Get to work.

16
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:44,480
If you don't want to eat.
Move it.

17
00:05:44,481 --> 00:05:46,730
You idle pig.

18
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:50,501
I'll have you whipped if you
don't get up.

19
00:05:55,052 --> 00:05:58,220
I'll make you curse the day
you were born...

20
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:00,722
You can do it.
You just need a good whipping!

21
00:06:05,153 --> 00:06:07,036
What are you waiting for?

22
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:10,100
I've had enough of you.

23
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,313
You damned dog!

24
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:32,682
What are you doing?
Get back to work.

25
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:38,383
Don't move, damn it.
You'll regret it.

26
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,040
- I'll make you regret you'd ever been born.
- I'll never regret it.

27
00:06:50,474 --> 00:06:53,879
That's going to cost you something
ten times worse than your sentence...

28
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,787
I'm going to enjoy this!
Tie him to the wheel.

29
00:06:56,788 --> 00:07:00,195
And make sure it's facing the sun!
You'll have no bread or water...

30
00:07:00,196 --> 00:07:04,169
I'll leave you there for three days,
until the sun has dried your veins.

31
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,152
And that's just the start.
Take him away!

32
00:07:07,153 --> 00:07:10,103
I want to enjoy this show immediately.

33
00:07:32,963 --> 00:07:38,719
Take a good look at the sun,
and don't expect any shade.

34
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:47,733
The blood in your veins will
start to boil soon.

35
00:07:51,112 --> 00:07:53,907
Are you thirsty, Holy Ghost?

36
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,892
Okay, I won't force you to drink
if you aren't...

37
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:02,188
But maybe tomorrow,
or the day after.

38
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:04,938
- No.
- Call me when you've had enough.

39
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:08,650
- No, I won't call you.
- Then I'll poke you every now and then.

40
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:49,235
And now a five mile mile walk to
loosen your limbs...

41
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:51,930
Then you can sleep among the
bugs and lice.

42
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,900
March!

43
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,404
Move out.

44
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,215
It's an order signed by the
 Federal judge.

45
00:09:14,216 --> 00:09:15,884
Let me see.

46
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:18,938
I have to take one of your
prisoners to Tucson.

47
00:09:18,939 --> 00:09:22,818
- Which prisoner would that be?
- It's written there...

48
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,950
You can read it,
his name is Jack Falton...

49
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:29,421
But they've called him Holy Ghost
since he was born.

50
00:09:29,722 --> 00:09:32,357
A strange name for a paleface.

51
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:35,117
But he has to do twenty years
of forced labour.

52
00:09:35,118 --> 00:09:39,423
He has to testify in court to
exonerate a man accused of murder.

53
00:09:39,424 --> 00:09:43,376
- When he has completed this task...
- This is a good opportunity...

54
00:09:43,377 --> 00:09:46,152
- Take advantage of it.
- Yes.

55
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:49,799
- Don't waste it.
- I already thought about it, I'll try.

56
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:54,301
But it won't be easy to outwit an
Indian who made it to Sheriff...

57
00:09:54,786 --> 00:09:58,145
- The only one in history.
- I'll answer personally for the prisoner...

58
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:02,589
They'll have to kill us before
they take him from me and my men.

59
00:10:04,644 --> 00:10:08,016
Okay, take him.
But be careful, he's dangerous.

60
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:11,599
Everyone in the county knows him.
Don't worry, he won't have many chances...

61
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,999
I'll bring him back safe and sound.

62
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:20,658
Remove the chains from Holy Ghost
and hand him over to the sheriff.

63
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:17,287
We'll set up camp here.

64
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,749
Come with me.

65
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:38,184
And no tricks, if you value your life.

66
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,223
Some coffee, boss.

67
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:30,613
Take it...
We want you in good shape for the trial.

68
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:36,502
Hey, buddy...

69
00:17:37,094 --> 00:17:38,892
Come here.

70
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:42,527
- You're free.
- Who are you?

71
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,926
Mr. Foster will tell you,
he's waiting at his ranch.

72
00:18:22,316 --> 00:18:24,257
I'll kill him!

73
00:18:24,908 --> 00:18:26,944
No...
Stop.

74
00:18:27,145 --> 00:18:29,299
What's wrong with you?

75
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,706
- Let's go, there's no need to kill him.
- Why?

76
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:37,708
This act of kindness will cost
you dearly, Holy Ghost.

77
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:39,602
I have my reasons.

78
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:20,449
- Welcome to my ranch.
- Thanks.

79
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,042
- Where's Jim?
- He was killed.

80
00:19:25,354 --> 00:19:27,519
I'm sorry.

81
00:19:28,755 --> 00:19:31,657
My daughter, Consuelo.
A friend.

82
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,837
Your father saved my life many years ago
and I wanted to settle the score...

83
00:19:38,195 --> 00:19:42,443
I don't like being in debt to anyone,
but we'll talk about that later.

84
00:19:42,544 --> 00:19:45,881
You can go...
Let's go in, you must be tired.

85
00:19:51,262 --> 00:19:53,547
Have a seat.

86
00:19:55,475 --> 00:19:57,977
There's no need to be polite.

87
00:20:01,998 --> 00:20:04,948
- But you're injured.
- Yes, it's nothing.

88
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:07,719
Wait, I'll get some medicine.

89
00:20:09,857 --> 00:20:13,448
My daughter can do everything,
she's a marvellous girl...

90
00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:16,144
My life would be meaningless
without her...

91
00:20:16,145 --> 00:20:20,176
Since I lost my wife.
She died giving birth to her.

92
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,813
She was Spanish,
I've never met another woman like her.

93
00:20:27,846 --> 00:20:31,116
You'll be my guest for a few days,
but there's a condition...

94
00:20:31,117 --> 00:20:35,509
You can't leave the ranch because
it might be dangerous for both of us.

95
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:39,260
You can rest here.

96
00:20:39,261 --> 00:20:43,917
And when things calm down
I'll take you to the border.

97
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,667
Sounds good to me.
Thank you.

98
00:20:49,712 --> 00:20:51,776
Here comes our nurse.

99
00:20:52,996 --> 00:20:55,095
He's all yours, dear.

100
00:20:57,246 --> 00:20:59,138
Let's have a look...

101
00:20:59,763 --> 00:21:02,082
These cuts can easily get infected.

102
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:06,658
- I hope this doesn't hurt.
- With your delicate hands...

103
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:10,410
- It would be impossible to hurt me.
- I'll take care of you, personally.

104
00:21:11,476 --> 00:21:16,679
You'll be back to normal in a few days,
if you follow my advice.

105
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,738
Okay?

106
00:21:22,021 --> 00:21:24,074
How do you feel now?

107
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:27,388
Much better, right?

108
00:21:27,389 --> 00:21:31,598
Make this quick, our guest must
be hungry and it's already late.

109
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:33,487
I've finished.

110
00:21:34,997 --> 00:21:39,542
For a doctor like her I could
go without food for three days.

111
00:21:42,203 --> 00:21:45,204
But how did you know I'd be there?

112
00:21:51,221 --> 00:21:53,492
You can go.
Come on, father...

113
00:21:53,493 --> 00:21:58,001
- We're all dying to know your secret.
- You see...

114
00:21:58,002 --> 00:22:03,136
I'm a good friend of the Federal judge,
that's how I knew he wanted you in Tucson.

115
00:22:03,812 --> 00:22:06,559
It wasn't difficult to organise
your kidnapping...

116
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,199
But I didn't want anyone to die.
Those weren't my orders.

117
00:22:10,743 --> 00:22:15,527
Sadly, these things are inevitable,
no matter how good your intentions.

118
00:22:15,528 --> 00:22:19,648
Yes, I understand,
but I'm against violence of any kind...

119
00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:22,283
And I don't want any trouble
with the law.

120
00:22:22,284 --> 00:22:25,570
- Now let's drink!
- Your wine really is excellent.

121
00:23:21,482 --> 00:23:24,656
If you're looking for a good horse,
don't look at them...

122
00:23:25,373 --> 00:23:28,520
They're nags with something
on their conscience.

123
00:23:33,122 --> 00:23:37,161
Come over here,
these are all thoroughbreds.

124
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:57,541
That one even knows morse code.
It's quite a horse!

125
00:24:02,864 --> 00:24:06,002
That one works very well with lawmen.

126
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:19,379
- How much?
- $20 wouldn't even pay for his shoes...

127
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,638
But you can have him.
Three of my horses starved to death last week...

128
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:26,582
So I need money to feed the others.

129
00:24:26,783 --> 00:24:31,016
I don't eat much myself,
but I need something to keep my on my feet.

130
00:24:31,117 --> 00:24:33,456
You've persuaded me.

131
00:24:38,401 --> 00:24:40,017
Thanks!

132
00:24:40,018 --> 00:24:43,810
It kills me to sell my horses.
You got a great deal.

133
00:24:43,811 --> 00:24:46,604
That remains to be seen,
but I'll find out soon enough.

134
00:24:46,705 --> 00:24:49,335
- Bon appetit.
- You kidding?

135
00:24:49,336 --> 00:24:51,408
It's all for the horses.

136
00:24:56,376 --> 00:24:59,714
When I think how much these
 damned horses eat!

137
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:58,954
You surprised me, Sheriff.
I rarely get visitors at this hour.

138
00:27:58,955 --> 00:28:04,857
An old friend can stop by any time.
Especially if it's to give you a warning.

139
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:11,577
- I don't need warnings, Sheriff.
- I see you're in fine company.

140
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:16,243
They're the only honest friends I've got.

141
00:28:16,244 --> 00:28:19,266
Take them away then tell me what
I have left in this world?

142
00:28:19,267 --> 00:28:21,284
Men?
No thanks!

143
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:23,659
They're worse than lice.

144
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,039
What do you want from me, Sheriff?

145
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,518
You haven't come here to tell me
I have lice, or that I'm not too smart...

146
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:33,789
Why have you come all the way here?

147
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:38,584
- Holy Ghost managed to escape.
- Holy Ghost! Great!

148
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:43,563
- You're happy he got away.
- I can't lie to you...

149
00:28:43,564 --> 00:28:45,923
I would've done the same thing.

150
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:50,155
- I'm sure he'll come here.
- Why would he do that?

151
00:28:50,976 --> 00:28:55,161
To collect the loot from his last
robbery, for example...

152
00:28:55,847 --> 00:29:01,701
Everyone in the village says Holy Ghost
has made his nest here, in this old mine.

153
00:29:02,531 --> 00:29:07,209
- You wouldn't know anything about that?
- They're just stories...

154
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,305
If there was any gold here
I'd have found it...

155
00:29:10,306 --> 00:29:12,824
And I wouldn't still be here,
believe me.

156
00:29:12,825 --> 00:29:16,057
When they arrested Holy Ghost
I set up camp in this mine...

157
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:19,969
Convinced I'd find gold,
but all I found was lice.

158
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:24,097
No, you'd be lucky to find a
dollar here, Sheriff...

159
00:29:24,098 --> 00:29:27,856
And Holy Ghost wouldn't set
foot in this place.

160
00:29:29,617 --> 00:29:33,894
If you dare give him even a small piece
of bread I'll arrest you, understood?

161
00:29:33,895 --> 00:29:35,928
You can go back to sleep.

162
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:39,335
A warned man is half saved.

163
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:42,807
It's a proverb I learnt from the white folk.

164
00:32:37,132 --> 00:32:38,926
Goodnight.

165
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:46,377
Are you waiting for me?

166
00:32:49,586 --> 00:32:51,300
Don't try it.

167
00:32:53,153 --> 00:32:55,252
Throw it by my feet.

168
00:32:55,911 --> 00:32:57,682
Like that, good.

169
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:02,452
Now go... Holy Ghost never kills
the first time round.

170
00:33:28,748 --> 00:33:31,978
What a surprise!
Holy Ghost in the flesh!

171
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,667
The Sheriff was right,
that crazy redskin...

172
00:33:36,668 --> 00:33:40,203
- He was right!
- Is this how you greet an old friend?

173
00:33:40,807 --> 00:33:43,378
Listen carefully, Holy Ghost...

174
00:33:43,379 --> 00:33:46,610
I'm really glad to see you...

175
00:33:46,811 --> 00:33:50,982
But that damned Indian that's looking
for you, I don't like him one bit!

176
00:33:50,983 --> 00:33:54,925
Yes, I know, he's worse than
a hound that won't let go.

177
00:33:55,737 --> 00:33:59,168
Now tell me, how do you know
he's looking for me?

178
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:01,095
How do I know?

179
00:34:01,096 --> 00:34:05,425
Because he woke me up in the middle of
the night to tell me you'd escaped.

180
00:34:05,426 --> 00:34:08,504
I don't think he got over the
death of his sister...

181
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:12,642
He's convinced you killed her,
and he won't give up!

182
00:34:12,643 --> 00:34:15,592
Until he proves it in court.

183
00:34:16,224 --> 00:34:20,272
I'm just worried they might
start blaming me!

184
00:34:20,866 --> 00:34:24,655
Look, my friend,
I want to be honest with you...

185
00:34:24,656 --> 00:34:27,926
I don't want to end up in jail
and pick up new lice...

186
00:34:27,927 --> 00:34:32,226
And that damned redskin will send me to jail
if I even give you a piece of bread...

187
00:34:32,227 --> 00:34:34,316
He made it quite clear.

188
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:38,794
Don't worry, he'll never put
you in jail...

189
00:34:38,795 --> 00:34:41,965
And if he tries,
he'll have to go up against me.

190
00:34:41,966 --> 00:34:46,486
- But he said I should turn you in.
- I'll leave once I get my gold.

191
00:34:46,487 --> 00:34:51,015
- But there's nothing here.
- Have faith, you'll see.

192
00:34:51,016 --> 00:34:53,795
- Come on.
- You still think it's here?

193
00:34:53,796 --> 00:34:57,626
They must have taken it soon after
you hid it or I'd have found it...

194
00:34:57,627 --> 00:35:01,627
Where could you have hidden it?
I searched everywhere.

195
00:35:01,628 --> 00:35:04,898
I'll tell you,
under the beams in the old mine...

196
00:35:04,899 --> 00:35:07,358
At the other end.
That's where it is.

197
00:35:09,293 --> 00:35:14,050
- I don't believe you!
- You'll laugh a lot less when you see it.

198
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:19,067
I get the impression the lice didn't
just stop on your head...

199
00:35:19,068 --> 00:35:22,080
But they got right into your brain!

200
00:35:22,081 --> 00:35:25,415
You've lost your touch,
but you'll recover, you're young.

201
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:28,412
Come on, let's see which one
of us is crazy.

202
00:35:28,513 --> 00:35:30,521
I already know.

203
00:35:45,929 --> 00:35:49,814
Let's see.
One, two, three...

204
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:52,257
Have you found it?

205
00:35:53,272 --> 00:35:55,100
Four...

206
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,581
Let's go that way.

207
00:36:16,127 --> 00:36:17,991
Damn it.

208
00:36:20,271 --> 00:36:22,503
I don't remember.

209
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,216
Then I'll tell you...
Two steps forward!

210
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:32,304
Two steps back.

211
00:36:32,305 --> 00:36:34,783
Then take a bow...

212
00:36:34,784 --> 00:36:37,366
And the gold will come to you,
just like in a fairy tale...

213
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:40,590
Like when we used to go dancing
in the countryside...

214
00:36:40,591 --> 00:36:44,583
You should've seen how the women
bowed back then!

215
00:36:44,584 --> 00:36:48,222
Tits full of fresh milk!
It was great!

216
00:36:48,223 --> 00:36:50,526
Come and have a look.

217
00:36:50,727 --> 00:36:53,253
Almost there, old man.

218
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:04,945
Hurry up!

219
00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:11,287
- Now do you believe me?
- Christ! That's gold!

220
00:37:11,488 --> 00:37:14,310
Hit me!
Tell me it isn't a dream!

221
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,548
I really am awake!

222
00:37:19,636 --> 00:37:21,317
I've been such a fool...

223
00:37:21,452 --> 00:37:24,625
To think, I looked everywhere for it
when they put you inside...

224
00:37:24,626 --> 00:37:27,597
I had to find it!
I thought they'd hang you.

225
00:37:27,598 --> 00:37:31,581
- Would've been a shame to waste it.
- So you were upset when they didn't hang me.

226
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,850
No...
I wouldn't say I was upset...

227
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:40,326
But I knew you'd be glad I found it
instead of someone else.

228
00:37:40,327 --> 00:37:43,169
You're only making this worse
 for yourself.

229
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,897
I can't believe it's real.

230
00:37:46,527 --> 00:37:51,379
Relax, they're real.
And there are some for you.

231
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,827
It's only fair, I prevented anyone
else from finding it...

232
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:57,912
I took very good care of it.

233
00:38:08,403 --> 00:38:10,032
Are you okay?

234
00:38:11,157 --> 00:38:12,708
Don't move.

235
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:17,007
- I can't feel my legs.
- I'll move it.

236
00:38:17,008 --> 00:38:20,239
I feel like an egg stuck to a pan.

237
00:38:24,705 --> 00:38:26,733
Holy Ghost!

238
00:38:27,284 --> 00:38:31,940
You're trapped, Holy Ghost.
Surrender, you're surrounded.

239
00:38:32,762 --> 00:38:36,941
- There's no escape.
- Save yourself!

240
00:38:36,942 --> 00:38:40,211
Save your breath,
I don't abandon my friends.

241
00:38:45,984 --> 00:38:47,907
Save yourself.

242
00:38:48,008 --> 00:38:50,239
There's still time.

243
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:54,202
You can use the hole they used
to take out the provisions...

244
00:38:54,203 --> 00:38:57,190
Leave me.
Let me die in peace.

245
00:38:57,191 --> 00:39:01,161
- After so much pain!
- My patience has a limit...

246
00:39:01,162 --> 00:39:06,775
There's no way out, you have five
minutes to come out with your hands up.

247
00:39:17,043 --> 00:39:19,369
Your share, old man.

248
00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:22,086
You can still have it.

249
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:37,087
This is your last warning.
Come out, you're surrounded.

250
00:41:22,806 --> 00:41:25,617
I thought I told you not
to leave the ranch...

251
00:41:25,618 --> 00:41:31,135
- Why didn't you respect my wishes?
- I had a personal matter to take care of...

252
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:35,653
- Sorry, but I had no other choice.
- What if someone followed you?

253
00:41:35,654 --> 00:41:38,605
- No one followed me.
- I hope so, for your sake.

254
00:41:39,525 --> 00:41:43,526
Otherwise you'll pay!
I won't stand for any mistakes.

255
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:46,315
Don't you think you're exaggerating?

256
00:41:46,316 --> 00:41:50,171
- What is all this noise?
- Nothing, dear!

257
00:41:51,158 --> 00:41:55,138
Nothing serious, merely a heated
exchange between gentlemen.

258
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:58,658
- Then come and have breakfast.
- Of course, dear.

259
00:42:28,716 --> 00:42:32,010
- Biscuit?
- Did you make them?

260
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,649
This is the reason for my mistake...

261
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,944
Or I wouldn't have left the ranch,
where I feel quite at home...

262
00:42:57,945 --> 00:43:00,349
Is that good enough?

263
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:04,444
I hid them in the old Wilson Mine
before I was arrested.

264
00:43:04,445 --> 00:43:06,445
It's fabulous...

265
00:43:06,446 --> 00:43:10,479
I've never seen a gold ingot
shine so brightly.

266
00:43:11,111 --> 00:43:14,773
- Where did you find them?
- That's all in the past.

267
00:43:14,874 --> 00:43:17,312
I would take too long to explain.

268
00:43:17,413 --> 00:43:20,704
Anyway, there's another reason
why I left the ranch...

269
00:43:20,705 --> 00:43:24,023
I wouldn't have risked everything
for a sack of gold...

270
00:43:25,472 --> 00:43:28,504
- I had a very important reason.
- Such as?

271
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:32,928
A large convoy of gold is going to
cross this state next month...

272
00:43:32,929 --> 00:43:36,239
I have all the necessary
information on this map...

273
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,137
To get the gold when it passes
this precise point...

274
00:43:40,138 --> 00:43:42,016
According to my plan.

275
00:43:42,017 --> 00:43:46,582
It's more gold than we could
possibly spend in our lifetime.

276
00:43:46,783 --> 00:43:50,535
I'll need at least twenty
trustworthy men...

277
00:43:52,879 --> 00:43:55,747
If you're interested we can
do it together.

278
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:09,776
Okay.

279
00:44:10,294 --> 00:44:13,175
I'll give you the details at
the right time...

280
00:44:13,176 --> 00:44:16,262
For now I need you to get
hold of some military uniforms.

281
00:44:16,263 --> 00:44:19,922
I want to know the plan,
if you need me...

282
00:44:20,123 --> 00:44:23,577
- Otherwise you can do it alone.
- Okay.

283
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:27,415
I need someone who knows how
to use a machine-gun.

284
00:44:53,581 --> 00:44:56,987
A strange place to do
business like this, right?

285
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,592
Are we here as tourists?
I don't see anyone here.

286
00:45:18,693 --> 00:45:21,902
Right, we don't see anyone...

287
00:45:21,903 --> 00:45:25,286
But we hear someone.
A fine artist!

288
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:31,119
We'll wait next door.

289
00:45:44,485 --> 00:45:49,678
I know him well, he won't come until
he's finished playing this piece.

290
00:45:59,821 --> 00:46:01,872
Now he'll come.

291
00:46:27,677 --> 00:46:30,307
Excuse my lateness...

292
00:46:31,983 --> 00:46:34,850
But music is my calling.

293
00:46:39,626 --> 00:46:42,964
I too would like to be a slave
to a calling like yours.

294
00:46:43,065 --> 00:46:47,034
- It's the ghost that haunts me.
- Speaking of ghosts...

295
00:46:47,035 --> 00:46:50,481
- This is Holy Ghost.
- My Lord.

296
00:46:58,255 --> 00:47:00,247
Holy Ghost.

297
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,039
I hope you're worthy of this name.

298
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,534
Let's hurry, my faithful congregation
awaits my music.

299
00:47:08,535 --> 00:47:11,670
- It's sublime to listen to you.
- Thank you.

300
00:47:11,671 --> 00:47:16,064
- I'm merely the vessel of many spirits.
- I won't keep you any longer...

301
00:47:16,065 --> 00:47:19,718
We'll get straight to the point.
Holy Ghost will explain.

302
00:47:20,619 --> 00:47:22,669
I'm listening.

303
00:47:23,137 --> 00:47:26,102
I'll make this brief.
Twenty days from now...

304
00:47:26,103 --> 00:47:29,783
A military escort will be
transporting a convoy of gold...

305
00:47:30,171 --> 00:47:35,131
This is the route it will take,
and this is where they'll change escort...

306
00:47:36,388 --> 00:47:38,914
It happens every fifty miles...

307
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:43,411
The last stop is Fort Standel,
where it is meant to be stored...

308
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:47,064
But we'll make sure the gold
never gets there...

309
00:47:47,065 --> 00:47:49,840
Because if we follow my precise plan...

310
00:47:49,841 --> 00:47:52,642
At a certain point on its journey...

311
00:47:52,643 --> 00:47:56,657
It will fall into our hands like a gift
from the Holy Ghost!

312
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,515
I thought you were working.

313
00:48:07,442 --> 00:48:13,332
Indeed, I'm resting because
I've been working since dawn.

314
00:48:14,162 --> 00:48:17,304
- Why don't you join me?
- I'm coming.

315
00:48:23,718 --> 00:48:25,864
It's marvellous!

316
00:48:41,409 --> 00:48:45,563
- What about the uniforms?
- Don't you think of anything else?

317
00:48:48,604 --> 00:48:52,458
You could think of something
different here, something more poetic.

318
00:48:58,506 --> 00:49:02,593
You're right, but I'm worried.
We don't have much time.

319
00:49:02,594 --> 00:49:06,959
If the uniforms aren't ready on
time it will ruin everything...

320
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,800
- It will be too late.
- I know...

321
00:49:10,389 --> 00:49:12,897
But the uniforms will be ready.

322
00:49:13,404 --> 00:49:15,185
Don't worry.

323
00:49:17,228 --> 00:49:18,986
Consuelo...

324
00:49:20,087 --> 00:49:22,345
- Get back to work.
- Why?

325
00:49:22,446 --> 00:49:26,365
-Then I won't have to worry.
- Yes, sir!

326
00:49:32,632 --> 00:49:35,303
Are you satisfied with what
you've seen?

327
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:39,839
I wouldn't want to misinterpret
your silence.

328
00:49:40,737 --> 00:49:45,908
- It seems I've left you speechless.
- I'm out of words and out of breath...

329
00:49:45,909 --> 00:49:48,868
- It's been like that since the first day.
- Really?

330
00:49:48,969 --> 00:49:51,865
Actually, I feel the same, too.

331
00:49:53,442 --> 00:49:56,625
Then I'll marry you and we'll go
to Mexico together.

332
00:49:57,659 --> 00:50:02,292
- And if I don't want to marry you?
- You wouldn't have let me see you like that.

333
00:50:02,393 --> 00:50:04,987
What's that got to do with it?

334
00:50:06,871 --> 00:50:12,102
- I thought you'd turn around.
- It's not true, you did it on purpose.

335
00:50:13,658 --> 00:50:16,664
And you did it because you
know I love you.

336
00:50:16,665 --> 00:50:19,030
- Will you marry me?
- I'll think about it...

337
00:50:19,031 --> 00:50:23,669
- First I want to see the gold.
- Okay, if that's why you want to marry me.

338
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:25,876
No, not only that.

339
00:50:53,465 --> 00:50:58,277
- The route seems quite clear.
- We've seen everything we need.

340
00:50:58,278 --> 00:51:02,577
- It's just the station left.
- The last stop, but the most important.

341
00:51:02,678 --> 00:51:04,205
Let's go.

342
00:52:00,518 --> 00:52:02,830
That's the station.

343
00:52:07,143 --> 00:52:08,919
Look, Steve.

344
00:52:13,294 --> 00:52:17,435
So the last change over will take
place at that station...

345
00:52:17,436 --> 00:52:20,522
- Are you sure?
- That's what the map says.

346
00:52:21,544 --> 00:52:24,451
Let's pray it all goes well.

347
00:52:33,258 --> 00:52:37,417
We won't have much time.
It isn't going to be easy.

348
00:52:37,418 --> 00:52:41,483
As long as we stick to the plan
we can't fail...

349
00:52:41,484 --> 00:52:44,563
Obviously, we can't afford to 
make any mistakes.

350
00:52:45,856 --> 00:52:49,726
The slightest error,
and it will all go wrong.

351
00:52:49,727 --> 00:52:53,070
We can return to the farm.
Let's go.

352
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:26,306
Your father was up late.
He's worried about tomorrow.

353
00:53:26,307 --> 00:53:29,865
Yes, I know, he's worried
someone might get killed...

354
00:53:29,866 --> 00:53:33,761
- You won't harm them, will you?
- Not a hair on their head!

355
00:53:35,381 --> 00:53:39,605
I hope so.
Because now we've gone this far...

356
00:53:39,606 --> 00:53:43,295
Now everything is ready,
and we can't go back...

357
00:53:43,296 --> 00:53:46,371
- I'm scared!
- Of what?

358
00:53:54,477 --> 00:53:56,214
I don't know.

359
00:53:56,215 --> 00:53:59,894
Of what might happen to you,
or my father...

360
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,730
I'm worried about both of you.

361
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,608
No, my love...

362
00:54:15,704 --> 00:54:18,419
There's no need to be scared...

363
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:21,274
Everything will be okay, you'll see.

364
00:54:21,275 --> 00:54:25,573
In a few days we'll be in Santa Cruz,
free, happy, rich.

365
01:00:30,166 --> 01:00:33,086
- Where are you coming from?
- From Fort Laramie.

366
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:37,361
- I just finished escorting some gold.
- Are you waiting for the change over?

367
01:00:37,362 --> 01:00:41,570
Yes, that's right.
I thought you were my replacement...

368
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:45,345
But then I noticed you were alone,
and you had another wagon...

369
01:00:46,088 --> 01:00:48,967
Speaking of which, your cargo
looks more valuable than mine...

370
01:00:48,968 --> 01:00:51,109
The way you've secured it.

371
01:00:51,765 --> 01:00:55,318
Indeed, I'm carrying rifles,
they can be more precious than gold...

372
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:56,918
Depending on the circumstances...

373
01:01:05,054 --> 01:01:07,102
Untie your belt.

374
01:01:08,663 --> 01:01:10,387
Hands up!

375
01:01:11,283 --> 01:01:13,265
Everyone inside!

376
01:01:13,751 --> 01:01:16,224
Good... 
Very good!

377
01:01:16,325 --> 01:01:18,263
Everyone inside!

378
01:01:19,215 --> 01:01:20,779
Come on!

379
01:01:23,496 --> 01:01:25,264
Help me!

380
01:01:30,242 --> 01:01:31,867
You as well.

381
01:01:32,981 --> 01:01:37,580
- Start walking!
- Careful, Lieutenant, he's very nervous!

382
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:42,151
Let's go inside.

383
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:59,478
Take this wagon away,
and get the one with the gold.

384
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:10,830
Our escort is coming.

385
01:02:51,171 --> 01:02:53,523
Don't be afraid.

386
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:57,443
The fifth commandment says...

387
01:03:05,543 --> 01:03:09,608
'Thou shalt not kill'
But I don't want any witnesses!

388
01:03:23,547 --> 01:03:26,007
Nothing personal.

389
01:04:29,818 --> 01:04:32,099
Still no sign of him.

390
01:05:50,823 --> 01:05:53,889
There's no point looking for me.
I'm over here!

391
01:05:54,498 --> 01:05:56,718
Stop!
 Holy Ghost!

392
01:06:31,534 --> 01:06:33,976
What are you doing?
Don't kill me!

393
01:06:58,315 --> 01:06:59,965
Have mercy!

394
01:07:06,245 --> 01:07:08,027
I didn't do anything!

395
01:07:11,141 --> 01:07:14,397
- I'll kill you like a dog!
- No, have mercy!

396
01:07:19,177 --> 01:07:21,408
Where are you going?
Come here!

397
01:07:22,461 --> 01:07:24,702
I'm leaving...

398
01:10:00,069 --> 01:10:03,040
I should've known I couldn't trust you.

399
01:10:03,041 --> 01:10:05,791
Why don't you ask me what happened?

400
01:10:05,792 --> 01:10:08,738
I heard the gunfire,
and now I see you're alone.

401
01:10:08,739 --> 01:10:12,382
It doesn't take much to figure
out what happened.

402
01:10:12,383 --> 01:10:16,454
If I wanted to do it alone,
I wouldn't have come here...

403
01:10:16,455 --> 01:10:19,165
I would have headed off in the
other direction.

404
01:10:19,166 --> 01:10:24,521
You came here to get rid of me
like you got rid of them

405
01:10:25,297 --> 01:10:29,095
But you messed up.
You underestimated me...

406
01:10:29,096 --> 01:10:31,214
Because I'm going to kill you!

407
01:10:31,822 --> 01:10:35,124
Leave the rifle on the ground.
Now listen carefully...

408
01:10:35,613 --> 01:10:40,230
- Why don't you kill me, Holy Ghost?
- Because I have no intention of killing you.

409
01:10:40,231 --> 01:10:42,389
- It was Steve.
- Steve?

410
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:45,837
It was all going well until
he started laughing like a lunatic.

411
01:10:45,938 --> 01:10:49,008
- Go on.
- He killed both of the escorts...

412
01:10:49,009 --> 01:10:51,872
And he tried to kill me as well.

413
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:55,695
He wanted it all for himself.
He laughed... He laughed like a madman!

414
01:10:55,696 --> 01:10:59,359
But he won't get his share anymore,
because I had to kill him.

415
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:02,765
Let's move the gold.
We can't waste any time.

416
01:11:02,766 --> 01:11:05,750
- We'll go straight to the ranch.
- As you wish.

417
01:11:05,751 --> 01:11:09,735
Someone might have heard the shots.
It isn't wise to stay here.

418
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:02,935
- At last! Did it all go well?
- Yes, the gold is here.

419
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:05,647
Something terrible happened.

420
01:12:06,735 --> 01:12:08,902
- Steve betrayed us.
- No!

421
01:12:08,903 --> 01:12:11,429
He killed everyone,
and he tried to kill me.

422
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:14,420
Let's not waste time.
We need to burn the wagon...

423
01:12:14,421 --> 01:12:17,435
And anything else that might
compromise us.

424
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:20,783
But now I'm tired.
Take care of our guest...

425
01:12:20,784 --> 01:12:23,930
Come and see me when you've finished,
I need to talk to you.

426
01:13:13,098 --> 01:13:16,977
- You were quick.
- Holy Ghost didn't want to eat anything.

427
01:13:17,178 --> 01:13:21,144
He went straight to his room.
He was very tired.

428
01:13:21,145 --> 01:13:24,176
- Daddy, you must recognise...
- Yes, of course.

429
01:13:24,177 --> 01:13:27,703
Listen, my child,
I have something to tell you...

430
01:13:32,114 --> 01:13:34,945
Sit down, my dear.

431
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:38,377
Come on, don't keep me in suspense.

432
01:13:39,489 --> 01:13:41,938
Listen, Consuelo...

433
01:13:42,139 --> 01:13:45,050
It's about Holy Ghost.

434
01:13:46,695 --> 01:13:49,153
He isn't what he seems...

435
01:13:49,529 --> 01:13:53,100
He's a bandit.
A man without morals.

436
01:13:53,201 --> 01:13:55,054
- Perhaps.
- Believe me.

437
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:58,179
He's always behaved like a gentleman.

438
01:13:58,180 --> 01:13:59,896
Sure...

439
01:14:00,713 --> 01:14:02,261
Sure.

440
01:14:02,262 --> 01:14:06,788
He only tried to kill me,
and I assure you he'll try again.

441
01:14:06,789 --> 01:14:11,695
- How can you think such a thing?
- I don't believe his version of events!

442
01:14:13,179 --> 01:14:15,562
It just doesn't make sense.

443
01:14:15,763 --> 01:14:18,078
I genuinely regret helping him.

444
01:14:18,962 --> 01:14:21,549
You owe it to him,
if you're rich now.

445
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:23,982
If he's a bandit,
then you're worse than him.

446
01:14:23,983 --> 01:14:27,140
And so am I.
Because I knew what I was doing.

447
01:14:27,141 --> 01:14:29,506
Accusing him,
you're accusing yourself.

448
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:33,192
- You can't deny it.
- But he tried to kill me!

449
01:14:34,211 --> 01:14:36,919
You already told me,
but I'll never believe you.

450
01:14:37,326 --> 01:14:41,310
He had a thousand opportunities
to kill you...

451
01:14:41,311 --> 01:14:44,005
Steve was a lunatic and you knew that.

452
01:14:44,006 --> 01:14:46,698
You asked for his help.
He isn't to blame.

453
01:14:46,699 --> 01:14:49,243
He was the only one with a
machine-gun who knew how to use it.

454
01:14:49,244 --> 01:14:51,376
What does that prove?

455
01:14:51,377 --> 01:14:55,224
He couldn't wait to use it
because he was a killer...

456
01:14:55,225 --> 01:14:58,424
Why else would he have
had a machine-gun?

457
01:14:58,425 --> 01:15:02,984
- How can you believe anything else?
- You may well be right...

458
01:15:04,730 --> 01:15:09,009
But it's too dangerous for us to be
associated with Holy Ghost...

459
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:12,017
There's still a bounty on his head...

460
01:15:12,018 --> 01:15:15,457
And the Sheriff in Tucson will
never stop hunting him.

461
01:15:16,505 --> 01:15:19,831
So I've decided to turn him in
to get the Sheriff off our back...

462
01:15:19,832 --> 01:15:23,215
This way I'll be able to divert any
suspicion away from me.

463
01:15:23,216 --> 01:15:26,678
No, tell me you won't do it,
or I'll have to stop you.

464
01:15:26,679 --> 01:15:29,296
You can't do it.
You're better than that...

465
01:15:29,297 --> 01:15:31,506
Don't you see,
I want to marry him!

466
01:15:31,707 --> 01:15:34,175
I'll never allow it!

467
01:15:34,276 --> 01:15:38,696
Try to see sense.
Please, if you want me to be happy...

468
01:15:38,697 --> 01:15:42,862
You can't turn him in.
You can't do this to your little girl.

469
01:15:43,888 --> 01:15:46,244
He's a good man...

470
01:15:46,245 --> 01:15:50,197
When we're married in Mexico,
he'll change, you'll see.

471
01:15:55,558 --> 01:15:59,444
Very well.
I'll try to please you.

472
01:15:59,445 --> 01:16:03,123
I mean I'll think about it before
I make a decision.

473
01:16:03,124 --> 01:16:07,406
Let me sleep on it.
Goodnight, dear.

474
01:16:07,407 --> 01:16:11,416
We'll discuss this tomorrow.
I'm only being honest with you.

475
01:16:11,617 --> 01:16:15,717
Perhaps too much so.
Goodnight, sleep well.

476
01:16:15,818 --> 01:16:17,741
Goodnight.

477
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,147
Come in.

478
01:16:27,248 --> 01:16:29,469
I have to talk to you.

479
01:16:30,098 --> 01:16:33,607
It's about my father.
He's scared of everyone...

480
01:16:34,671 --> 01:16:37,416
He wants to hand you over
to the Sheriff.

481
01:16:38,576 --> 01:16:41,157
I did everything I could to stop him.

482
01:16:41,158 --> 01:16:44,673
When a man is so taken by fear...

483
01:16:45,085 --> 01:16:49,943
There's nothing you can do.
I have no choice, I must leave tonight...

484
01:16:49,944 --> 01:16:53,861
Before he does something foolish.
You'll go to Mexico with the gold...

485
01:16:54,311 --> 01:16:57,214
And I'll join you as soon as I can.

486
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:06,438
- I'll marry you, if you still want me?
- How can you say that?

487
01:17:07,216 --> 01:17:10,044
If I have to,
I'll wait for you till I die.

488
01:17:19,953 --> 01:17:22,868
- Good luck.
- You too.

489
01:17:24,763 --> 01:17:26,858
We'll meet again soon.

490
01:18:32,068 --> 01:18:34,873
A real masterpiece!

491
01:18:36,377 --> 01:18:39,204
I knew you'd fall for it.

492
01:18:41,487 --> 01:18:44,744
You'll never find me in Mexico...

493
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:48,397
Because I'll never go there!

494
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:14,365
Get off your horse.

495
01:19:22,253 --> 01:19:25,427
Take his gun.
He's a very dangerous man.

496
01:19:25,528 --> 01:19:28,351
We finally caught you!

497
01:19:29,367 --> 01:19:32,562
A $10,000 bounty is always useful.

498
01:19:42,563 --> 01:19:44,753
Stop!
Let him go.

499
01:19:44,854 --> 01:19:47,287
You've done a good job.

500
01:19:48,106 --> 01:19:52,480
- Tie him up, we'll take him in.
- Why trouble yourself, Sheriff?

501
01:19:53,061 --> 01:19:55,432
We're better off hanging him now.

502
01:19:55,433 --> 01:19:58,920
We'll still collect the bounty
if he's dead or alive.

503
01:19:59,021 --> 01:20:01,314
That wasn't the deal.

504
01:20:06,516 --> 01:20:11,626
You've earned the bounty,
but I'll answer for this man's life...

505
01:20:11,727 --> 01:20:15,891
- And I'll bring him in alive.
- You got me because someone turned me in.

506
01:20:15,892 --> 01:20:18,407
It sounds like the gentleman's
complaining...

507
01:20:18,408 --> 01:20:22,949
- Let's just hang him now.
- Don't you lay a finger on him...

508
01:20:24,263 --> 01:20:27,718
It's up to the courts to decide.

509
01:20:32,417 --> 01:20:38,005
- You'll all hang for this!
- Listen, redskin, I've had enough of you.

510
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:43,478
You know what?
I think we should get rid of him as well...

511
01:20:43,479 --> 01:20:46,844
Then we'll say Holy Ghost killed him.

512
01:20:48,118 --> 01:20:50,878
Let's find a nice tree.

513
01:21:01,841 --> 01:21:03,982
Before they hang me,
listen to me...

514
01:21:03,983 --> 01:21:06,809
I didn't kill your sister,
it was two gold prospectors.

515
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:11,136
- This isn't the time to discuss it.
- I'm telling you I didn't kill her.

516
01:21:11,137 --> 01:21:14,239
We'll talk about this later.
Either way, I don't believe you.

517
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:18,221
You make me laugh!
There won't be another time, Sheriff...

518
01:21:18,222 --> 01:21:20,804
Soon, you'll both be dead.

519
01:21:21,005 --> 01:21:22,888
Throw down your guns.

520
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:27,982
What are you waiting for?
One wrong move and I'll kill you!

521
01:21:30,806 --> 01:21:33,556
You made it just in time, Consuelo.

522
01:21:34,165 --> 01:21:35,814
Cut the rope.

523
01:21:36,743 --> 01:21:40,260
I was sure my father would do this,
that's why I followed you.

524
01:21:40,261 --> 01:21:45,264
He was thinking of you.
It wasn't his fault, it was my past!

525
01:21:59,241 --> 01:22:01,813
It wasn't meant to be.

526
01:23:47,371 --> 01:23:50,375
Murderer!
You killed her with your own hands!

527
01:23:51,252 --> 01:23:54,118
She's dead because of you.

528
01:24:04,046 --> 01:24:06,055
My little girl.

529
01:24:08,334 --> 01:24:10,220
Why?

530
01:24:13,906 --> 01:24:16,391
How is it possible?

531
01:24:29,735 --> 01:24:33,670
- You turned me in, and you killed her!
- Yes, it's true, I turned you in!

532
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:39,136
- You betrayed your only real friend.
- Yes, I betrayed you...

533
01:24:39,698 --> 01:24:45,939
Because I didn't want my daughter
marrying a worm like you!

534
01:24:47,537 --> 01:24:49,848
It wasn't about the gold.

535
01:25:11,043 --> 01:25:14,230
It isn't true,
I didn't turn you in...

536
01:25:15,150 --> 01:25:18,453
No...
But if I hadn't said that...

537
01:25:19,126 --> 01:25:22,134
You'd never have killed me.

538
01:25:23,379 --> 01:25:25,825
Consuelo was right...

539
01:25:25,926 --> 01:25:30,275
She was right,
you'd never have killed me.

540
01:25:31,489 --> 01:25:36,518
But I couldn't outlive my own daughter.

541
01:25:36,519 --> 01:25:39,887
I had to die...

542
01:26:03,443 --> 01:26:07,828
Why did they call me Holy Ghost?
Why?

543
01:26:08,282 --> 01:26:10,010
Why?

544
01:27:36,737 --> 01:27:39,215
Now you have to listen to me...

545
01:27:39,705 --> 01:27:41,935
I didn't kill your sister.

546
01:27:41,936 --> 01:27:46,583
I was passing your reserve,
when I saw her riding through the canyon...

547
01:27:46,584 --> 01:27:50,054
I could see two gold prospectors
watching her...

548
01:28:05,576 --> 01:28:10,182
I knew what they were up to and I tried
to catch up with them to defend her.

549
01:28:58,405 --> 01:29:00,899
She was frightened...

550
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:05,560
And when she saw me she thought
I also wanted to rape her.

551
01:29:12,781 --> 01:29:15,008
She took her own life.

552
01:29:41,102 --> 01:29:43,724
I had no other choice.

553
01:29:43,725 --> 01:29:46,796
You would never have believed me.

554
01:29:48,497 --> 01:29:52,337
You've never believed me.
My pistol is loaded...

555
01:29:53,788 --> 01:29:56,490
If you still don't believe me...

556
01:29:58,638 --> 01:30:00,745
You can kill me.

557
01:30:54,225 --> 01:30:56,479
