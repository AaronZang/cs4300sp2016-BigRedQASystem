this moment forever.

1531
01:25:02,064 --> 01:25:05,099
That was why I think Ross never
told them how sick he was.

1532
01:25:05,101 --> 01:25:08,335
He didn't want to ruin any more
of their days than he had to.

1533
01:25:08,337 --> 01:25:09,903
I'll take both dogs, too.

1534
01:25:09,905 --> 01:25:12,372
Oh, you will?

1535
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:22,249
Can you tell him
to stop filming?

1536
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:23,951
Yeah.

1537
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:32,860
Hi... You have to stop filming.

1538
01:25:32,862 --> 01:25:34,928
[SETH] What?
- You need to stop filming.

1539
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:36,563
- Why?

1540
01:25:36,565 --> 01:25:39,233
The light is amazing right now.
- Yeah, you have to stop.

1541
01:25:39,235 --> 01:25:41,235
Can you just stop please?

1542
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,848
[ROSS]
I don't think I can stand.

1543
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:03,023
You know, this is my favorite
place in the entire world.

1544
01:26:03,025 --> 01:26:08,729
Better than the Grand Canyon,
Vegas or Niagara Falls.

1545
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:16,236
[CARLY] I don't think there's
anything better than just...

1546
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:21,675
being home...
with your family, you know?

1547
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:24,912
I haven't had that
in a lot of years.

1548
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,248
[ROSS] Where are they?

1549
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:34,588
[CARLY] They're all dead.

1550
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:39,159
[ROSS] What happened?

1551
01:26:41,563 --> 01:26:47,501
[CARLY] My dad killed my mom
and my sister and himself.

1552
01:26:48,836 --> 01:26:51,672
[ROSS] Jesus Christ,
Carly I'm so sorry.

1553
01:26:51,674 --> 01:26:55,742
[CARLY]
He tried to kill me too but...

1554
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:58,879
I ran away.

1555
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:02,216
[ROSS] How old were you?

1556
01:27:02,218 --> 01:27:05,886
[CARLY EXHALES] I was 13.

1557
01:27:05,888 --> 01:27:08,555
My sister was 15.

1558
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:12,392
[ROSS] Well you are part of the
family now, Mrs. Patterson.

1559
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:15,729
So they're your family too.

1560
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:25,205
I'm really tired.

1561
01:27:25,207 --> 01:27:26,340
I should get home and rest.

1562
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:33,680
[SETH NARRATING] This was the last
shot I got of Ross on camera.

1563
01:27:33,682 --> 01:27:37,017
In the end, the stem cell
treatment didn't work.

1564
01:27:37,019 --> 01:27:40,020
I wanted to turn his death
into something else.

1565
01:27:40,022 --> 01:27:43,023
A work of art,
an experiment in cinema,

1566
01:27:43,025 --> 01:27:44,658
a consolation.

1567
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:47,527
Instead...
it became this artifact.

1568
01:27:47,529 --> 01:27:49,196
And I'm still
digging through it,

1569
01:27:49,198 --> 01:27:51,031
trying to find my brother...

1570
01:27:51,033 --> 01:27:53,200
trying to find myself.

1571
01:27:53,202 --> 01:27:58,138
