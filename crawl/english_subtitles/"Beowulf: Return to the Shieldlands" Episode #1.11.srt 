people to attack Herot.

3

Beowulf has told your
mother of Abrecan's betrayal.

She's about to ride to Bregan.

- Let me take your place.
- Step aside!

won't harm her.

I have a proposition for you
from Abrecan, Bregan's Thane.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,000
Soon 200 Wulfing
warriors will be ashore.

They won't just plunder, they'll kill.

you'll relinquish your claim

Shieldlands and Thane of Herot.

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,320
I would never do that to my son.

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,720
Of course, your son. He was the one
who laid the false blame on the Varni

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,600
even though he knew it was
I who moved against you.

16

- But you're not. And Herot needs you.

We'll scout the way first and
then the army will follow.

I was there when he washed the

- Enough!

Do you think that's enough?

494
00:40:51,596 --> 00:40:53,556
You betrayed me.

495
00:40:55,236 --> 00:40:57,236
You betrayed your people.

496
00:40:59,876 --> 00:41:03,796
You may fight with them if you
wish, but... you will never lead.

497
00:41:06,116 --> 00:41:08,116
You're not my son.

498
00:41:20,036 --> 00:41:21,516
(YELLING)

499
00:41:26,036 --> 00:41:27,396
Advance!

500
00:41:28,076 --> 00:41:29,676
(YELLING)

501
00:41:54,236 --> 00:41:56,236
Let's make camp here.

502
00:41:57,596 --> 00:41:59,316
Rest.

503
00:42:00,516 --> 00:42:02,516
We'll attack at first light.

504
00:42:04,636 --> 00:42:06,636
And tomorrow...

505
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:09,916
Herot is ours.

506
00:42:16,676 --> 00:42:18,528
And tomorrow... you will hunt

507
00:42:18,553 --> 00:42:20,660
down Beowulf and avenge Jogan.

508
00:42:21,996 --> 00:42:23,996
Jogan was my brother.

509
00:42:25,356 --> 00:42:27,516
And Beowulf will die by my blade.

510
00:42:28,636 --> 00:42:30,636
I swear it.

511
00:42:31,796 --> 00:42:35,956
On the bones of the
restless dead, I swear it.

512
00:42:37,196 --> 00:42:42,356
His Thane, Herot, everyone
and everything in it.

513
00:42:43,636 --> 00:42:46,276
All that he holds precious to him...

514
00:42:47,876 --> 00:42:49,876
shall burn.

515
00:42:54,036 --> 00:42:57,836
We're not fighting today for
the iron they smelt in the pits.

516
00:42:59,236 --> 00:43:01,716
We're not fighting for
a Thane or a Jarl.

517
00:43:03,196 --> 00:43:06,436
We're not fighting for the gold
on the walls in Rheda's hall.

518
00:43:09,076 --> 00:43:11,076
We're fighting for family.

519
00:43:11,116 --> 00:43:13,116
We're fighting for friends.

520
00:43:13,156 --> 00:43:15,156
Come on!

521
00:43:16,396 --> 00:43:18,396
For those we care for.

522
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,956
For those old piece
of dirt we call home.

523
00:43:23,636 --> 00:43:25,396
For Herot!

524
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,436
(YELLING)

525
00:43:27,906 --> 00:43:32,867
