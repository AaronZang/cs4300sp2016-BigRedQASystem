2
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,843
It is cold.

3
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,911
As the saying goes,

4
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:26,015
it's best to be on time
when good mate-tea is being served.

5
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,955
You're done for, my dog.

6
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,859
You don't have many moons left.

7
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,027
What a good mother this hen is!

8
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,538
She doesn't eat at all!

9
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:05,537
Just picks the grains for her chicks!

10
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,940
We need to collect the bridge toll.

11
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,012
Let's see if we can make 2 pesos?

12
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,299
Hello, my friends!

13
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,317
- Abel, can we pay on the way back?
- Will you be back tonight?

14
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,174
- If my waters break, there'll be a flood!
- Do you think you'll give birth so fast?

15
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,077
You know me, I'm quick.

16
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,208
Good luck, then!

17
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,620
I'm like a washing machine,
any woman can push my buttons.

18
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,186
- She cut her hair?
- Who?

19
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,361
- Juana.
- That was Juana?

20
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,828
She cut her hair.

21
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,100
How are you, Papa?

22
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,038
That dog's completely toothless.

23
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,382
- Juana got one ugly hair cut!
- More chopped than cut!

24
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,781
It doesn't suit her.

25
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,673
There are no cars today.

26
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,661
Who's that?

27
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,010
Hello, Cachito!

28
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:30,252
- How's the world? Upside down again?
- Apparently so!

29
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:45,792
I can't remember, did he pay in advance?

30
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,102
Maybe, he usually does.

31
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,818
Hi, how are you?

32
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,187
Perfect! And you?

33
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,486
Do you want a push?

34
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,916
At least we made a few meters!

35
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:35,566
- I believe it will start now.
- Really?

36
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,661
Together now.

37
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:21,078
How mysterious,
there's another world down there.

38
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,954
The world spins,
but they're always below us.

39
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:30,625
When the sun is setting here,
it's rising on the other side.

40
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,160
Imagine there's a tunnel
all the way through.

41
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,635
You'd have to dig a million meters
to come out on the other side.

42
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,107
- You could fall right through.
- Or break your back!

43
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,605
There's water in the center of the Earth.
It comes out when you dig!

44
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,707
Really? Who knows?

45
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,319
Maybe it's time to go to bed.

46
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:03,991
It's China's turn to run the planet.

47
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,502
Close the gate!

48
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:08,091
- Are you waiting for the rain?
- Yes.

49
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,753
What else can we do?

50
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,924
- Hail seems more likely.
- Really?

51
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:17,423
There was a hailstorm in the capital.

52
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,905
- You don't follow the news?
- No, we don't have a radio.

53
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:24,670
The hail in the capital
was as big as nandu eggs.

54
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:33,579
- I'm leaving before the storm comes.
- Okay, goodbye.

55
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:35,586
You can have this dog as a present.

56
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,954
Come on girl, let's go to town.

57
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,690
Stop screaming like a woman.

58
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,610
That little dog will see
more of the world than we ever did.

59
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:14,053
I have nothing against women screaming.

60
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,010
Shut up!

61
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,765
Now I'll get you.

62
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,024
Be careful. It's hot!

63
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:36,303
Good morning, big noses!

64
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,802
How are you today?

65
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,445
I offer you my hand.

66
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,084
Hello, friends! How are you?

67
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,894
Hello, Rosita!

68
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,291
Hello!

69
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,564
Rosa! Maria!

70
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,193
Blanca! Tita!

71
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,333
Lola! Bolita!

72
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,067
Nieve!
How are you!

73
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,430
Done!

74
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,017
Down, girl! Down you go!

75
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,576
How are you doing down there?

76
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,750
I just lost my shoe.

77
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,411
Let me try one.

78
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:18,581
Take a small plate for the leaves.

79
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:33,554
Look how beautiful Lake Baikal is!

80
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:44,799
- I'd like to be water in my next life.
- Water?

81
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:51,271
I don't want to be a cat or dog,
sometimes people treat them bad.

82
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:55,575
Other animals get eaten,
hunted, or put in the zoo.

83
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:08,619
- Why not a human being?
- No! I'd prefer to be water!

84
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:10,467
You are not listening
to my stories today!

85
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:33,693
Imagine he loves you and you love him,

86
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:37,065
but neither of you know.

87
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:39,038
What would you do?

88
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:42,136
Wouldn't we have to meet first?

89
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:44,977
No, you didn't understand.

90
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:50,976
You already know each other,
but only as friends.

91
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,887
I don't get you.

92
00:44:56,694 --> 00:45:00,460
The truth is: I love this boy at school,

93
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:04,729
but he doesn't know it yet.

94
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:08,301
What would you do?

95
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:24,218
- Be good!
- Goodbye!

96
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:29,752
Such a short visit again.

97
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:21,149
The moon is not yet as full as the sun.

98
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:28,080
- I thought there was no moon tonight.
- But there is.

99
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:33,123
It's going to be cold.

100
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:35,393
I think it's going to be cold.

101
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:41,464
It's good to cuddle up to your woman.

102
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:44,372
I just pile on the blankets.

103
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,330
Open the gate!

104
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:23,204
I've never seen
a Chinese person in my life.

105
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,505
All I know about the Chinese
is that they are similar to us,

106
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:29,171
but they speak fast
and you can't understand anything.

107
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:31,744
I admire them because they're so clever.

108
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:36,881
There are so many of them,
they must be very intelligent.

109
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,152
Elephant!

110
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:00,629
Are you afraid? Don't be.

111
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:06,998
They're walking along the river.

112
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:13,976
- Who's over there again?
- Elephants.

113
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,245
They're going to the water.

114
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:56,046
I'm trying to keep my place clean,

115
01:00:56,085 --> 01:01:00,181
but those elephants
are always making a mess here!

116
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:04,648
One day they'll step inside my shop!

117
01:01:05,305 --> 01:01:11,247
