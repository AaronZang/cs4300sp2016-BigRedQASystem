2
00:46:56,922 --> 00:47:01,791
His dad's had a stroke.
Speech gone, paralysed. He might die.

3
00:47:01,882 --> 00:47:03,281
Good.

4
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:08,152
If you could sign this. It states that you
won't make a claim for any inheritance.

5
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,915
There you go. Thanks, Mum.

6
00:47:12,442 --> 00:47:15,593
We're celebrating.
We've just got engaged.

7
00:47:15,682 --> 00:47:17,798
Pass the word round.

8
00:47:17,882 --> 00:47:21,431
Wedding fever. Clever little bastard.

9
00:47:21,522 --> 00:47:24,161
(Vince) 'I'll bet you
he gets that job instead of me.

10
00:47:24,242 --> 00:47:28,030
'Marriage means promotion guaranteed
and he knows it.'

11
00:47:28,122 --> 00:47:31,159
I'd look at you, 14 years old,
hormones all over,

12
00:47:31,242 --> 00:47:33,802
you'd have shagged a letter box.
But not him

13
00:47:33,882 --> 00:47:37,841
(Stuart) Nope. You've got to fancy him.

14
00:47:38,962 --> 00:47:41,522
Love can fuck off.

15
00:47:41,602 --> 00:47:45,038
If you fancy him, there's blood,
there's a hard-on.

16
00:47:45,122 --> 00:47:48,000
'Lf you just love him, no blood.'

17
00:47:53,482 --> 00:47:57,839
You know what Phil used to say? That
you were saving me till your old age.

18
00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:01,675
So the day I shag you, I'm old.

19
00:48:31,082 --> 00:48:33,232
I'd better warn you...

20
00:48:33,322 --> 00:48:35,278
I'm on this medication.

21
00:48:37,242 --> 00:48:39,710
- I'm taking these pills.
- What for?

22
00:48:40,802 --> 00:48:43,191
- Me stomach.
- That's all right.

23
00:48:43,282 --> 00:48:45,238
Yeah... (Gasping)

24
00:48:46,362 --> 00:48:48,318
But the thing is...

25
00:48:48,402 --> 00:48:50,358
these pills...

26
00:48:50,442 --> 00:48:52,398
(Groans) Oh, God...

27
00:48:53,642 --> 00:48:55,598
They sort of...

28
00:48:57,562 --> 00:48:59,518
Jesus... They do things to me.

29
00:49:01,882 --> 00:49:04,077
They make me... They make me spunk...

30
00:49:05,162 --> 00:49:07,118
They make me spunk...

31
00:49:07,202 --> 00:49:09,158
(Gasping) Me spunk...

32
00:49:15,122 --> 00:49:17,078
Orange.

33
00:49:20,842 --> 00:49:23,879
I'll just go give 'em a brush,
I had garlic bread.

34
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:29,035
- Shall I go through?
- Oh, living room on the left,

35
00:49:29,122 --> 00:49:31,636
bedroom on the right.

36
00:49:31,722 --> 00:49:33,678
Don't be long.

37
00:49:39,762 --> 00:49:41,718
(Retches)

38
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:46,638
(Retches)

39
00:49:48,522 --> 00:49:51,082
- You all right?
- Oh, fine, thanks.

40
00:49:51,962 --> 00:49:55,159
Can't stand toothbrushes. Sorry.

41
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,597
(Retches) Horrible things.

42
00:49:59,362 --> 00:50:01,717
Oh, my God, is that the time?

43
00:50:07,762 --> 00:50:10,322
- I'd better go.
- In a minute.

44
00:50:16,042 --> 00:50:17,998
Really, I'd better go.

45
00:50:18,082 --> 00:50:20,596
Oh, come on.

46
00:50:20,682 --> 00:50:22,035
(Horn honks)

47
00:50:22,122 --> 00:50:25,194
It's three in the morning!
The entire street wakes up.

48
00:50:25,282 --> 00:50:28,035
- Is that it?
- It was so loud!

49
00:50:28,122 --> 00:50:29,999
And that's the punch line?

50
00:50:30,082 --> 00:50:32,835
- That is pathetic.
- It was brilliant!

51
00:50:32,922 --> 00:50:37,200
All these people looking out
and I'm there snogging this bloke!

52
00:50:37,282 --> 00:50:40,115
- That's not a story.
- He gets Toothbrush Man

53
00:50:40,202 --> 00:50:43,797
I get a man with spunk like a Tellytubby
and you haven't even started.

54
00:50:43,882 --> 00:50:47,477
- So young.
- He gave me his phone number.

55
00:50:47,562 --> 00:50:51,919
D'you think I should phone him
or should I wait for him to phone me?

56
00:50:52,002 --> 00:50:53,799
How should I know?

57
00:50:53,882 --> 00:50:57,318
- He's never phoned anyone.
- You know how it works.

58
00:50:57,402 --> 00:51:00,155
- Problem page, "Dear Stuart..."
- Shut up.

59
00:51:00,242 --> 00:51:02,676
Wise old man, that's you.

60
00:51:02,762 --> 00:51:06,038
- You're so not funny.
- Look, he's pissed off.

61
00:51:06,122 --> 00:51:08,192
Look, he's really pissed off!

62
00:51:08,282 --> 00:51:11,194
- Now that's funny. Nice one.
- (Both laugh)

63
00:51:11,282 --> 00:51:13,512
Look at his face!

64
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,880
(Laughter)

65
00:51:19,962 --> 00:51:22,192
- Me too.
- Good luck then.

66
00:51:22,282 --> 00:51:25,718
And you. May the best "man"...
and all that.

67
00:51:28,722 --> 00:51:30,633
Guess what he's done.

68
00:51:30,722 --> 00:51:34,431
He's gone and bought shares
in the company! 300 quids' worth!

69
00:51:34,522 --> 00:51:38,515
And he just happened to tell
that Mrs Fletcher - in passing.

70
00:51:38,602 --> 00:51:43,198
- He's fighting dirty, Vince.
- I don't care. I'm gonna get that job.

71
00:51:43,282 --> 00:51:45,637
(Bernard) Don't you know the colour?

72
00:51:45,722 --> 00:51:48,839
(Hazel) It's got a Virgin Mary
on the dashboard.

73
00:51:48,922 --> 00:51:51,277
If Vince finds out he'll murder you.

74
00:51:51,362 --> 00:51:54,115
We need this promotion
more than he does.

75
00:51:54,202 --> 00:51:57,160
If you spent more money on rent
and less on rent boys...

76
00:51:57,242 --> 00:51:59,392
That's the one!

77
00:51:59,482 --> 00:52:02,042
Bless the Catholic boy.

78
00:52:02,122 --> 00:52:03,874
Ready?

79
00:52:04,962 --> 00:52:07,078
(Alarm honking)

80
00:52:08,282 --> 00:52:10,238
- Graham?
- Mm?

81
00:52:10,322 --> 00:52:12,790
It's your car, the alarm's gone off.

82
00:52:13,882 --> 00:52:16,191
- (Alarm honking)
- Here he is!

83
00:52:20,842 --> 00:52:23,197
- Did you get it?
- Shit and buggery!

84
00:52:23,282 --> 00:52:26,877
(Hazel) What happened?
(Bernard) I don't know.

85
00:52:26,962 --> 00:52:29,795
He's going to do it again! Give it here!

86
00:52:29,882 --> 00:52:32,521
- (Alarm beeps)
- Yes!

87
00:52:40,002 --> 00:52:42,311
If this doesn't work, leg it.

88
00:52:50,282 --> 00:52:53,001
- Nice work, Mrs Peel.
- Thank you, Steed.

89
00:52:55,162 --> 00:52:56,914
Stage two.

90
00:52:57,002 --> 00:53:00,153
- There's nothing about websites.
- Exactly!

91
00:53:00,242 --> 00:53:04,793
If they upgraded their streaming media
they could whip Tesco's.

92
00:53:04,882 --> 00:53:08,841
I'm only head of personnel,
you should see the duty manager.

93
00:53:08,922 --> 00:53:13,074
- Two minutes, that's all I need.
...the hypermarket at 17%...

94
00:53:13,162 --> 00:53:18,190
Trolleys everywhere. If we'd crashed -
there could've been children!

95
00:53:18,282 --> 00:53:20,796
I'm very sorry, I can only apologise,

96
00:53:20,882 --> 00:53:22,873
- Mrs...?
- Peel.

97
00:53:22,962 --> 00:53:24,873
I'll have a word with the staff...

98
00:53:27,642 --> 00:53:30,395
Thank you for alerting me
to the problem.

99
00:53:30,482 --> 00:53:35,112
Well, I won't take it further
but my husband's very upset.

100
00:53:35,202 --> 00:53:37,352
- Aren't you, Bernard?
- Oh, aye.

101
00:53:45,242 --> 00:53:49,315
Off you go, Magda wants the porn back.
She's having a party.

102
00:53:50,402 --> 00:53:53,553
You both did very well
but there's only one job,

103
00:53:53,642 --> 00:53:57,112
- it's a shame you can't both succeed.
- Absolutely.

104
00:53:57,202 --> 00:53:59,318
Yeah, pity. I'd better, erm...

105
00:54:06,082 --> 00:54:08,960
You got it then? Well?

106
00:54:11,522 --> 00:54:13,478
He's got it!

107
00:54:13,562 --> 00:54:14,995
(Both yelling excitedly)

108
00:54:21,522 --> 00:54:24,832
In five years you'll be manager -
how boring is that?

109
00:54:24,922 --> 00:54:27,436
- Oi!
- (Stuart) We should celebrate.

110
00:54:27,522 --> 00:54:30,514
Hey, Nathan,
have you ever done a threesome?

111
00:54:30,602 --> 00:54:34,834
No. I got asked by this couple in London
but they were both ugly.

112
00:54:34,922 --> 00:54:37,117
D'you fancy giving it a go?

113
00:54:37,202 --> 00:54:38,555
Yeah.

114
00:54:39,722 --> 00:54:42,156
Right, then, off we go. Us three.

115
00:54:42,242 --> 00:54:46,201
- In your dreams.
- You'd do it? Part of your education.

116
00:54:47,122 --> 00:54:49,272
- I don't mind.
- Would you hell.

117
00:54:49,362 --> 00:54:52,593
- I'm up for anything.
- The perfect threesome.

118
00:54:52,682 --> 00:54:56,516
- I'd rather have a wank.
- You, me and Nathan.

119
00:54:56,602 --> 00:55:00,800
(Laughs) That'd be so brilliant!

120
00:55:00,882 --> 00:55:03,715
I'd just go for it, yeah?

121
00:55:04,762 --> 00:55:08,721
See, that's the problem with Vince.
He doesn't want sex...

122
00:55:08,802 --> 00:55:10,758
he wants a wife!

123
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:15,751
Listen, whoever ends up with me,
he's a very lucky man.

124
00:55:15,842 --> 00:55:17,639
God help him.

125
00:55:17,722 --> 00:55:21,795
- What's all this in aid of?
- You're not a good catch, are you?

126
00:55:21,882 --> 00:55:25,238
- I suppose you are?
- No one's gonna catch me.

127
00:55:29,442 --> 00:55:32,275
So, er, how many men
have you had now?

128
00:55:33,042 --> 00:55:34,839
Dunno. About... seven?

129
00:55:34,922 --> 00:55:39,074
- Seven. I must've had about 2,007.
- Yeah?

130
00:55:40,842 --> 00:55:43,197
That means I've got 2,000 to go.

131
00:55:43,282 --> 00:55:45,477
How many have you got left?

132
00:55:50,602 --> 00:55:52,354
(School bell)

133
00:55:53,442 --> 00:55:56,832
- Oi, Nathan, is it your birthday?
- What if it is?

134
00:55:56,922 --> 00:55:59,914
- You havin' a party?
- None of your business.

135
00:56:00,002 --> 00:56:03,312
Is it on Canal Street
with all your queer friends?

136
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:06,519
I've seen him, it's where he goes.
Queer Street.

137
00:56:06,602 --> 00:56:10,675
He's been watchin' us in the showers.
Tossin' himself off.

138
00:56:10,762 --> 00:56:13,117
I'd sooner toss myself off a cliff.

139
00:56:13,202 --> 00:56:16,797
Oh, you want some of this?
Come on AIDS boy, suck me off.

140
00:56:16,882 --> 00:56:20,079
- He's got a stiffy.
- You'd know all about that.

141
00:56:20,162 --> 00:56:24,121
He fancies me. Sir, Nathan Maloney
fancies me! Tell him!

142
00:56:24,202 --> 00:56:28,559
- He's a poof, sir. A queer.
- That's a fact, sir. Keeps on lookin'.

143
00:56:28,642 --> 00:56:31,873
He fancies us. Look in his bag,
he's got lipstick.

144
00:56:31,962 --> 00:56:35,193
- Piss off!
- Nathan, enough of that language.

145
00:56:35,282 --> 00:56:37,477
Me? What about them?

146
00:56:37,562 --> 00:56:39,518
I said, that's enough!

147
00:56:41,682 --> 00:56:43,638
He's a faggot, man.

148
00:56:44,722 --> 00:56:46,678
Queer.

149
00:56:51,242 --> 00:56:55,155
(Janice) He sent you a card.
He never remembers my birthday.

150
00:56:55,242 --> 00:56:58,200
Is that all I get, a card?
Off my own father?

151
00:56:58,282 --> 00:57:00,238
I'll give him a ring tomorrow.

152
00:57:00,322 --> 00:57:03,155
He might have put some money
in your bank account.

153
00:57:03,242 --> 00:57:05,198
Bet he hasn't though.

154
00:57:05,282 --> 00:57:08,274
- Hiya!
- Happy birthday. That's from us.

155
00:57:08,362 --> 00:57:13,595
You've got to say 18 - if they find out
I'm 16 they'll chuck us out.

156
00:57:13,682 --> 00:57:16,037
It's Nathan's night - someone has to lie.

157
00:57:16,122 --> 00:57:18,352
Hey, there's food. I'm starving.

158
00:57:18,442 --> 00:57:22,151
I bet it's all meat.
I was tricked into a Twiglet yesterday.

159
00:57:22,242 --> 00:57:24,836
You don't have to stand there all night.

160
00:57:29,042 --> 00:57:33,160
Amaretto, this'll put us in the mood.
I found it in my clothes.

161
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:36,393
Go and enjoy yourselves,
I'll be baby-sitting.

162
00:57:36,482 --> 00:57:39,792
Bring him, it's a kid's party -
jelly and ice cream.

163
00:57:39,882 --> 00:57:43,795
Pass the parcel in Via Fossa -
good few packages in there.

164
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:47,476
- Want one?
- I'm not drinking.

165
00:57:47,562 --> 00:57:52,113
Sod it, let's not go. Take him back
to the lesbians and go to Poptastic.

166
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:54,352
- (Doorbell)
- That's for me.

167
00:57:54,442 --> 00:57:57,434
Vincent Tyler's taking charge -
deputy manager.

168
00:57:57,522 --> 00:58:00,434
He's power mad.
He's blockaded the SuperNoodles.

169
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:02,478
It's the most boring job in the world.

170
00:58:03,802 --> 00:58:07,795
- Somebody call an ambulance?
- It's me. I've got the bottle.

171
00:58:07,882 --> 00:58:10,555
I only took 'em ten minutes ago.

172
00:58:10,642 --> 00:58:15,113
- I had a Kit Kat, does that count?
- Right, let's get you seen to.

173
00:58:15,202 --> 00:58:17,557
- You walking all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

174
00:58:18,642 --> 00:58:22,430
- What you doing?
- I'm a twat, I'm sorry. I'll be fine.

175
00:58:22,522 --> 00:58:25,400
- (Woman) You coming with him?
- What's this?

176
00:58:25,482 --> 00:58:28,713
Just sod off, go to the party.
I'm sorry, OK?

177
00:58:28,802 --> 00:58:31,555
- He's gone and done it again.
- You twat!

178
00:58:31,642 --> 00:58:33,712
- I know!
- Are you coming?

179
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:36,396
Like I've got a choice.

180
00:58:45,002 --> 00:58:47,277
Stupid fucking cunt.

181
00:58:48,362 --> 00:58:50,318
(Crying)

182
00:58:53,322 --> 00:58:55,074
Where we going?

183
00:58:57,442 --> 00:58:59,876
Let's tell his mother the good news.

184
00:59:01,282 --> 00:59:03,238
Hiya! I'm here.

185
00:59:03,322 --> 00:59:06,837
- Hello, Bernie.
- Sorry, the others got held up.

186
00:59:06,922 --> 00:59:10,471
My fault, I was shaving me back
and they all joined in.

187
00:59:10,562 --> 00:59:12,917
And Alexander got called into work.

188
00:59:13,002 --> 00:59:17,120
Here you go - didn't have time to wrap it
but happy birthday.

189
00:59:17,202 --> 00:59:19,238
Thanks. Was Stuart there?

190
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:21,597
I think so. Any money behind the bar?

191
00:59:21,682 --> 00:59:26,676
Just say you're with Nathan's party.
Only wines and beers, though.

192
00:59:26,762 --> 00:59:28,753
I've got a watch.

193
00:59:29,522 --> 00:59:31,797
- Hiya!
- Who's that?

194
00:59:31,882 --> 00:59:33,873
Stuart's secretary.

195
00:59:33,962 --> 00:59:37,671
Oh, right. Sends his secretary,
that's nice of him.

196
00:59:37,762 --> 00:59:40,117
Maybe he'll appear by satellite link.

197
00:59:44,802 --> 00:59:48,511
- Hiya. Is Stuart coming?
- I'd be the last to know.

198
00:59:48,602 --> 00:59:52,038
If it isn't about his dry-cleaning
he tells me sod all.

199
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:54,682
Yeah, but d'you think he's gonna come?

200
00:59:54,762 --> 00:59:57,515
Not if he's found something better, no.

201
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,718
You don't even like him!

202
01:00:05,162 --> 01:00:07,118
Don't.

203
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:11,956
Let's go home.

204
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:14,351
- Come with me.
- Does she deserve it?

205
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:19,274
- You'll make it worse.
- Does she deserve it?

206
01:00:19,362 --> 01:00:21,080
You can't!

207
01:00:21,962 --> 01:00:23,554
Watch me.

208
01:00:24,642 --> 01:00:27,998
Yeah. You'd like that.

209
01:00:29,642 --> 01:00:31,997
I've spent years watching you.

210
01:00:35,002 --> 01:00:36,401
Coward.

211
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:40,754
Coward!

212
01:00:57,882 --> 01:01:00,271
I've got a message from your son.

213
01:01:00,362 --> 01:01:04,071
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't come to my house.

214
01:01:04,162 --> 01:01:07,996
I don't think we've got anything
to say to each other.

215
01:01:08,082 --> 01:01:09,834
Just one thing.

216
01:01:11,722 --> 01:01:13,599
Bang!

217
01:01:59,202 --> 01:02:01,716
(* Geri Halliwell: Mi Chico Latino)

218
01:02:04,842 --> 01:02:08,073
Vince! Don't tell me,
Stuart hasn't bothered.

219
01:02:08,162 --> 01:02:09,515
No.

220
01:02:09,602 --> 01:02:12,958
Yes. He's upstairs.
He's just gone to Manto's.

221
01:02:13,042 --> 01:02:17,035
I was with him. He's coming back.
Er, but he was here.

222
01:02:17,122 --> 01:02:19,272
Yeah, I bet. Jimmy!

223
01:02:25,562 --> 01:02:27,917
Party face on.

224
01:02:29,882 --> 01:02:32,840
(* Shaft: Mucho Mambo)

225
01:02:36,162 --> 01:02:38,676
- You're late! Got me a present?
- No.

226
01:02:38,762 --> 01:02:40,878
Get me a mobile phone if you want.

Oh, shit.

232
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:00,994
Come back to mine.

233
01:03:02,082 --> 01:03:04,038
(Sighs)

234
01:03:05,122 --> 01:03:09,195
- I'll stay with Mum. She's worn out.
- Both come. Both come back.

235
01:03:12,882 --> 01:03:14,998
She deserved it.

236
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:19,598
I know! But tell her to fuck off!
You're always telling them to fuck off!

237
01:03:19,682 --> 01:03:21,991
- It's not enough any more.
- It is!

238
01:03:22,082 --> 01:03:26,678
You can't go and... There's people
relying on me - Mum and that house!

239
01:03:26,762 --> 01:03:31,756
I end up paying the mortgage every other
month - they don't earn tuppence!

240
01:03:31,842 --> 01:03:33,673
You're on your own.

241
01:03:33,762 --> 01:03:36,959
Suits me. You're just straight, Vince.

242
01:03:37,042 --> 01:03:40,671
You're a straight man
who fucks men, that's all.

243
01:03:53,962 --> 01:03:55,918
(Man) Night, Arnie. See ya!

244
01:04:49,762 --> 01:04:51,718
Sorry.

245
01:04:54,922 --> 01:04:57,038
(Teacher) Abbott.
(Boy) Here.

246
01:04:57,122 --> 01:04:59,477
- Baxter.
- Here.

247
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,951
- Collins.
- Here.

248
01:05:02,042 --> 01:05:03,998
- Davis.
- Here.

249
01:05:05,682 --> 01:05:07,991
Nathan, what time do you call this?

250
01:05:10,922 --> 01:05:13,994
One minute past nine, sir. Why?

251
01:05:14,082 --> 01:05:17,870
- Cos you're late, that's why!
- How was the party?

252
01:05:17,962 --> 01:05:21,921
- Did you get it up your arse?
- He probably can't sit down.

253
01:05:22,002 --> 01:05:24,470
Party full of queers. Makes me sick.

254
01:05:24,562 --> 01:05:28,396
- All right, settle down. Edgar.
- (Boy) Here.

255
01:05:28,482 --> 01:05:30,438
- Fraser.
- Here.

256
01:05:30,522 --> 01:05:32,353
- Hobbs.
- Here.

257
01:05:32,442 --> 01:05:34,273
- Johnson.
- Here.

258
01:05:34,362 --> 01:05:36,193
- Jones.
- Here.

259
01:05:36,282 --> 01:05:38,113
- Maloney.
- Queer.

260
01:05:38,202 --> 01:05:39,999
(Laughter)

261
01:05:42,402 --> 01:05:45,121
- I beg your pardon?
- I said "queer".

262
01:05:45,202 --> 01:05:48,160
- I'm aware of that.
- Oh. That's a miracle.

263
01:05:48,242 --> 01:05:51,040
Cos they say it
and you don't hear a thing.

264
01:05:51,122 --> 01:05:54,273
- I don't like your tone.
- I don't like yours.

265
01:05:54,362 --> 01:05:58,321
If you want to make something
out of this, sir, that's fine.

266
01:05:58,402 --> 01:06:00,597
Go on, send me to the headmaster.

267
01:06:00,682 --> 01:06:02,479
I'd love it.

268
01:06:02,562 --> 01:06:04,518
There's plenty I can tell him.

269
01:06:04,602 --> 01:06:08,880
I can get my mother in, she'd love it.
She'd love to meet you, sir.

270
01:06:08,962 --> 01:06:13,433
D'you wanna do that?
Go on, take it further.

271
01:06:21,522 --> 01:06:23,717
- McVerry.
- Here.

272
01:06:23,802 --> 01:06:26,077
- Mulhearn.
- Here.

273
01:06:26,162 --> 01:06:28,596
- Nicholls.
- Here.

274
01:06:48,522 --> 01:06:52,356
They were just kids.
They were running away.

275
01:06:52,442 --> 01:06:54,831
Mrs Perry never saw any kids.

276
01:06:54,922 --> 01:06:59,200
Sweethearts, I can't boil an egg,
how the fuck do you blow up a car?

277
01:06:59,282 --> 01:07:02,035
So it was a coincidence,
you being there?

278
01:07:02,122 --> 01:07:05,956
You should see my Jeep.
You can tell Mrs Perry I'm gonna sue.

279
01:07:06,042 --> 01:07:08,192
She's not keen on pressing charges.

280
01:07:08,282 --> 01:07:11,797
I think there are family things
she'd rather not talk about.

281
01:07:11,882 --> 01:07:15,921
- Oh, get her.
- It's not her decision. Criminal damage.

282
01:07:16,002 --> 01:07:17,913
We won't be letting it drop.

283
01:07:18,002 --> 01:07:23,122
Hang on, erm, I better give you my card.
It's got my mobile on it.

284
01:07:23,202 --> 01:07:28,151
I don't think I'm gonna be around
much longer, time for a change of scene.

285
01:07:29,362 --> 01:07:32,240
- Anywhere in particular?
- London.

286
01:07:32,322 --> 01:07:34,472
The clubs are fab.

287
01:07:37,842 --> 01:07:41,881
(Romey) I've got that project in Brixton,
I'm always there.

288
01:07:41,962 --> 01:07:45,079
He'll enjoy it. We'll manage.

289
01:07:47,322 --> 01:07:49,517
So what's brought all this about?

290
01:07:49,602 --> 01:07:51,718
Big fish in a small pond.

291
01:07:54,202 --> 01:07:56,193
It's so small.

292
01:07:56,282 --> 01:08:01,402
I'm friends with a sixteen-year-old boy.
It's time to leave.

293
01:08:01,482 --> 01:08:06,272
Vince could get transferred. He could
afford London - he's on a good wage.

294
01:08:06,362 --> 01:08:11,277
He'd just hold me back.
Standing there, disapproving.

295
01:08:11,362 --> 01:08:15,560
- And you love it.
- I've got things I wanna do.

296
01:08:15,642 --> 01:08:18,520
And he's just... he's not...
he's not good enough!

297
01:08:18,602 --> 01:08:22,436
Oh, you've argued again.
You two are like a married couple.

298
01:08:22,522 --> 01:08:25,241
- We're not shagging.
- That's marriage.

299
01:08:25,322 --> 01:08:27,278
Another reason to go.

300
01:08:27,362 --> 01:08:30,991
I bet he moves to London.
What's he said?

301
01:08:34,522 --> 01:08:36,478
Go on, what's he said?

302
01:08:40,802 --> 01:08:44,317
Oh, for Christ's sake,
you haven't even told him?

303
01:08:44,402 --> 01:08:46,358
(Raucous laughter)

304
01:08:46,442 --> 01:08:50,321
(Alexander) "...that's a funny bed bath,
what sort of nurse are you?"

305
01:08:50,402 --> 01:08:52,996
He says, "Nurse?
I work in the tuck shop!"

306
01:08:54,162 --> 01:08:58,280
- George Sapieka went to hospital...
- Not this one! Give up!

307
01:08:58,362 --> 01:09:01,115
* Don't you know it's true what they say

308
01:09:01,202 --> 01:09:03,352
* That life, it ain't easy

309
01:09:03,442 --> 01:09:06,479
* But your time's coming around

310
01:09:06,562 --> 01:09:08,678
* So don't you stop trying... *

311
01:09:08,762 --> 01:09:12,641
- Evening.
- Evening. Two gin and tonics, please.

312
01:09:14,562 --> 01:09:17,793
- You going out clubbing?
- Why do you wanna know?

313
01:09:17,882 --> 01:09:19,838
Just keeping tabs on my son.

314
01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:23,358
If you're going clubbing,
Nathan's going clubbing.

315
01:09:23,442 --> 01:09:27,117
His master's voice.
Don't know what he sees in you.

316
01:09:27,802 --> 01:09:29,360
Yeah, you do.

317
01:09:29,442 --> 01:09:32,912
It's not what I call a hairstyle.
And as for the walk.

318
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:35,880
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

319
01:09:36,602 --> 01:09:40,914
Still, time was Nathan thought
you were boyfriend material.

320
01:09:41,002 --> 01:09:43,721
Now you're better than that - you're God.

321
01:09:43,802 --> 01:09:46,077
What am I supposed to do about that?

322
01:09:46,162 --> 01:09:49,598
- Leave?
- Don't you dare, he'll only follow.

323
01:09:49,682 --> 01:09:52,480
And he's done enough running away.

324
01:09:52,562 --> 01:09:54,518
Thanks for the drinks.

325
01:09:54,602 --> 01:09:57,116
Pleasure.

326
01:09:57,202 --> 01:09:59,670
* But your time's coming around

327
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:01,559
* So don't you stop trying

328
01:10:01,642 --> 01:10:03,234
* Don't stop, never give up *

329
01:10:17,362 --> 01:10:19,512
Never did give you that present.

330
01:10:22,322 --> 01:10:24,961
I'll have a mobile phone.

331
01:10:26,042 --> 01:10:28,397
Hmm. I can do better than that.

332
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:42,157
(Both breathing heavily)

333
01:10:43,762 --> 01:10:46,515
- 16...
- Shut up.

334
01:10:52,282 --> 01:10:54,432
Oh, don't... don't...

335
01:10:54,522 --> 01:10:56,478
Oh, fuck...

336
01:11:08,162 --> 01:11:09,720
Sorry.

337
01:11:09,802 --> 01:11:11,554
It's OK.

338
01:11:13,082 --> 01:11:16,631
- Do you want me to finish you off?
- No, it's all right.

339
01:11:19,082 --> 01:11:22,313
Anyway, the night's still young.

340
01:11:22,402 --> 01:11:24,552
I'm really sorry.

341
01:11:35,042 --> 01:11:39,433
* I don't know what I'd do
if you ever left me

342
01:11:39,522 --> 01:11:42,275
* Tell me how would I make it

343
01:11:42,362 --> 01:11:47,038
* I don't know what I'd do
if you ever left me

344
01:11:47,122 --> 01:11:50,637
* My heart couldn't take it... *

345
01:11:50,722 --> 01:11:54,271
Nathan, I'm off home.
If you need a lift give me a ring.

346
01:11:54,362 --> 01:11:56,193
Might go to Dante's.

347
01:11:56,282 --> 01:11:59,433
- Course you will. With Stuart.
- I don't know.

348
01:11:59,522 --> 01:12:02,992
It's embarrassing
being seen with him all the time.

349
01:12:03,082 --> 01:12:05,596
Up close, he's looking dead old.

350
01:12:05,682 --> 01:12:08,480
He'd kill you for saying that!

351
01:12:08,562 --> 01:12:10,678
He wouldn't have the strength.

352
01:12:10,762 --> 01:12:13,560
Right, Dante's, quick visit?

353
01:12:13,642 --> 01:12:18,591
Ooh, I've not copped off for five weeks -
ever since I got contact lenses.

354
01:12:23,162 --> 01:12:25,995
Coming?

355
01:12:26,082 --> 01:12:28,550
Yeah. Yeah, all right. Might as well.

356
01:12:30,722 --> 01:12:32,678
Be bad.

357
01:12:36,802 --> 01:12:39,760
- What am I, charity?
- Yeah, erm...

358
01:12:39,842 --> 01:12:43,198
Me and Vince,
we were going out one night and...

359
01:12:43,282 --> 01:12:46,991
- robbed a tenner from your purse.
- You cheeky sods!

360
01:12:47,082 --> 01:12:49,960
Hang on, when were you
last short of a tenner?

361
01:12:50,922 --> 01:12:53,834
(* Urban Cookie Collective:
The Key: The Secret)

362
01:12:59,322 --> 01:13:03,110
The sad twat's wearing cheesecloth.
Is cheesecloth back?

363
01:13:03,202 --> 01:13:06,239
Never went away,
disguised itself as linen.

364
01:13:06,322 --> 01:13:09,758
Steven Polack!
He was after me last Mardi Gras!

365
01:13:09,842 --> 01:13:11,912
He tried to snog me. I'm in there.

366
01:13:21,282 --> 01:13:24,240
I should go. Big meeting tomorrow.

367
01:13:25,322 --> 01:13:28,075
I'm up early. Got to go to London.

368
01:13:30,242 --> 01:13:33,075
He's in. I hate seeing him.

369
01:13:33,162 --> 01:13:37,997
First time here he was a kid. Then
he got all muscles, then he went mad.

370
01:13:38,082 --> 01:13:40,596
He's been with that bloke five years now.

371
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:43,435
Never said a word. We nod.

372
01:13:43,522 --> 01:13:45,956
- I've had him.
- You've had 'em all.

373
01:13:46,042 --> 01:13:49,478
- Been here far too long.
- Telling me.

374
01:13:49,562 --> 01:13:51,518
Oh, God, they're all in!

375
01:13:51,602 --> 01:13:55,311
There's Colin -
I had him that last night at Flesh.

376
01:13:55,402 --> 01:13:58,678
(Laughs) Oh, God. I had that suit.

377
01:13:58,762 --> 01:14:01,674
I liked that suit. You looked good.

378
01:14:06,682 --> 01:14:08,638
Didn't half wanna shag you.

379
01:14:17,402 --> 01:14:19,870
Long time ago.

380
01:14:19,962 --> 01:14:21,918
I should go.

381
01:14:24,522 --> 01:14:26,433
But then again...

382
01:14:26,522 --> 01:14:28,478
One last fling.

383
01:14:28,562 --> 01:14:30,871
Good luck. Not that you'll need it.

384
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:37,718
(Vince laughs)

385
01:14:49,082 --> 01:14:52,631
Do you remember that little friend of his?
That girl?

386
01:14:52,722 --> 01:14:55,634
- Yeah.
- He didn't need her in the end.

387
01:14:55,722 --> 01:14:58,475
His best friend and he didn't need her.

388
01:14:58,562 --> 01:15:00,518
Clever boy.

389
01:15:05,562 --> 01:15:08,076
I'm off. London calling.

390
01:15:09,602 --> 01:15:12,036
- London?
- Yeah.

391
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:15,478
Been here far too long.

392
01:15:17,922 --> 01:15:20,231
Still, we've had a laugh.

393
01:15:21,082 --> 01:15:22,674
And the rest.

394
01:15:24,722 --> 01:15:27,555
- See you then.
- Not if I see you first.

395
01:15:27,642 --> 01:15:30,759
* I've got the key, I've got the secret

396
01:15:30,842 --> 01:15:34,278
* I've got the key to another way

397
01:15:34,362 --> 01:15:35,715
* I've got the key... *

398
01:15:36,722 --> 01:15:39,441
Fat Daniel said that
Raymondo's back in town.

399
01:15:39,522 --> 01:15:42,992
- Hm?
- Hypothermia my arse.

400
01:15:43,082 --> 01:15:45,642
I don't think he's even got a mother.

401
01:15:46,722 --> 01:15:48,917
This tea tastes like fish.

402
01:15:49,002 --> 01:15:50,833
Who's on GMTV?

403
01:15:50,922 --> 01:15:55,677
Kriss Akabusi. If I had a pound
for every time that man laughed...

404
01:15:56,762 --> 01:15:59,913
You see, I preferred it
when it was TV-AM.

405
01:16:02,882 --> 01:16:07,114
Wincey Willis.
I wonder what happened to her...

406
01:16:07,202 --> 01:16:10,114
Ooh, Treasure Hunt, Anneka Rice...

407
01:16:15,122 --> 01:16:17,158
Hello, Stuart Jones's office.

408
01:16:17,242 --> 01:16:20,393
- 'Sandra, it's Hazel.'
- I'll have to stop that.

409
01:16:20,482 --> 01:16:23,315
It's not his office.
I was gonna phone you.

410
01:16:23,402 --> 01:16:26,314
'Lt's about Vince -
tell him to keep in touch.

411
01:16:26,402 --> 01:16:28,393
'He's still got some of my CDs.'

412
01:16:28,482 --> 01:16:30,677
Oh, I bet he's gonna miss him.

413
01:16:30,762 --> 01:16:32,832
- Miss who?
- Stuart.

414
01:16:35,002 --> 01:16:36,958
Sell it.

415
01:16:39,042 --> 01:16:42,830
Sally, did you read the memo
about wasting company time?

416
01:16:42,922 --> 01:16:44,275
Sorry.

417
01:16:44,362 --> 01:16:45,875
Coffee?

418
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:47,991
(Beeps)

419
01:16:49,242 --> 01:16:53,440
'Hiya, this is Vince,
sorry, I can't take your call right now.'

420
01:17:00,922 --> 01:17:02,878
(Phone)

421
01:17:06,802 --> 01:17:10,477
- Yes, can I help you?
- I need to speak to Vincent Tyler.

422
01:17:10,562 --> 01:17:13,360
- 'He's in a meeting.'
- It's urgent.

423
01:17:13,442 --> 01:17:16,673
- Could you tell him it's his mother.
- Mrs Tyler?

424
01:17:16,762 --> 01:17:19,834
- 'Yes, that's right.'
- The famous Mrs Tyler.

425
01:17:19,922 --> 01:17:24,234
Mrs Tyler, could I ask you,
were you in this store on the 14th?

426
01:17:25,442 --> 01:17:28,752
Look, whoever you are,
I've got to speak to Vince.

427
01:17:28,842 --> 01:17:33,040
And did you have a meeting with
the head of personnel on the 14th

428
01:17:33,122 --> 01:17:36,512
because I'd like to know
what happened on that day.

429
01:17:36,602 --> 01:17:38,035
Bernie!

430
01:17:38,122 --> 01:17:41,956
- Let me get me trousers on!
- What for? Who's looking?

431
01:17:42,042 --> 01:17:44,715
Fly, my pretties! Fly!

432
01:17:46,802 --> 01:17:49,157
Sorry, it's compulsory.

433
01:17:49,242 --> 01:17:54,236
Supervisor Delicatessen becomes
Front Line Manager Delicatessen.

434
01:17:54,322 --> 01:17:58,713
Assistant Supervisors become
Assistant Front Line Managers.

435
01:17:58,802 --> 01:18:00,520
(Clears throat)

436
01:18:01,482 --> 01:18:05,361
Right, I know it's a pain
but there's a good reason

437
01:18:05,442 --> 01:18:07,797
cos all the Front Line Managers

438
01:18:07,882 --> 01:18:11,636
and Assistant
Front Line Managers, erm...

439
01:18:11,722 --> 01:18:15,681
can get six weeks a year
in administration.

440
01:18:18,602 --> 01:18:22,675
Right, so you can choose
six weeks in one block,

441
01:18:22,762 --> 01:18:25,993
two blocks of three weeks
or three blocks of two.

442
01:18:26,082 --> 01:18:27,435
Nathan!

443
01:18:29,522 --> 01:18:32,480
- Telephone. Says it's urgent.
- Who is it?

444
01:18:33,962 --> 01:18:39,116
Call yourself a gay man? There's a great
big palaver and you're missing it!

445
01:18:44,282 --> 01:18:49,037
We're still gonna do individual product
promotion - the IPP scheme -

446
01:18:49,122 --> 01:18:55,641
but from now on you're responsible
for finding your own individual product.

447
01:18:57,802 --> 01:19:01,351
And we need your name
and chosen product...

448
01:19:02,482 --> 01:19:05,155
so that goes to the Front Line Manager...

449
01:19:06,722 --> 01:19:08,553
by Thursday.

450
01:19:10,762 --> 01:19:14,118
Right, erm... Oh, I've said that already.

451
01:19:14,202 --> 01:19:16,762
Chosen product to Line...

452
01:19:16,842 --> 01:19:20,994
If you could finish we've
got a store to run. Thank you, Vince.

453
01:19:23,042 --> 01:19:24,998
It's Mrs Peel, isn't it?

454
01:19:25,082 --> 01:19:30,236
- I think you'll find that's Mrs Tyler.
- It's Tyler-Peel. We're from Cheshire.

455
01:19:30,322 --> 01:19:33,837
- Sorry, i-it's my mother.
- It's a real emergency.

456
01:19:33,922 --> 01:19:37,835
- I need a word with Vince.
- You met this woman on the 14th...

457
01:19:37,922 --> 01:19:40,994
- Graham, sit down.
- The day of the interview.

458
01:19:41,082 --> 01:19:45,314
- Stuart's leaving, not coming back.
- I know, I'm not stupid.

459
01:19:45,402 --> 01:19:50,430
- He's going to London!
- It's about time he did! Leave it...

460
01:19:50,522 --> 01:19:55,152
- Vince, I'd like a word.
- Something happened on the 14th.

461
01:19:55,242 --> 01:19:58,234
I demand that you talk to this... creature.

462
01:19:58,322 --> 01:20:00,836
Oi! That's my mother.

463
01:20:00,922 --> 01:20:03,072
And that's your problem, Vince.

464
01:20:03,162 --> 01:20:06,552
Graham, as a friend of mine
is very fond of saying...

465
01:20:06,642 --> 01:20:10,681
- fuck off!
- (Graham) Ohh! That's nice!

466
01:20:10,762 --> 01:20:14,311
That's how the deputy manager reacts -
listen to that.

467
01:20:14,402 --> 01:20:17,155
A fine family, all of 'em.

468
01:20:17,242 --> 01:20:19,119
You know what?

469
01:20:19,202 --> 01:20:20,954
He's right.

470
01:20:21,042 --> 01:20:23,397
Fuck off isn't enough.

471
01:20:23,482 --> 01:20:25,393
- Marcie.
- Yes, sir?

472
01:20:25,482 --> 01:20:29,111
The floor's yours
and the subject is Christmas '99.

473
01:20:31,242 --> 01:20:34,279
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
Right, point of order,

474
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:38,719
if Graham Beck is so keen on the truth
why doesn't he tell his fiancée

475
01:20:38,802 --> 01:20:42,431
that Christmas '99
he shagged me in refrigeration?

476
01:20:42,522 --> 01:20:45,355
- I knew it!
- It felt like refrigeration.

477
01:20:45,442 --> 01:20:48,161
- I did not - I swear to God.
- Small dick!

478
01:20:48,242 --> 01:20:50,358
That's him! Come here, bastard!

479
01:20:50,442 --> 01:20:54,594
(Claire) Sit down!
(Marcie) And Vanessa - she's had him.

480
01:20:54,682 --> 01:20:56,081
Bang.

481
01:21:05,962 --> 01:21:08,157
Vince?! Where are you going?

482
01:21:08,242 --> 01:21:09,595
London.

483
01:21:09,682 --> 01:21:11,752
Oh, my God, I'm going to London!

484
01:21:11,842 --> 01:21:13,798
See ya!

485
01:21:16,002 --> 01:21:18,755
Out the way, I'm driving! You're too slow.

486
01:21:18,842 --> 01:21:20,798
You haven't passed your test!

487
01:21:20,882 --> 01:21:22,838
That's why I'm not slow!

488
01:21:27,362 --> 01:21:30,081
- (Bernard) Oi!
- Excess baggage!

489
01:21:40,362 --> 01:21:43,320
(* Colonel Bogey played on kazoos)

490
01:21:47,362 --> 01:21:49,796
(Hazel) Come on, what's going on?!

491
01:21:52,802 --> 01:21:57,159
- How long is this gonna be?
- Just take it easy.

492
01:21:57,242 --> 01:21:59,153
Crikey. Mate, back up!

493
01:21:59,242 --> 01:22:01,233
- I can't!
- Back up!

494
01:22:01,322 --> 01:22:04,519
- I can't!
- Who the fuck invented the kazoo?

495
01:22:05,802 --> 01:22:07,758
Sixteen years, you two.

496
01:22:09,002 --> 01:22:12,153
- Nathan Maloney was just being born.
- (Sighs)

497
01:22:13,242 --> 01:22:16,518
Remind me again,
who was it taught you to drive?

498
01:22:16,602 --> 01:22:19,514
Stuart Alan Jones. My 40th birthday.

499
01:22:19,602 --> 01:22:22,355
And how much did you learn?

500
01:22:22,442 --> 01:22:24,512
I learned the lot.

501
01:22:24,602 --> 01:22:26,638
Hold it! Hold it!

502
01:22:26,722 --> 01:22:28,599
(Screaming)

503
01:22:28,682 --> 01:22:30,115
(Honks horn)

504
01:22:30,202 --> 01:22:31,999
He's not gay!

505
01:22:41,202 --> 01:22:43,158
(Siren wailing)

506
01:22:53,402 --> 01:22:55,358
(Siren winding down)

507
01:22:57,602 --> 01:23:00,036
I've got to go. I've really got to go!

508
01:23:00,122 --> 01:23:03,194
No one's going anywhere.
Just calm down, sir.

509
01:23:03,282 --> 01:23:05,955
I was driving! He's done nothing wrong!

510
01:23:06,042 --> 01:23:09,717
You're in enough trouble,
don't add resisting arrest.

511
01:23:09,802 --> 01:23:12,714
(Policeman) What they saying
back at base?

512
01:23:15,802 --> 01:23:18,760
Never mind him, look after yourself.

513
01:23:21,402 --> 01:23:24,792
If I've got to be arrested
it might as well be worth it.

514
01:23:24,882 --> 01:23:26,759
How's that, love?

515
01:23:28,162 --> 01:23:30,630
- Bloody hell!
- Come on, let's have you.

516
01:23:30,722 --> 01:23:33,520
Run, you daft bastard!

517
01:23:47,082 --> 01:23:49,357
Nice try. You're not coming.

518
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:51,398
I'll do what I like.

519
01:23:51,482 --> 01:23:53,279
You're not.

520
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:57,674
It'll just be you and me, Stuart and Vince,
an old married couple.

521
01:23:57,762 --> 01:24:01,437
Not a shag in sight.
I'm not settling down, ever.

522
01:24:01,522 --> 01:24:06,038
London though? London's rubbish.
Kids go to London.

523
01:24:06,122 --> 01:24:07,919
Where else is there?

524
01:24:08,002 --> 01:24:11,074
I'd go out. Straight ahead and out.

525
01:24:11,162 --> 01:24:14,711
Keep moving. You can't settle down
if you don't stop.

526
01:24:14,802 --> 01:24:19,080
I've been thinking about this for years.
Press the button.

527
01:24:19,162 --> 01:24:22,279
Dematerialise. Step out. New planet.

528
01:24:23,522 --> 01:24:26,355
Says the supermarket boy.

529
01:24:26,442 --> 01:24:29,036
I'm on the run - from the police.

530
01:24:31,842 --> 01:24:34,640
- Don't be so camp.
- Watch it.

531
01:24:34,722 --> 01:24:37,475
- All your dependents of yours.
- They'll survive.

532
01:24:37,562 --> 01:24:39,518
And I won't?

533
01:24:42,242 --> 01:24:44,039
You might not.

534
01:24:45,322 --> 01:24:48,439
No passengers.
You let me down, I'll kill you.

535
01:24:48,522 --> 01:24:50,478
Not if I kill you first.

536
01:24:53,602 --> 01:24:55,797
So what are we waiting for?

537
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:16,914
- Happy birthday.
- What are you doing?

538
01:25:17,002 --> 01:25:19,072
- We're off!
- Off where?

539
01:25:19,162 --> 01:25:22,552
Where do you think, young fella me lad?

540
01:25:22,642 --> 01:25:25,315
Into the headlines!

541
01:25:25,402 --> 01:25:27,836
You might finally get that shag.

542
01:25:27,922 --> 01:25:30,880
Oh, give up, stop chasing me(!)

543
01:25:30,962 --> 01:25:34,352
- But you're coming back?
- What, come back to this?

544
01:25:34,442 --> 01:25:38,913
The ghetto? Alleyways stinking of piss,
beggars in every doorway,

545
01:25:39,002 --> 01:25:42,711
straights and students
coming to look at the freak show?

546
01:25:42,802 --> 01:25:47,114
All the idiots saving all the stupid money
from their stupid jobs

547
01:25:47,202 --> 01:25:49,796
to shoot their load with some stranger?

548
01:25:49,882 --> 01:25:52,874
- (Thunder rumbles)
- Just you look after it,

549
01:25:52,962 --> 01:25:54,918
this stupid little street.

550
01:25:55,802 --> 01:25:57,758
It's the middle of the world.

551
01:25:57,842 --> 01:26:00,834
Cos on a street like this,
every single night,

552
01:26:00,922 --> 01:26:05,200
anyone can meet anyone and
every night someone meets someone.

553
01:26:05,282 --> 01:26:07,432
It's all yours now.

554
01:26:10,242 --> 01:26:13,200
All of them. All the poofs
and all the dykes

555
01:26:13,282 --> 01:26:15,238
and all the people in between.

556
01:26:16,322 --> 01:26:19,553
And this lot, they'll shag you,
they'll rob you.

557
01:26:19,642 --> 01:26:24,318
Some of them might even love you.
And they'll all forget you in the end.

558
01:26:24,402 --> 01:26:29,556
- Stick with your friends, you'll be fine.
- You fuck it up and I'll come back.

559
01:26:54,802 --> 01:26:56,121
Oh...

560
01:26:56,202 --> 01:26:57,317
my...

561
01:26:57,402 --> 01:26:59,199
God!

562
01:27:46,162 --> 01:27:48,392
- Faggots.
- Excuse me?

563
01:27:49,482 --> 01:27:51,438
What did you say?

564
01:27:52,522 --> 01:27:54,274
You heard me.

565
01:27:54,362 --> 01:27:58,116
Cos I better warn you,
my friend's got a hell of a temper.

566
01:27:58,202 --> 01:28:01,672
Once he's off. So... what did you say?

567
01:28:02,722 --> 01:28:04,678
I said...

568
01:28:06,402 --> 01:28:08,154
Faggots.

569
01:28:08,242 --> 01:28:10,198
What do you think?

570
01:28:15,522 --> 01:28:16,875
Blood.

571
01:28:35,282 --> 01:28:37,079
Hold on a tick.

572
01:28:37,162 --> 01:28:40,393
Bit deaf, mate -
too many nights out clubbing.

573
01:28:40,482 --> 01:28:44,316
So, one more time, what did you say?

574
01:28:46,562 --> 01:28:48,120
Nothin'.

575
01:28:48,202 --> 01:28:50,955
And one more word, beginning with "S".

576
01:28:52,842 --> 01:28:54,116
Sorry.

577
01:29:04,962 --> 01:29:06,918
Maybe next time.

578
01:29:08,002 --> 01:29:09,958
Fuck off.

579
01:29:10,305 --> 01:29:16,505
