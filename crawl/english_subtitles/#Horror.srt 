2
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:07,826
     -That was incredible.

3
00:01:13,097 --> 00:01:15,330
     How did you get to be
       so extraordinary?

4
00:01:17,032 --> 00:01:18,966
         Aah, oh, yeah!

5
00:01:18,968 --> 00:01:21,601
    I wanna hear all about..

6
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:26,138
 -I can think of better things
      to do than to talk..

7
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,240
  -I'm just excited we get to
 go away for our dirty weekend.

8
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:33,643
    -What's a dirty weekend?
What is that, a Brit expression?

9
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,545
         -No, Angelica
       told me about it.

10
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:38,647
It's one of those weekends away.

11
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:40,448
      Somewhere you're not
  supposed to be with someone

12
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,149
you're not supposed to be with.

13
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,420
    Okay, I'm gonna go pack.

14
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:08,503
     -<i> Where are you, Harry?</i>

15
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:18,344
   You're thinking of a lie?
        -<i> I know, sorry.</i>

16
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:21,679
 Look, I have to leave tonight

17
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:24,248
  but I'll be back on Monday,
             okay?

18
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,184
    You know that new artist
      I've been watching?

19
00:02:27,186 --> 00:02:30,720
  <i> Well, he's about to blow up</i>
  <i> and I don't want to miss it.</i>

20
00:02:30,722 --> 00:02:33,322
          <i> I'm driving</i>
      <i> to the airport now.</i>

21
00:02:33,324 --> 00:02:34,823
 <i> I don't have a tail number yet</i>

22
00:02:34,825 --> 00:02:37,826
       <i> but I'll call you</i>
       <i> as soon as I land.</i>

23
00:02:37,828 --> 00:02:40,395
   -This is bullshit, Harry.

24
00:02:40,397 --> 00:02:42,563
      <i> It's our anniversary</i>
       <i> for Christ's sake.</i>

25
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:47,300
       <i> Are you with that</i>
    <i> 20-year-old art advisor?</i>

26
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:49,101
    And what's she advising
        you on, really?

27
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:51,103
    -<i> Come on, babe, please.</i>

28
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,939
 -Look, I may not be perfect..

29
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:57,541
     ...but I'm as perfect
      as you're gonna get.

30
00:03:11,856 --> 00:03:13,189
            -Dammit.

31
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,572
        -It wasn't real.

32
00:04:47,574 --> 00:04:49,473
 It wasn't real, it's not real.

33
00:04:49,475 --> 00:04:51,141
         It's not real.

34
00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:57,011
           I'm okay.

35
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,347
      <i> Everything is okay.</i>
      <i> It's gonna be okay.</i>

36
00:05:30,943 --> 00:05:33,177
 -Are you sure you don't wanna
   go to the movies instead?

37
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:35,312
       You know, we could
  get a big bucket of popcorn

38
00:05:35,314 --> 00:05:38,114
 and I promise I won't ask you
     any annoying questions

39
00:05:38,116 --> 00:05:40,349
 or say anything embarrassing.

40
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:42,017
       I'll even pretend
       I don't know you.

41
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:43,952
         -Mom, come on,
   I really like these girls.

42
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:46,154
    They're my new friends.

43
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:50,524
   -How about that cute girl,
       Katie, next door?

44
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:52,993
  I heard she really wants you
       to come over, eh..

45
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:55,862
 We can turn around and you can
     go hang out with her.

46
00:05:55,864 --> 00:05:58,130
   I'm sure she's a lot nicer
than all these new fancy girls.

47
00:05:58,132 --> 00:05:59,631
         -Katie is 11.

48
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:01,633
        -Oh, I'm sorry.

49
00:06:03,402 --> 00:06:04,934
   Look, I know Dr. Hutchins
       said you're ready

50
00:06:04,936 --> 00:06:07,803
   but I just wanna make sure
      that you feel ready.

51
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:11,506
 Please don't tell these girls
   about your sensitivities.

52
00:06:11,508 --> 00:06:13,741
   I know you're still having
     nightmares and seeing
         weird things.

53
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:16,610
           -I'm good.
        Pull over here.

54
00:06:16,612 --> 00:06:18,178
 -We're still two houses away.

55
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,546
     In this neighborhood,
      that could be miles.

56
00:06:19,548 --> 00:06:20,713
  I'll drive you to the door.

57
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,781
       -I'm fine. Really.

58
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,151
   -You're embarrassed of me,
          aren't you?

59
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:30,888
  -Mom, these girls would die
  if they saw me in this car.

60
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,489
       -You used to love
         this old turd!

61
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:35,525
    -Don't make me feel bad.

62
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:38,928
        -Just remember,
   money can't buy happiness.

63
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,630
It's usually just more problems.

64
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:43,632
      -How would you know?

65
00:06:48,937 --> 00:06:51,305
      -Alright, come here.
           Come here.

66
00:06:51,973 --> 00:06:54,107
          I love you.

67
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:56,876
   Call me when you're ready
     and I'll pick you up.

68
00:06:56,878 --> 00:06:59,211
       -Mom, I told you,
       I'm sleeping over.

69
00:07:02,747 --> 00:07:03,780
           -This way.

70
00:07:03,782 --> 00:07:07,083
I'll get over and fix it.

71
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:19,649
            -Hello?

72
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,120
            <i> Sophia?</i>

73
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:31,459
             Hello?

74
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:44,369
            Sophia!

75
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:48,840
              Cat?

76
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:02,452
             Hello?

77
00:09:19,135 --> 00:09:20,335
    -<i> Why did you invite her?</i>

78
00:09:20,337 --> 00:09:21,803
    We don't even know her.

79
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:22,837
    -We don't even like her.

80
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:24,305
  -Yeah, and she smells weird.

81
00:09:24,307 --> 00:09:25,706
     -<i> It's just her breath.</i>

82
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,274
 <i> Maybe she's allergic to dairy.</i>

83
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:28,408
 We'll just give her some gum.

84
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,343
         -Okay, Sophia,
    to answer the question.

85
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:32,812
    Why did you invite that
  new weird girl to our party?

86
00:09:32,814 --> 00:09:34,747
      -I didn't, Cat did.

87
00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:37,416
    -<i> Oh, Cat. What an angel.</i>

88
00:09:37,418 --> 00:09:39,217
     Her heart is so pure.

89
00:09:42,587 --> 00:09:44,421
         -Hi. I'm here.

90
00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:45,789
           -Hi, Sam.
           -Hi, Sam.

91
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,423
    -Your house is so cool.

92
00:09:47,425 --> 00:09:50,559
     -<i> Aww, that's so nice,</i>
        <i> I hate it here.</i>

93
00:09:50,561 --> 00:09:53,695
        My old house was
   so much better and bigger.

94
00:09:53,697 --> 00:09:56,130
    My dad says my mom and I
     should be so grateful

95
00:09:56,132 --> 00:09:58,465
  to be living in an artwork.

96
00:09:58,467 --> 00:10:01,034
      -<i> It is pretty cool.</i>
           -I guess.

97
00:10:01,036 --> 00:10:04,103
      -Yeah, my old house
is way bigger than this new one.

98
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:05,871
       I totally hear ya.

99
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:07,038
            -Really?

100
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,839
      Maybe that's because
      you get so much more

101
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,674
 bang for your buck in Norwalk.

102
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,343
   -No, we live in Greenwich.

103
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:20,716
        -Fake is better.

104
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:43,601
         -<i> Yes, Mr. Tao,</i>
 <i> but I understand, yes, and, uh</i>

105
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:47,171
 <i> yes, I, uh, thank you so much</i>
    <i> for not suspending her.</i>

106
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:49,206
     <i> It means a lot to me.</i>
         <i> And I owe you.</i>

107
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,541
          Now, listen,
  I got to jump off, I'm, uh..

108
00:10:51,543 --> 00:10:53,109
      I'm at the hospital
       right now actually

109
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,977
          and there's
  a medical emergency going on

110
00:10:54,979 --> 00:10:58,580
       so I have to, uh,
         I have to go.

111
00:10:58,582 --> 00:11:01,349
    I appreciate. Thank you.

112
00:11:08,223 --> 00:11:11,425
  You can't just leave, okay?

113
00:11:11,427 --> 00:11:13,894
   No matter how bad it gets.

114
00:11:13,896 --> 00:11:16,062
           You're 12.

115
00:11:16,064 --> 00:11:20,566
  I mean, if it ever gets that
  bad, you call me...alright?

116
00:11:20,568 --> 00:11:22,367
     That's what you'll do.

117
00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:23,835
    -Yes, daddy, I agree --

118
00:11:23,837 --> 00:11:25,303
          -I want you
      to learn something.

119
00:11:25,305 --> 00:11:26,971
  I want you to pay attention,
      I want you to focus.

120
00:11:26,973 --> 00:11:28,405
   I want you to concentrate.

121
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:30,473
   <i> All this other thing that</i>
    <i> you do with your friends</i>

122
00:11:30,475 --> 00:11:32,475
     <i> picking on each other,</i>
        <i> bullying each..</i>

123
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:33,976
     <i> Whatever it is, I want</i>
    <i> you to stop doing that.</i>

124
00:11:33,978 --> 00:11:35,243
       <i> That's gonna stop.</i>

125
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:37,144
   You're not gonna remember
      any of these people

126
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:39,312
    later in life, alright?

127
00:11:39,314 --> 00:11:41,080
    No one's gonna remember
        who bullied who.

128
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:43,549
      <i> It's the 7th grade.</i>

129
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:45,651
  <i> Now how bad could just being</i>
   <i> there, learning something</i>

130
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:49,487
    <i> and paying attention be?</i>

131
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:52,523
       Do you understand?
         -Yes. Daddy --

132
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:55,959
        -The only thing
     that matters right now

133
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:59,828
    are getting good grades
and what school you'll get into.

134
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,162
           That's it.

135
00:12:01,164 --> 00:12:02,897
         -It was a huge
       misunderstanding.

136
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:05,466
       -Explain to me how
  this is a misunderstanding.

137
00:12:05,468 --> 00:12:08,302
    -You just don't get it.
      -How...oh, I, okay.

138
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:10,570
         I accept that.
        I don't get it.

139
00:12:10,572 --> 00:12:12,572
       So make me get it.
     -I wasn't being mean.

140
00:12:12,574 --> 00:12:14,173
      It's just how we tag
       each other online.

141
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:16,341
             It's..
      All the kids do it.

142
00:12:16,343 --> 00:12:18,009
     -What does that mean?
        Tag each other.

143
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:19,543
          -<i> It's just..</i>

144
00:12:19,545 --> 00:12:21,111
 It's kind of like a nickname.

145
00:12:21,113 --> 00:12:22,846
        Like a username.
   -What -- what do you mean?

146
00:12:22,848 --> 00:12:24,547
 -It doesn't matter, it's fine.

147
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:26,815
   It's just, it's not mean.
  That's all you have to know.

148
00:12:26,817 --> 00:12:29,551
         It's not mean.
        -Then why is he
       telling me it is?

149
00:12:29,553 --> 00:12:31,920
      -'Cause some people
   think it is, but it's not.

150
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:33,788
       -<i> I don't want you,</i>
 <i> I don't want you to lie to me.</i>

151
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,924
     I want you to tell me
     what's really going on

152
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:40,427
 because he's saying one thing,
           you left.

153
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:41,661
You're not supposed to do that.

154
00:12:41,663 --> 00:12:44,063
         And he told me
    that you are picking on

155
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:45,764
    some of the other girls.

156
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,065
      Girls that I thought
       were your friends.

157
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:48,199
     -They are my friends.

158
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,700
        -<i> Then why is he</i>
        <i> telling me that?</i>

159
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:52,301
     -'Cause I don't know.

160
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:53,802
    -Okay, look, it doesn't
   matter. Here's the thing.

161
00:12:53,804 --> 00:12:56,204
You did something wrong, you're
   gonna pay the price, okay?

162
00:12:56,206 --> 00:12:57,338
    That's the way it works.

163
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,639
    <i> You do something wrong,</i>
          <i> you have to</i>

164
00:12:58,641 --> 00:13:00,173
  <i> because if you don't pay now</i>

165
00:13:00,175 --> 00:13:01,307
    <i> eventually you are gonna</i>
           <i> pay later.</i>

166
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:03,075
      <i> Better to do it now.</i>
           -Yes, sir.

167
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:10,348
   Don't worry about it, dad.

168
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,416
   It's bad for your health.

169
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:15,218
     -Don't manipulate me.

170
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,420
 We talked about that, alright?

171
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:27,762
    You're taking your meds?

172
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:29,130
             <i> Yeah?</i>

173
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:30,598
   Now there's another thing
  I want to talk to you about.

174
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,200
            Bennet.

175
00:13:33,202 --> 00:13:35,202
       I don't like him.
     -You've never met him.

176
00:13:35,204 --> 00:13:37,437
 -<i> I don't like him, I, I don't</i>
    <i> want you hanging around</i>
       <i> with him anymore.</i>

177
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:41,140
       <i> I mean, he's, he's</i>
       <i> worse than Sophia.</i>

178
00:13:41,142 --> 00:13:42,841
    I want you to be happy.

179
00:13:45,811 --> 00:13:49,112
    I really do. I just want
     all of us to be okay.

180
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:53,982
I'll take you to Sophia's later.

181
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:56,117
   I'm not gonna ground you.

182
00:14:01,756 --> 00:14:03,456
          But I think
      our takeaway here is

183
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,157
  that we need to try harder.

184
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,791
  <i> I'm trying as hard as I can.</i>

185
00:14:06,793 --> 00:14:08,526
        <i> You try harder.</i>

186
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:12,161
          -I hate you.

187
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,613
             -Ted?

188
00:15:11,617 --> 00:15:13,617
          Hello, boys.

189
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,255
    -Alex, I think we gotta
  wrap it up. We gotta finish
           on Monday.

190
00:15:19,257 --> 00:15:22,324
  -Oh, no, that's impossible.
  I'm having people tomorrow.

191
00:15:22,326 --> 00:15:24,726
 I mean, it's a mess in here..
       It's crazy making.

192
00:15:24,728 --> 00:15:26,994
It's chaos, absolute chaos, Ted.

193
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:29,463
   -Uh, Alex, we've been here
          since 6 a.m.

194
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:32,466
      -Can't you just stay
    a little later? Come on.

195
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:35,502
   You've stayed late for me
      before, haven't you?

196
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:45,277
 -Alex, I'll see you on Monday.

197
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,545
      -What day is today?
         -<i> It's Friday.</i>

198
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:51,181
- Monday is too far away, Ted.

199
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:54,117
      -Well, see you then.

200
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,785
         -See you then.

201
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:34,020
   -Funny guy, helped me over
    where that track leads.

202
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:37,189
         -Jesus, Alex,
      you look incredible.

203
00:16:37,191 --> 00:16:40,559
      I mean, better than
       when you were 25.
              -No.

204
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:43,028
      -I gotta get myself
       to that Dr. White.

205
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,030
     That's all him, right?

206
00:16:45,898 --> 00:16:48,799
   So where's the front door?

207
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:50,333
      -He's fucking nuts.

208
00:16:50,335 --> 00:16:53,336
    Don't know where anyone
      is on this property.

209
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:56,772
        So we each have
   our own wing of the house.

210
00:16:56,774 --> 00:16:59,107
       Great family, huh?

211
00:16:59,109 --> 00:17:03,010
    Relationship is defined
   as shared time and space.

212
00:17:03,012 --> 00:17:06,413
    So now we share no time
         and no space.

213
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:09,382
          Nothing like
  setting us up to fail Harry.

214
00:17:11,551 --> 00:17:13,618
         -Is this where
      Harry does his laps?

215
00:17:18,556 --> 00:17:20,790
    -Tired of this bullshit.

216
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:22,892
  Big boys and their big toys.

217
00:17:22,894 --> 00:17:26,362
     It's not fucking art.
   It's competition and ego.

218
00:17:26,364 --> 00:17:28,363
      Way too much money.

219
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,032
    Might as well be stocks.

220
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:34,134
        The new stocks.

221
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:38,204
         He used to be
    a passionate collector.

222
00:17:38,206 --> 00:17:40,439
  Now he's a currency trader.

223
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:43,807
     -Is that a Dan Colen?

224
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,044
            -Molly!

225
00:17:49,046 --> 00:17:51,179
     Can you get my phone?
    Actually my two phones.

226
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:54,115
I think they're in the kitchen.

227
00:17:54,117 --> 00:17:56,183
             -Wow.
           -You like?

228
00:17:56,185 --> 00:17:58,818
        -<i> I can't believe</i>
         <i> you have that.</i>

229
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,886
        -It doesn't seem
     to be there, Mrs. Cox.

230
00:18:00,888 --> 00:18:02,687
         Uh, maybe you
      left them upstairs.

231
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:04,555
          -Oh, Christ.

232
00:18:04,557 --> 00:18:09,058
  Molly, please, just call me
Alex. Mrs. Cox sounds so stuffy.

233
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,559
         -I'm so sorry.

234
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:12,694
     Alex, it's my manners,
      my mother's English.

235
00:18:12,696 --> 00:18:14,629
   Honestly, you look younger
     than my little sister.

236
00:18:14,631 --> 00:18:16,497
    -Oh, that's very sweet.

237
00:18:16,499 --> 00:18:19,465
        Uh, well, maybe
   they're in the other room?

238
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,800
   Nothing's finished around
     here and the decorator

239
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,334
 promised to be done last week.

240
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,668
    -That is so frustrating.

241
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,302
      -Really winds me up

242
00:18:27,304 --> 00:18:29,971
 when people promise to deliver
         and then fail.

243
00:18:31,306 --> 00:18:33,306
      Why false advertise?

244
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:38,544
     Molly, have you found
         my phones yet?

245
00:18:38,546 --> 00:18:41,346
   -I can't seem to find them
      anywhere, Mrs. Cox.

246
00:18:41,348 --> 00:18:42,680
             Alex.

247
00:18:42,682 --> 00:18:45,149
       Um, maybe you left
        them somewhere.

248
00:18:45,151 --> 00:18:46,650
   Maybe they're in the car.

249
00:18:46,652 --> 00:18:48,852
        -Well, are you,
 are you saying it's my fault?

250
00:18:48,854 --> 00:18:51,721
     -No. No, no, Mrs. Cox.

251
00:18:51,723 --> 00:18:55,124
      -Honestly, have you
   really looked everywhere?

252
00:18:55,126 --> 00:18:57,593
        -Yes. Honestly.

253
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:58,827
     But I can look again.

254
00:18:58,829 --> 00:19:00,161
          -Good idea.

255
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:05,799
       -Is she retarded?

256
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:07,500
       -I think she stole
       my Victorian cuff.

257
00:19:07,502 --> 00:19:09,268
             -What?
           -She did.

258
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,470
         And I've never
      really trusted her.

259
00:19:11,472 --> 00:19:13,605
         Does she look
      like a thief to you?

260
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:15,306
 Maybe just a little dishonest
        around the eyes.

261
00:19:15,308 --> 00:19:16,473
        Can you see it?

262
00:19:16,475 --> 00:19:18,575
            -I think
  you're acting really crazy.

263
00:19:18,577 --> 00:19:20,443
 -Well, I guess I'm just gonna
     have to brave the cold

264
00:19:20,445 --> 00:19:22,745
     and go out to the car
       and search myself.

265
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,347
              Oh.

266
00:19:30,785 --> 00:19:32,785
         That was such
       a big funny move.

267
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:38,156
      Molly, I found them!

268
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:50,734
 -They're building a new wall.

269
00:19:54,671 --> 00:19:56,838
      Building a new wall.

270
00:19:57,673 --> 00:19:59,407
             There.

271
00:20:00,308 --> 00:20:02,676
        I like the, uh..

272
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:04,944
    I like the stone better.

273
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,250
              Hey.

274
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:16,953
              Hey.

275
00:20:16,955 --> 00:20:19,188
          Can you not,
      can you not do that?

276
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,056
              Hey.

277
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:23,258
          Just, just..
          -Dad, stop!

278
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,359
       -Just don't do it.

279
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:27,161
   Don't do it for 5 minutes,
             okay?

280
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:40,807
    Give me that. 5 minutes!

281
00:20:49,847 --> 00:20:52,081
     -Thanks for the ride.

282
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:21,373
           -Perfect.

283
00:22:07,582 --> 00:22:10,350
  -Did Harry tell you anything
       about the rumors?

284
00:22:10,352 --> 00:22:12,652
 The old legend of this place?
              -No.

285
00:22:12,654 --> 00:22:14,787
     Why, was it a brothel
         or something?

286
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:18,423
 -No. It was designed and built
   by this friend of Warhol.

287
00:22:18,425 --> 00:22:20,124
   This artist, Ray Jamieson

288
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:23,026
   he made all of his darkest
   and most disturbing pieces

289
00:22:23,028 --> 00:22:24,727
    when he was living here.

290
00:22:24,729 --> 00:22:26,829
    You know this stuff that
    goes for a fortune now.

291
00:22:26,831 --> 00:22:28,764
     -Wait, that's the guy
  that Harry is obsessed with.

292
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:31,399
   -Yeah, I'm sure that's why
      he bought the place.

293
00:22:31,401 --> 00:22:33,768
 Ray Jamieson went crazy here.

294
00:22:35,036 --> 00:22:36,636
 There was this legendary party

295
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:39,472
  <i> where Ray Jamieson's psychic</i>
       <i> gave this reading.</i>

296
00:22:39,474 --> 00:22:42,007
Supposedly she tapped into that
       this is the place

297
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:43,675
        where the vortex
    of the 4 winds converge.

298
00:22:44,778 --> 00:22:46,978
             Shit.

299
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,813
  Do you want me to help you?

300
00:22:48,815 --> 00:22:50,714
         -Don't worry.

301
00:22:50,716 --> 00:22:52,615
         Just tell me.

302
00:22:54,751 --> 00:22:56,685
  -Much later that same night

303
00:22:56,687 --> 00:22:59,120
     Ray Jamieson ended up
        brutally killing

304
00:22:59,122 --> 00:23:02,656
    all of these people that
   wouldn't leave his party.

305
00:23:02,658 --> 00:23:05,592
       <i> Haven't you always</i>
  <i> wanted to do that? I mean..</i>

306
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:07,393
      <i> But he actually did.</i>

307
00:23:07,395 --> 00:23:09,595
  <i> That's really fucking dark.</i>

308
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:12,497
   <i> Anyway, his body vanished.</i>
     <i> They never found him.</i>

309
00:23:12,499 --> 00:23:16,500
           <i> Supposedly</i>
      <i> he committed suicide</i>
    <i> on this property, but..</i>

310
00:23:16,502 --> 00:23:18,768
 <i> ...they never found the body.</i>

311
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,270
- Wish I could leave tomorrow.

312
00:23:30,745 --> 00:23:32,512
    -I wonder where Cat is.

313
00:23:32,514 --> 00:23:34,814
      -She's such a case.

314
00:23:34,816 --> 00:23:36,782
 -Her mom died last year. Duh.

315
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:38,750
       -I heard she OD'd
        on painkillers.

316
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,784
 Ones that Cat's dad gave her.

317
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,521
         -You're here.

318
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:45,788
           -Hi, Cat.

319
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,891
        -You really have
       a lateness issue.

320
00:23:48,893 --> 00:23:50,425
      -My mom always said.

321
00:23:50,427 --> 00:23:52,393
It's better to make an entrance.

322
00:23:52,395 --> 00:23:55,062
       -Your mom and like
    a billion other people.

323
00:23:55,064 --> 00:23:56,463
      -Cat, where'd you go
          after lunch?

324
00:23:56,465 --> 00:23:57,564
     You weren't in school.

325
00:23:57,566 --> 00:23:58,998
   -Did you cut class again?

326
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
      -I'm not letting you
      borrow my homework.

327
00:24:01,002 --> 00:24:03,736
         -I don't want
   your homework, Francesca.

328
00:24:03,738 --> 00:24:05,738
        -No way. No way.
              -Ew.

329
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,539
             -<i> Whoa!</i>

330
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,641
            -No way.
          -Hey, guys..

331
00:24:09,643 --> 00:24:11,576
       -<i> We get together.</i>
        <i> We get together.</i>

332
00:24:11,578 --> 00:24:13,277
   -<i> My God, we have so many..</i>
      <i> Look, how many likes</i>
        <i> we're gonna get.</i>

333
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,480
        -<i> Are you ready?</i>
      -Okay, imagine this
    with, like, sunglasses.

334
00:24:16,482 --> 00:24:20,116
        It's the beach,
with a lot of cute boys around.

335
00:24:24,487 --> 00:24:27,021
     -That would be, like,
 a perfect perfume commercial.

336
00:24:27,023 --> 00:24:29,390
          -<i> Oh, my God.</i>

337
00:24:29,392 --> 00:24:31,425
      -<i> Sam, give it to me.</i>

338
00:24:32,627 --> 00:24:34,894
       -Guys, can someone
       zip me up, please?

339
00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:37,296
          -Oh, my God.
             -Oh..

340
00:24:37,298 --> 00:24:38,797
             -Whoa!
         -Wow, Sophia.

341
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,732
   -<i> It's, like, the best one.</i>
      -<i> You look so pretty.</i>

342
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,467
         -<i> Ready, smile.</i>

343
00:24:46,203 --> 00:24:49,238
   -Imagine you're on fashion
 show. Okay, everybody line up.

344
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,607
   Line up, line up, line up.

345
00:24:52,943 --> 00:24:54,809
    -I'm matching your step.

346
00:25:04,152 --> 00:25:06,286
              -Go.
         -Yeah, Sophia.

347
00:25:13,727 --> 00:25:14,993
             -Whoo!

348
00:25:20,265 --> 00:25:23,100
     -Look at that outfit.
  -Look at you in the mirror.

349
00:25:23,102 --> 00:25:25,102
      -<i> She's just jealous.</i>

350
00:25:26,771 --> 00:25:29,873
      -Guys, imagine these
  in, like, really high heels.

351
00:25:33,444 --> 00:25:35,778
         -Someone take
        a picture of me.

352
00:25:39,982 --> 00:25:41,682
       Stop. That's mean.

353
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:55,928
           -Awesome.
           -Awesome!

354
00:26:07,373 --> 00:26:10,173
        -Take a picture
       of us, kitty Cat.

355
00:26:10,175 --> 00:26:11,674
          -I hate when
       you call me that.

356
00:26:11,676 --> 00:26:13,442
          -Oh, please,
       just a quick one.

357
00:26:13,444 --> 00:26:14,810
     -You all look stupid.

358
00:26:14,812 --> 00:26:16,912
          -<i> Oh, please,</i>
      <i> you're just jealous.</i>

359
00:26:16,914 --> 00:26:20,048
  -<i> And I really want a picture</i>
     <i> of me and my besties.</i>

360
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:26,119
    -Don't do it from there.
          Her mom says
     that's for bad girls.

361
00:26:26,121 --> 00:26:28,654
     -I still can't believe
    how cool this place is.

362
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:31,189
     -I'm warming up to it.
            I think.

363
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:32,924
         -You know what
     happened here, right?

364
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:34,825
 I overheard your mom's friend
        telling your mom

365
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:38,695
    about this crazy artist
 killer who used to live here.

366
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:41,030
     <i> Supposedly this place</i>
     <i> is haunted by this guy</i>

367
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,198
     Ray Jamieson's ghost.

368
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,500
     He went crazy because
      of an energy vortex

369
00:26:45,502 --> 00:26:48,436
     created by the 4 winds
  converging on this property.

370
00:26:48,438 --> 00:26:51,906
      -You're lying again.

371
00:26:51,908 --> 00:26:55,809
         -The 4 winds?
    That sounds like a fart.

372
00:26:55,811 --> 00:26:57,410
    -<i> Wait. Wait, wait, wait.</i>

373
00:26:57,412 --> 00:27:00,379
Ray Jamieson is still considered
       a missing person.

374
00:27:00,381 --> 00:27:04,515
 In 1968, Jamieson disappeared
 following a nervous breakdown

375
00:27:04,517 --> 00:27:07,484
    that lead him to commit
   6 murders in his own home.

376
00:27:07,486 --> 00:27:09,118
Jamieson's body was never found.

377
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,754
 -So? My mom's having a nervous
    breakdown like everyday.

378
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,822
 You think she's gonna kill us?

379
00:27:14,824 --> 00:27:16,757
  <i> Come on, let's stop talking</i>
        <i> about this shit</i>

380
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,458
and get back to taking pictures.

381
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,661
   I want the coolest picture
   ever of me and my besties.

382
00:27:21,663 --> 00:27:23,763
         Cat, come on.

383
00:27:23,765 --> 00:27:25,097
             -Fine.

384
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:29,167
            -<i> Cheese.</i>

385
00:27:30,802 --> 00:27:33,069
   -Oh, my God, I'm falling,
          I'm falling.

386
00:27:37,007 --> 00:27:40,309
     -<i> Cat, that's so mean.</i>
     <i> What's wrong with you?</i>

387
00:27:40,311 --> 00:27:42,010
         -You, Sophia.

388
00:27:42,012 --> 00:27:43,478
    You're such a hypocrite.

389
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,213
     I hate girls like you.

390
00:27:45,215 --> 00:27:47,114
    It's all an act, Sophia.

391
00:27:47,116 --> 00:27:50,450
      That's what you do,
         you act nice.

392
00:27:50,452 --> 00:27:52,051
     But you aren't really.

393
00:27:52,053 --> 00:27:54,787
  -<i> Will you stop being such a</i>
   <i> freak? This is her house.</i>

394
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:57,389
 -It takes a lot more than that
          to scare me.

395
00:27:57,391 --> 00:27:59,657
      -Oh, such a badass.

396
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:01,725
            -<i> Anyway,</i>
       <i> what do you think?</i>

397
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:07,096
         -You look like
       a sausage in that.

398
00:28:07,098 --> 00:28:10,365
      <i> A fat little sausage</i>
    <i> from the Stanford Mall.</i>

399
00:28:12,701 --> 00:28:15,169
     -Cat, you're so mean.

400
00:28:15,171 --> 00:28:18,305
         -No, I'm not.
  It's funny and you laughed.

401
00:28:18,307 --> 00:28:21,341
So nothing is mean if you laugh,
        and you laughed.

402
00:28:21,343 --> 00:28:24,577
      If you didn't laugh,
  then you can say I was mean.

403
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:26,879
        <i> That's the rule.</i>

404
00:28:27,947 --> 00:28:29,447
           -Whatever.

405
00:28:29,449 --> 00:28:31,749
You should try this on instead.

406
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:34,585
       It's...very sexy.

407
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,487
      I'd totally make out
      with you on the lot.

408
00:28:37,489 --> 00:28:39,421
    -<i> What? Who's making out</i>
           <i> with who?</i>

409
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,457
      I don't know, Tats.

410
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:44,392
      His last collection
      was just so sexless.

411
00:28:44,394 --> 00:28:46,327
 I'm gonna go to Paris anyways.

412
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:48,796
Hold on a sec.

413
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:51,064
    Girls, I have to run out
          for an hour

414
00:28:51,066 --> 00:28:52,765
  so, you know, I wish I could
       stay and help you

415
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:54,566
     with your photo shoot.

416
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:57,035
 You seem to be doing a foolish
        job without me.

417
00:28:57,037 --> 00:28:59,971
 I'll pick up pizza on the way
   home, okay? Extra cheese?

418
00:28:59,973 --> 00:29:03,007
   -Mom, can you just pick up
    some Skinny Pop instead?

419
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:06,844
   We're on a diet. No carbs,
      no gluten, no dairy.

420
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:08,545
      Dairy makes everyone
        have halitosis.

421
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:09,946
          -Ew, no way.

422
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,281
        Tats, does dairy
      give you bad breath?

423
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,750
        -<i> Only, if you're</i>
  <i> lactose intolerant, I think.</i>

424
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:17,419
         -Oh, you guys
       look so beautiful.

425
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:19,187
           <i> Stunning.</i>

426
00:29:19,189 --> 00:29:21,222
   Send me some of the photos
you're taking, I want to put it
         in my album --

427
00:29:21,224 --> 00:29:22,823
       -Mom, this is just
         embarrassing.

428
00:29:22,825 --> 00:29:26,226
             -Why?
   -They're already on here.

429
00:29:26,228 --> 00:29:28,995
         -Okay, sorry,
   I don't know these things.

430
00:29:28,997 --> 00:29:31,364
       -Well, you should.
      -<i> I miss dressing up.</i>

431
00:29:31,366 --> 00:29:34,734
        Old days of all
the excitement of getting ready.

432
00:29:34,736 --> 00:29:39,271
     Just remember, girls,
getting ready is the best part.

433
00:29:39,273 --> 00:29:42,240
  It's more fun than any party
    you'll ever gonna go to.

434
00:29:42,242 --> 00:29:44,809
      Enjoy yourselves now
      while you're young.

435
00:29:44,811 --> 00:29:46,343
       Doesn't last long.

436
00:29:46,345 --> 00:29:49,145
   I have a surprise for you.
             Ready?

437
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,383
             Ta-da!

438
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:59,353
          -<i> Oh, my God,</i>
    <i> this one looks so good.</i>

439
00:29:59,355 --> 00:30:00,754
          -Play nice.

440
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:06,125
      -Guys, guys, please.
         This is huge.

441
00:30:33,983 --> 00:30:35,316
             -Shit.

442
00:31:13,318 --> 00:31:16,319
 -Oh, my God! This is amazing!
             -Guys!

443
00:31:17,354 --> 00:31:20,522
  Just a second. I'm married.

444
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:24,492
     -<i> How are we gonna get</i>
     <i> one of these diamonds?</i>

445
00:31:31,298 --> 00:31:33,065
            <i> Almost.</i>

446
00:31:33,067 --> 00:31:35,667
     <i> Almost, guys, almost.</i>

447
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,638
 -Sam, you are not a princess.

448
00:31:44,807 --> 00:31:47,642
    -Oh, what are you doing?

449
00:31:47,644 --> 00:31:49,944
   Oh, my God! Are you crazy?

450
00:31:49,946 --> 00:31:52,246
     -<i> Delusion, obviously.</i>

451
00:31:52,248 --> 00:31:54,982
       -<i> I mean, come on,</i>
          <i> we all know</i>
  <i> you don't live in Greenwich.</i>

452
00:31:54,984 --> 00:31:56,183
        You're the only
        scholarship kid

453
00:31:56,185 --> 00:31:59,019
    our school has ever had.

454
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:01,888
      -Whatever, you guys
      have been all wrong.

455
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:04,156
       <i> I don't know what</i>
    <i> Cat's been telling you.</i>

456
00:32:04,158 --> 00:32:06,558
         -What are you
   saying about me, bitches?

457
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,067
         -Stop it, Cat.

458
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,604
    Don't point a gun at me.
       That's messed up.

459
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,073
       -If it isn't real,
    then what's the problem?

460
00:32:28,277 --> 00:32:30,978
       -Cat, put it down.
        You look stupid.

461
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,412
            -<i> Really?</i>

462
00:32:33,714 --> 00:32:37,083
    What? You wanna kiss me,
           you lesbo?

463
00:32:38,618 --> 00:32:40,418
   -Who's getting burned now?

464
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,052
        -Are you scared?

465
00:32:45,556 --> 00:32:47,623
   -Take a pic of me with it.

466
00:33:11,814 --> 00:33:14,748
          -<i> Let me in!</i>
   <i> I gotta release the beast.</i>

467
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,248
          -One second!

468
00:33:21,855 --> 00:33:24,889
        It's all yours.
  You're free to go barf now.

469
00:33:24,891 --> 00:33:27,191
    -What do I look like --
  -You always run the faucet.

470
00:33:27,193 --> 00:33:28,959
       Now, do you prefer
     I don't run the faucet

471
00:33:28,961 --> 00:33:32,294
    so everyone can hear me
         taking a dump?

472
00:33:32,296 --> 00:33:33,461
              -Ew!

473
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:54,777
   -Georgie, maybe you should
        quit gymnastics

474
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:56,345
        before you start
     to look like a tranny.

475
00:33:58,248 --> 00:34:01,115
     -I haven't been doing
 gymnastics for, like, a year.

476
00:34:01,117 --> 00:34:03,217
        -That's obvious.

477
00:34:03,219 --> 00:34:06,653
     -Maybe you should try
 power Pilates for core fusion.

478
00:34:06,655 --> 00:34:08,354
   -Ava, you're such a tard!

479
00:34:08,356 --> 00:34:10,823
         At this point
  Georgie's way past Pilates.

480
00:34:12,693 --> 00:34:15,860
    -Georgie, I play soccer
      and it's really fun.

481
00:34:15,862 --> 00:34:17,027
   I bet you'd be good at it.

482
00:34:18,864 --> 00:34:20,964
       -I would pay money
          to see that.

483
00:34:20,966 --> 00:34:22,098
      -You guys have been
         really harsh.

484
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,933
      I do exercise, okay?

485
00:34:23,935 --> 00:34:27,236
   I walk to school every day
        and I walk home.

486
00:34:27,238 --> 00:34:30,005
     -Whoa! You don't wanna
        strain yourself.

487
00:34:30,007 --> 00:34:31,539
    -Yes, seriously, Georgie

488
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:34,608
     you may pull a muscle
   or you may twist an ankle.

489
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,543
    -I'm gonna start taking
    dance again this spring.

490
00:34:36,545 --> 00:34:39,946
  Jazz and tap. It's too cold
     to move in the winter.

491
00:34:39,948 --> 00:34:41,914
 -Georgie, you're really funny.

492
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:44,349
        -Yeah, exactly.
   That's what fat people do.

493
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:47,118
      They make us laugh.

494
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,154
           -<i> Georgie,</i>
  <i> I think it's really positive</i>

495
00:34:50,156 --> 00:34:52,723
       that you're going
    to start dancing again.

496
00:34:52,725 --> 00:34:55,358
           What about
    also including SoulCycle

497
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,094
 in addition to the more gentle
         dance classes?

498
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:01,629
  <i> It would be amazing for you!</i>

499
00:35:01,631 --> 00:35:04,598
        -Georgie is not
       doing SoulCycle..

500
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,799
            ...ever.

501
00:35:05,801 --> 00:35:07,300
       -Seriously, maybe
         it's the time

502
00:35:07,302 --> 00:35:09,135
  to start investigating lipo.

503
00:35:09,137 --> 00:35:11,337
     My dad could give you
          a good deal.

504
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:13,372
     Your butt looks huge!
             -Aah!

505
00:35:13,374 --> 00:35:15,640
    -That is the first place
        you should lipo.

506
00:35:15,642 --> 00:35:17,441
    And then you can save it
     for when you get older

507
00:35:17,443 --> 00:35:18,775
      and then, hopefully,
       you can inject it

508
00:35:18,777 --> 00:35:21,010
  and improve your ugly face.

509
00:35:21,012 --> 00:35:24,079
        I mean, you are
 a plastic surgeon's wet dream.

510
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,681
      I mean, look at it.
  There's so much jiggly fat.

511
00:35:26,683 --> 00:35:28,215
    How can you be this fat
          at only 12?

512
00:35:28,217 --> 00:35:30,217
 I mean, where is this heading?

513
00:35:32,054 --> 00:35:34,220
   I'd cry too if I were you.

514
00:35:34,222 --> 00:35:35,888
         No, actually,
  I would just kill myself --

515
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,323
     -Cat, that's too far.
          Cut it out.

516
00:35:38,325 --> 00:35:39,991
      -Georgie, you should
          just kill --

517
00:35:39,993 --> 00:35:43,361
  -You stop bullying Georgie.
     You're being horrible!

518
00:35:43,363 --> 00:35:44,528
      -Are you kidding me?

519
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:45,929
   You were just bullying her
        and telling her

520
00:35:45,931 --> 00:35:47,397
  she had to go to SoulCycle!

521
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:51,266
       Seriously, Sophia,
   you are the biggest fool.

522
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:54,602
    You were also mean to me
       when my mom died.

523
00:35:54,604 --> 00:35:57,237
        -You really need
       to get over that.

524
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:00,106
     -Really? Get over it?

525
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:02,241
  I'd like to see you get over
      something like that.

526
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,543
     -Cat, enough! Get out!

527
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:06,311
  -What are you talking about?
    -That's it, I've had it!

528
00:36:06,313 --> 00:36:08,479
        You have to go!

529
00:36:08,481 --> 00:36:10,447
       <i> I called your car!</i>

530
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:12,582
      -Are you showing off
      for your new friend?

531
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:15,818
     -I'm gonna call my mom
    and get us a ride home.

532
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,220
      -No, I invited you.

533
00:36:18,222 --> 00:36:20,021
        Anyway, Georgie,
      you're such a poser!

534
00:36:20,023 --> 00:36:21,255
       All you do is eat.

535
00:36:21,257 --> 00:36:22,589
       That's why Sophia
       keeps you around.

536
00:36:22,591 --> 00:36:25,592
Next to you, she'll always look
     skinnier and prettier.

537
00:36:25,594 --> 00:36:26,993
    -What did you just say?
              -<i> Uh.</i>

538
00:36:26,995 --> 00:36:30,329
 -Cat! Really? Enough! Get out!

539
00:36:30,331 --> 00:36:33,265
       -You're seriously
        kicking me out?

540
00:36:33,267 --> 00:36:35,233
           I'm sorry!

541
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:37,335
We always say this stupid stuff
         to each other.

542
00:36:37,337 --> 00:36:40,504
  I really didn't mean to hurt
your feelings, Georgie, I swear.

543
00:36:40,506 --> 00:36:42,472
 -We'll see you tomorrow, okay?
            -Oh, no.

544
00:36:42,474 --> 00:36:43,840
         -Listen, Cat!
              -No.

545
00:36:43,842 --> 00:36:47,176
 -If I forgive you right away,
      you will never stop!

546
00:36:47,178 --> 00:36:51,045
 -Sophia, please let Cat stay.
  We were all just having fun.

547
00:36:52,414 --> 00:36:55,416
             Fine.
     If Cat goes, I go too.

548
00:36:55,418 --> 00:36:58,519
         -No, you stay.
       Don't you want to?

549
00:36:58,521 --> 00:37:00,420
      Cat, you have to go!

550
00:37:00,422 --> 00:37:01,954
          Please leave

551
00:37:01,956 --> 00:37:04,323
         when your host
       asks you politely.

552
00:37:04,325 --> 00:37:05,524
     -Please don't do this.

553
00:37:05,526 --> 00:37:07,359
I'm, I'm so sorry.

554
00:37:07,361 --> 00:37:08,360
     You don't understand.

555
00:37:08,362 --> 00:37:10,361
  I don't have anywhere to go!

556
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:13,830
        Are you coming?

557
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:17,799
           Forget it!

558
00:37:17,801 --> 00:37:19,000
        Just forget it!

559
00:37:39,116 --> 00:37:41,417
        -Guys, let's go
       touch all the art.

560
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:45,786
        -<i> Oh, my God! Oh.</i>

561
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,736
            -<i> Genius!</i>

562
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,253
         -I hate them!

563
00:39:07,156 --> 00:39:09,456
    I hate you, I hate you!

564
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:12,158
    I hate you! I hate you!

565
00:39:13,828 --> 00:39:15,828
          Oh, pick up.

566
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:18,263
    -<i> Hi, this is Dr. White,</i>
    <i> if this is an emergency</i>

567

   <i> please hang up and dial..</i>

568
00:39:19,633 --> 00:39:22,599
        -Mom would never
        screen my call!

569
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:27,769
    You never ever pick up!
         It's not fair!

570
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:33,940
           The girls
    were really mean to me.

571
00:39:36,477 --> 00:39:39,744
They kicked me out of the house.

572
00:39:39,746 --> 00:39:41,879
        Dad, I'm alone.

573
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:43,313
  I needed you to come get me.

574
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:48,384
    I don't know what to do.

575
00:39:49,252 --> 00:39:52,220
  I can't even see right now!

576
00:39:52,222 --> 00:39:55,589
    I can't take it anymore!
       I swear, I can't!

577
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,991
        Dad, I'm scared.

578
00:39:58,993 --> 00:40:00,592
           I'm sorry.

579
00:40:02,862 --> 00:40:05,095
           I'm sorry!

580
00:40:34,591 --> 00:40:36,591
          -<i> Ultra kill.</i>

00:40:45,267 --> 00:40:48,335
        -We could do it
   during the best time ever.

582
00:40:48,337 --> 00:40:49,769
     -I need to post this.

583
00:40:49,771 --> 00:40:52,004
   -<i> Oh, my God. Sam, that's,</i>
    <i> like, the best picture.</i>

      -<i> Oh, my God. Look at</i>
    <i> how many likes for that.</i>

586
00:41:00,245 --> 00:41:02,478
      -I'm gonna kill her.
           See, look.

587
00:41:03,446 --> 00:41:05,246
        -That's so sick.

588
00:41:05,248 --> 00:41:08,716
      -No matter what now,
      I'm always gonna be
     the fat tranny bitch.

589
00:41:08,718 --> 00:41:11,351
          I could look
   as skinny as Sophia's mom.

590
00:41:11,353 --> 00:41:15,321
  And when anyone looks me up,
they're gonna see this picture.

591
00:41:15,323 --> 00:41:18,290
      No matter what I do,
 I will always be the fat girl.

592
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:20,725
 Any boy who likes me is gonna
    look me up and see this.

593
00:41:20,727 --> 00:41:23,761
    -Georgie, she might have
     used a fat-ass, okay?

594
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,530
       -My life is over.
  I hate this, it's not fair.

595
00:41:27,532 --> 00:41:28,664
        -Shh. It's okay.

596
00:41:29,867 --> 00:41:31,733
       <i> Stop eating. Shh..</i>

597
00:41:33,236 --> 00:41:35,803
         -I can't stop.

598
00:41:35,805 --> 00:41:38,605
      It's the only thing
   that makes me feel better.

599
00:41:42,442 --> 00:41:46,844
   And it's really horrible,
           you guys.

600
00:41:46,846 --> 00:41:48,378
      I can't stop eating.

601
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,379
      -Yes, yes, you can.

602
00:41:52,515 --> 00:41:53,681
      -<i> What are you doing?</i>
           -<i> Georgie..</i>

603
00:41:53,683 --> 00:41:55,949
     Georgie, we are trying
          to help you.

604
00:41:55,951 --> 00:41:58,284
  I think you just have to go
  cold turkey. Just don't eat.

605
00:41:58,286 --> 00:41:59,952
 It doesn't make you feel good.

606
00:41:59,954 --> 00:42:01,219
         -<i> Why don't you</i>
       <i> look in the mirror</i>

607
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:02,520
     <i> and say the same thing</i>
          <i> to yourself?</i>

608
00:42:02,522 --> 00:42:04,622
      -Hey, come on, guys,
  we all have something we do

609
00:42:04,624 --> 00:42:07,391
 to get through the day, okay?
        Being 12 sucks.

610
00:42:07,393 --> 00:42:08,959
  Let's not make it any worse.

611
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:10,760
       And just be nice,
  we don't wanna be like Cat.

612
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:11,827
             -<i> Argh!</i>

613
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,095
      I'm going to stitch
         her mouth shut

614
00:42:14,097 --> 00:42:15,463
    and cut off her fingers

615
00:42:15,465 --> 00:42:17,598
      so she can't do this
        to anyone else.

616
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,099
   -Let's just enjoy the fact
   that she's not here, okay?

617
00:42:21,901 --> 00:42:25,169
     -Just enjoy the sounds
   like De -- Depeche Modes.

618
00:42:26,104 --> 00:42:28,905
       -Mode, you moron.

619
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,761
      -Can't you just stop
        looking at that?

620
00:42:51,763 --> 00:42:53,529
 Maybe turn it off for a while?

621
00:42:53,531 --> 00:42:56,198
Put it down. Can't you do that?

622
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,900
      -That's impossible!
      No one can do that.

623
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:07,674
             -Okay.
     Okay, I have an idea.

624
00:43:07,676 --> 00:43:11,077
    I dare us all to lock up
     our phone in the safe

625
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:13,112
until Sophia's mom gets home.

626
00:43:13,114 --> 00:43:14,446
   <i> This way I'll stop looking</i>
          <i> at my phone</i>

627
00:43:14,448 --> 00:43:17,315
   <i> and this horrible picture.</i>

628
00:43:17,317 --> 00:43:18,516
    -You know what, Georgie?
            -<i> Mm-hmm?</i>

629
00:43:18,518 --> 00:43:20,851
          -I actually
    agree with you for once.

630
00:43:20,853 --> 00:43:23,186
   -Yeah, then we can hangout
        with each other.

631
00:43:23,188 --> 00:43:24,987
 And we won't be on our phones
         all the time.

632
00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:26,788
           -Oh, God!

633
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:28,389
         Like, lock up
      our phones for real?

634
00:43:28,391 --> 00:43:30,157
             -<i> Yeah.</i>

635
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:31,791
        -I just, I think
        that's not safe.

636
00:43:31,793 --> 00:43:34,059
     You guys just moved in
       and you don't have
     a landline yet, right?

637
00:43:34,061 --> 00:43:36,795
       -But, like, no one
    has a landline anymore.

638
00:43:44,636 --> 00:43:46,503
 -But I can't lock my phone in
 the safe. My mom might call --

639
00:43:46,505 --> 00:43:49,639
 -Your mom is not calling you!
     She knows you're here.

640
00:43:49,641 --> 00:43:51,507
     She knows you're fine,
          so come on.

641
00:43:51,509 --> 00:43:54,209
     Don't be such a pussy,
 and put your phone in the safe

642
00:43:54,211 --> 00:43:56,878
 so Georgie doesn't have to be
     cyberbullied anymore.

643
00:44:09,388 --> 00:44:11,222
     -<i> Okay, I have an idea.</i>

644
00:44:11,224 --> 00:44:15,025
     <i> I dare us all to lock</i>

645
00:44:18,562 --> 00:44:21,063

 <i> safe. You guys just moved in..</i>

00:44:21,065 --> 00:44:22,597
 -<i> But I can't lock my phone in</i>

649
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,181
           -You know
     where you threw that?

650
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:45,283
             -<i> Nope.</i>

651
00:44:45,285 --> 00:44:47,818
        -Wow! So weird.

652
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:50,719
       -I wanna go home.

653
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:54,989
    -<i> You guys want a drink?</i>

654
00:44:54,991 --> 00:44:56,190
             -Yes!

655
00:45:03,798 --> 00:45:06,399

00:45:10,536 --> 00:45:11,702
             -Hey.

660
00:45:19,744 --> 00:45:21,009
            -Ready.

661
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:29,549
      -Guys, why don't we
      just dance instead?

662
00:45:29,551 --> 00:45:31,150
   -<i> Yeah, that's a good idea.</i>
          <i> Let's dance.</i>

663
00:45:31,152 --> 00:45:33,785
 -Let's dance with our drinks.
             -<i> Guys.</i>

664
00:45:33,787 --> 00:45:35,787
             -Okay.

00:45:55,872 --> 00:45:58,038
      -Sam, are you okay?

666
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,539
   -I'm, I'm good, I'm great.

676
00:46:25,494 --> 00:46:28,228
   -Uh, Francesca, go ahead.

677
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:29,696
 -The thing that you just did?

678
00:46:29,698 --> 00:46:31,564
   -Sure, just -- just dance.

679
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,133
            -Yeah..

680
00:46:39,504 --> 00:46:40,669
         -Honey, honey.

681
00:46:42,205 --> 00:46:45,272
           <i> I do not.</i>
    <i> You look like a pirate.</i>

682
00:46:45,274 --> 00:46:47,073
- I don't look like that.

683
00:46:47,075 --> 00:46:48,074
            -Quiet.

684
00:46:48,076 --> 00:46:50,609
 -You have to express yourself.

685
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:54,479
    -<i> Express yourself, Ava.</i>

686
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:56,214
       <i> Express yourself.</i>

687
00:46:56,216 --> 00:46:58,416
     -Wait a minute, guys,
         I speak bird.

688
00:47:02,154 --> 00:47:05,989
       -Can you open him?
          -Sure. Yeah.

689
00:47:05,991 --> 00:47:09,359
        -Come here. Rio.

690
00:47:09,361 --> 00:47:10,893
         -Rio, be good.

691
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:14,029
         -Put it back.

692
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:16,498
  -<i> Guys, I think that's enough</i>
         <i> for now, okay?</i>

693
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:21,034
We can talk to him later. Okay?

694
00:47:21,036 --> 00:47:23,702
   -I'm gonna marry the bird.
       -Mommy loves you.

695
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,420
   -Sophia, this is awesome!

696
00:47:46,422 --> 00:47:48,955
       -<i> This is so cool.</i>

697
00:47:48,957 --> 00:47:50,289
       <i> Is this the movie?</i>

698
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:54,025
    -It's one of the, like,
    movies my mom just had.

699
00:47:54,027 --> 00:47:56,160
   I have no idea what it is.

700
00:48:08,771 --> 00:48:10,671
  -So what do you want to do?

701
00:48:10,673 --> 00:48:14,107
  -Well, there's nothing to do
    without our phones, so..

702
00:48:14,109 --> 00:48:15,875
     -I mean, I would say,
      we could look it up

703
00:48:15,877 --> 00:48:17,610
  but we don't have our phones
        to look it up..

704
00:48:18,713 --> 00:48:20,179
      -Let's tell secrets.
             -Yeah.

705
00:48:20,181 --> 00:48:22,247
             -<i> Yeah.</i>
     -Like an honesty game.

706
00:48:22,249 --> 00:48:23,748
        Let's be honest
       about everything.

707
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:24,882
              -<i> Oh?</i>

708
00:48:26,284 --> 00:48:29,418
        -Okay. How about
 when did you get your period?

709
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,087
             -<i> Umm..</i>

710
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:38,124
      <i> I got mine last year</i>
        <i> at summer camp.</i>

711
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:41,293
        <i> It was so weird.</i>

712
00:48:41,295 --> 00:48:44,629
     We were in the courts
          and suddenly

713
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:47,098
  there was all of this blood
       in my white skirt.

714
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,202
        And when I went
    to reach down to fix it

715
00:48:51,204 --> 00:48:53,337
   it got all over my hand..

716
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,007
   ...and the girls called me
          Bloody Mary.

717
00:49:01,311 --> 00:49:06,048
      But when I got home,
    my mom...got really mad

718
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:10,218
      <i> and she told me that</i>
   <i> I got my period too early</i>

719
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,219
        <i> and that I need</i>
    <i> to stop eating chicken.</i>

720
00:49:13,988 --> 00:49:16,489
    But I don't eat chicken.

721
00:49:16,491 --> 00:49:17,990
           I'm vegan.

722
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,660
        I mean, how does
       she not know that?

723
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:27,397
          -<i> My mom too,</i>
   <i> she keeps trying to help..</i>

724
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:32,301
 ...but all she does is tell me
  everything I'm doing wrong.

725
00:49:33,803 --> 00:49:35,804
         All the time.

726
00:49:38,974 --> 00:49:41,375
         Wrong for who?

727
00:49:41,377 --> 00:49:43,744
            For her?

728
00:49:43,746 --> 00:49:46,113
        -I hate my mom.

729
00:49:46,115 --> 00:49:49,883
   My parents were fighting,
      like, all the time.

730
00:49:52,586 --> 00:49:55,521
    I was going to run away.

731
00:49:55,523 --> 00:49:59,924
      I mean, I can model
        in Paris at 13.

732
00:49:59,926 --> 00:50:03,494
 Did you know you can even get
  married there legally at 15?

733
00:50:06,231 --> 00:50:08,899
        I was gonna sell
   some of my mom's jewelry.

734
00:50:08,901 --> 00:50:10,901
         It's not like
     she would even notice.

735
00:50:10,903 --> 00:50:13,169
     All she does is shop.

736
00:50:13,171 --> 00:50:15,971
       And then she goes
    to these lame meetings.

737
00:50:15,973 --> 00:50:18,940
  She's not even really sober,
       so I don't get it.

738
00:50:18,942 --> 00:50:20,941
        So why even go?

739
00:50:22,643 --> 00:50:24,644
  It's like she's a bad joke.

740
00:50:26,313 --> 00:50:28,747
         Why can't they
    just be normal parents?

741
00:50:33,352 --> 00:50:35,920
    -<i> At least you see them.</i>

742
00:50:35,922 --> 00:50:38,622
   My parents don't even know
        I exist anymore.

743
00:50:43,394 --> 00:50:45,394
  And they work all the time.

744
00:50:47,263 --> 00:50:49,264
       <i> I'm always alone.</i>

745
00:50:50,633 --> 00:50:52,734
      <i> I hate being alone.</i>

746
00:50:54,403 --> 00:50:59,272
      <i> When they are home,</i>
    <i> they're on their phones.</i>

747
00:50:59,274 --> 00:51:02,240
      <i> So I don't even know</i>
        <i> why they bother.</i>

748
00:51:04,676 --> 00:51:08,812
        They're like...
       real-life zombies.

749
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,251
          I hate them.

750
00:51:23,827 --> 00:51:26,395
      -Okay, now something
         happy, please.

751
00:51:29,766 --> 00:51:32,300
           -Oh, yeah.
     I kissed Christopher.

752
00:51:33,335 --> 00:51:36,503
          -Oh, my God.
         -It was weird.

753
00:51:40,373 --> 00:51:43,942
I mean, the kiss was not weird.

754
00:51:43,944 --> 00:51:46,044
  His tongue in my mouth was.

755
00:51:47,414 --> 00:51:48,813
            -I know.

756
00:51:48,815 --> 00:51:52,816
         The first time
       is kind of freaky.

757
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,819
       -Yeah. Didn't know
       what he was doing.

758
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:59,222
  -He probably didn't either.
        -I know, right?

759
00:51:59,224 --> 00:52:02,024
          It felt like
   he was cleaning my teeth.

760
00:52:03,394 --> 00:52:05,394
             -Eww!
       -It was so gross.

761
00:52:08,498 --> 00:52:10,599
     -What about you, Sam?

762
00:52:11,567 --> 00:52:13,568
   -I've done more than that.

763
00:52:14,703 --> 00:52:16,704
       -What do you mean?

764
00:52:17,906 --> 00:52:21,341
     -I, you know, did it.

765
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:23,876
             -<i> Eww!</i>

766
00:52:32,118 --> 00:52:34,518
        -<i> I hate my mom.</i>

767
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,286
     -<i> I kissed Christopher.</i>

768
00:52:36,288 --> 00:52:39,289
     -<i> I, you know, did it.</i>

769
00:52:51,866 --> 00:52:55,301
         -<i> A 1 and a 2.</i>
       <i> And a 1, 2, 3, 4.</i>

770
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:51,918
  -Come on, Sam, it's so nice.

771
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,487
    -I'm just a little cold.
           I'm okay.

772
00:53:55,455 --> 00:53:57,556
       -<i> Come on, come in.</i>

773
00:53:57,558 --> 00:53:59,190
           -I'm fine.

774
00:54:04,128 --> 00:54:05,795
        -What happened?

775
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:10,098
       -It was really bad
       at my last school.

776
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,800
  All my friends turned on me.

777
00:54:12,802 --> 00:54:15,469
 <i> It was just really bad, okay?</i>

778
00:54:15,471 --> 00:54:17,470
  <i> I don't wanna talk about it.</i>

779
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:23,175
 Let's just turn some music on.

780
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:25,610
  It's too quiet. It's creepy.

781
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:44,639
          Who is that?

782
00:55:45,607 --> 00:55:47,474
   -Who else knows your code?

783
00:56:00,519 --> 00:56:03,353
      -Where's Cat? Where?

784
00:56:04,388 --> 00:56:05,755
              Cat!

785
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:09,124
         Where is she?
           -<i> She left.</i>

786
00:56:09,126 --> 00:56:11,559
      -When? How long ago?

787
00:56:11,561 --> 00:56:14,295
     -<i> Uh, half an hour ago.</i>
             -Cat!

788
00:56:23,371 --> 00:56:25,772
- <i> They kicked me</i>
       <i> out of the house.</i>

789
00:56:27,609 --> 00:56:30,142
  <i> I can't even see right now.</i>

790
00:56:30,144 --> 00:56:34,012
    <i> I can't take it anymore!</i>
        <i> I swear I can't!</i>

791
00:56:34,014 --> 00:56:35,713
        <i> Dad, I'm scared.</i>

792
00:56:35,715 --> 00:56:39,282
  -Why is my daughter crying?

793
00:56:39,284 --> 00:56:41,050
       She's hysterical!

794
00:56:41,052 --> 00:56:44,820
       -Nothing happened,
        Dr. White, okay?

795
00:56:44,822 --> 00:56:47,422
     -<i> Cat wanted to leave.</i>
     -<i> Where's your mother?</i>

796
00:56:47,424 --> 00:56:49,323
 <i> I need to speak to your mother</i>
       <i> about the bullying</i>

797
00:56:49,325 --> 00:56:52,659
   that my daughter has been
   subjected to here tonight.

798
00:56:52,661 --> 00:56:54,894
        -She's a bully.
        She made me cry.

799
00:56:54,896 --> 00:56:56,528
  She told me to kill myself!

800
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:58,263
       -It's good advice.

801
00:56:58,265 --> 00:56:59,964
              Cat!

802
00:56:59,966 --> 00:57:02,832
  Cat, come on, where are you?
           Cat? Cat?

803
00:57:05,468 --> 00:57:07,602
           Cat? Cat?

804
00:57:11,105 --> 00:57:12,572
              Cat?

805
00:57:14,775 --> 00:57:17,409
   I don't know who the fuck
   to believe right now, okay

806
00:57:17,411 --> 00:57:19,978
       until we find Cat.

807
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,746
       I can't fucking go
      through this again.

808
00:57:21,748 --> 00:57:23,481
   Did she leave with Bennet?
              -<i> No.</i>

809
00:57:23,483 --> 00:57:25,182
    -We don't know a Bennet!
              -No.

810
00:57:25,184 --> 00:57:27,184
      -I know she's here!

811
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:32,255
        Are you perhaps
   covering up for her maybe?

812
00:57:32,257 --> 00:57:35,091
     Maybe you did sort of
      a -- a secret swear?

813
00:57:35,093 --> 00:57:38,360
  Uh, uh, pinky -- pinky swear
         kind of thing?

814
00:57:38,362 --> 00:57:40,528
              -No.
              -No.

815
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:42,029
          -Come here.

816
00:57:42,031 --> 00:57:43,697
           Come here.

817
00:57:43,699 --> 00:57:45,231
           Come here.

818
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,933
  Did she leave with Bennett?

819
00:57:48,935 --> 00:57:51,168
            -No, no.
         -No? You sure?

820
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:52,903
             -Hmm.
           -You sure?

821
00:57:52,905 --> 00:57:54,771
              Cat!

822
00:57:54,773 --> 00:57:56,105
              Cat!

823
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,473
              <i> Cat!</i>

824
00:57:59,508 --> 00:58:01,509
     Cat, I won't be angry.

825
00:58:02,811 --> 00:58:04,812
  You're not in trouble, Cat.

826
00:58:14,021 --> 00:58:16,889
    You been drinking, huh?
    Have you been drinking?

827
00:58:16,891 --> 00:58:18,023
              -No.
              -Uh?

828
00:58:18,025 --> 00:58:19,224
              -No.
 -Yes, you have been drinking.

829
00:58:19,226 --> 00:58:21,192
        -Leave us alone.
     -You've been drinking?

830
00:58:21,194 --> 00:58:23,561
          Haven't you?
     You've been drinking.

831
00:58:23,563 --> 00:58:24,962
          Haven't you?
    Have you been drinking?

832
00:58:24,964 --> 00:58:26,396
              -No.
          -You're 12!

833
00:58:26,398 --> 00:58:28,630
     You've been drinking,
          all of you!

834
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:35,201
    <i> A bunch of 12 year olds</i>
           <i> drinking.</i>

835
00:58:35,203 --> 00:58:37,069
 -<i> Dr. White, it was my mother.</i>

836
00:58:37,071 --> 00:58:40,005
        -Fucking believe
       anything you say?

837
00:58:40,007 --> 00:58:42,007
       You're all drunk!

838
00:58:43,242 --> 00:58:45,910
       I mean, something
  could have happened to her!

839
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,281
  Why would you let her leave?

840
00:58:51,883 --> 00:58:54,818
   Why didn't anyone call me?

841
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:56,819
        I could've come
       and picked her up!

842
00:58:58,955 --> 00:59:01,823
       All you care about
     is yourselves, right?

843
00:59:01,825 --> 00:59:04,225
      It's -- it's easier
        that way, right?

844
00:59:04,227 --> 00:59:05,893
 It's fucking easier that way!

845
00:59:05,895 --> 00:59:09,263
       Do you give a shit
     about anybody, do you?

846
00:59:09,265 --> 00:59:12,065
   Do you care about anyone?

847
00:59:12,067 --> 00:59:14,067
 -Really, swear she went home.

848
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:18,704
       -Are you an idiot?
      She didn't go home.
       I was just there.

849
00:59:18,706 --> 00:59:20,706
       What part of that
     do you not understand?

850
00:59:29,115 --> 00:59:31,583
        You're smiling.
      Why are you smiling?

851
00:59:31,585 --> 00:59:33,484
       -I'm not smiling.
     -Why are you smiling?

852
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:35,886
          -I'm not --
         -Where is she?

853
00:59:38,923 --> 00:59:41,791
         Little bitches
    are capable of anything.

854
00:59:41,793 --> 00:59:43,292
  <i> Do you remember what you did</i>
       <i> to her last time?</i>

855
00:59:43,294 --> 00:59:45,294
 <i> I should have pressed charges.</i>

856
00:59:46,229 --> 00:59:48,229
      -We're sorry, okay?

857
00:59:50,498 --> 00:59:52,532
   -<i> You know, you should all</i>
     <i> be institutionalized.</i>

858
00:59:52,534 --> 00:59:54,534
     -I'll go look for her.

859
00:59:58,371 --> 01:00:01,840
         -It's so sick.
       It's just so sick.

860
01:00:01,842 --> 01:00:03,041
        <i> You know, really</i>
    <i> when you think about it</i>

861
01:00:03,043 --> 01:00:04,976
  it's pretty sick, isn't it?

862
01:00:04,978 --> 01:00:07,945
          The only way
      to get to you guys..

863
01:00:07,947 --> 01:00:10,614
      The only way to get
    to your little demented

864
01:00:10,616 --> 01:00:13,750
 squirrelled up little heads..

865
01:00:19,022 --> 01:00:21,456
     The only way to scare
          your selfish

866
01:00:21,458 --> 01:00:23,858
   spoiled and corrupt minds

867
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:26,093
is to scare the shit out of you.

868
01:00:26,095 --> 01:00:27,894
     Little stunted brains.

869
01:00:29,464 --> 01:00:30,729
         Get back here!

870
01:00:31,765 --> 01:00:33,531
         Get back here!

871
01:00:38,035 --> 01:00:40,770
Now it's just us, right?

872
01:00:40,772 --> 01:00:42,905
     Why don't we just talk
      about things, okay?

873
01:00:42,907 --> 01:00:44,339
     Why don't we just talk
       about this calmly?

874
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:48,109
    -You put that knife down
    and leave this instant!

875
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:49,777
   <i> I'm gonna call the police.</i>
         <i> This is crazy.</i>

01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:51,578
  <i> You can't treat us this way!</i>

877
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,413
        And if you think
     my mother isn't going

878
01:00:53,415 --> 01:00:55,882
 to have my back, you're wrong.

879
01:00:55,884 --> 01:00:58,551
     You messed her tits up
       and she's pissed.

880
01:01:03,157 --> 01:01:04,656
             -Cat?

881
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,260
           Come back.

882
01:01:11,061 --> 01:01:13,062
    Your dad's freaking out.

883
01:01:38,755 --> 01:01:40,989
      -You're all damaged,
         damaged goods.

884
01:01:44,727 --> 01:01:48,528
     Listen, listen to me.
         Listen to me.

885
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:50,930
 If my daughter doesn't call me
        within the hour

886
01:01:50,932 --> 01:01:52,931
   I'm gonna call the police.

887
01:01:55,267 --> 01:01:58,102
     And you all are gonna
     be charged as adults.

888
01:01:58,104 --> 01:02:00,971
       Do you understand?
            Do you?

889
01:02:00,973 --> 01:02:03,306
    Do you understand, huh?

890
01:02:27,328 --> 01:02:29,228
      -He's such a creep.

891
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:41,038
  -God, how creepy is Whitey.

892
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,540
    I can't believe your mom
     really hit that shit.

893
01:02:43,542 --> 01:02:45,975
  -What kind of father follows
   their own daughter online?

894
01:02:45,977 --> 01:02:48,310
      -One that rapes her.

895
01:02:48,312 --> 01:02:51,246
       Did you guys hear
       what he just said?

896
01:02:51,248 --> 01:02:53,914
       Charged as adults.
         -Where is Cat?

897
01:02:55,049 --> 01:02:56,616
       Is she hurt and..

898
01:02:56,618 --> 01:02:58,651
  ...why didn't her weird dad
        call the police?

899
01:02:58,653 --> 01:03:00,185
         -He's so rich.

900
01:03:00,187 --> 01:03:01,853
    He doesn't have to call
          the police.

901
01:03:01,855 --> 01:03:03,120
      He owns the police.

902
01:03:03,122 --> 01:03:05,889
       -If he's so rich,
  why does he dress like that?

903
01:03:05,891 --> 01:03:07,890
     He looks like Hitler.

904
01:03:10,059 --> 01:03:12,260
  Your mom slept with Hitler.

905
01:03:14,464 --> 01:03:16,330
      <i> Eww, your mom slept</i>
          <i> with Hitler.</i>

906
01:03:16,332 --> 01:03:19,066
        -Stop it, guys.
     It's not funny, okay?

907
01:03:19,068 --> 01:03:20,367
           Not funny.

908
01:03:20,369 --> 01:03:22,369
      Not the right time,
          you got it?

909
01:03:22,371 --> 01:03:24,704
      Not the right time.
     -<i> Oh, my God, you guys.</i>

910
01:03:24,706 --> 01:03:27,239
 I just saw a car in the woods
and the windows are all bloody.

911
01:03:27,241 --> 01:03:30,675
    I don't know what to do.
      It's a red Ferrari.

912
01:03:30,677 --> 01:03:32,076
     -That's my dad's car.

913
01:03:32,078 --> 01:03:34,445
      You're lying again!
        -I'm not lying!

914
01:03:34,447 --> 01:03:37,114
         -You're acting
   like you're a liar, okay?

915
01:03:37,116 --> 01:03:39,115
 And your stories are pathetic!

916
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:43,318
     You're fucked up, Sam.

917
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,119
 You lied about where you live

918
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:46,820
            <i> you lied</i>
     <i> about being a princess</i>

919
01:03:46,822 --> 01:03:49,689
 <i> and you lied about having sex.</i>

920
01:03:49,691 --> 01:03:51,590
    <i> You're seriously mental.</i>

921
01:03:51,592 --> 01:03:54,192
        -<i> Are you, like,</i>
     <i> not taking your meds?</i>

922
01:03:54,194 --> 01:03:57,061
          -That's it.
      You have to go. Now!

923
01:04:04,369 --> 01:04:06,837
     Where the fuck is Ava?

924
01:04:06,839 --> 01:04:09,773
         -I don't know.
     Who knows? Who cares?

925
01:04:15,279 --> 01:04:17,480
  Your mom slept with Hitler.

926
01:04:19,784 --> 01:04:22,184
     I don't really know..

927
01:04:23,186 --> 01:04:26,188
       Slept with Hitler.
            -Hitler!

928
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:33,894
      -For the last time,
        it's not funny!
         -With Hitler.

01:04:33,896 --> 01:04:35,528
  -Your mom slept with Hitler.

  -Your mom slept with Hitler.
  -<i> Your mom slept with Hitler.</i>

931
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,000
     -Where are you going?
  -To get away from you guys.

932
01:04:42,002 --> 01:04:44,235
     You guys are assholes.

933
01:04:44,237 --> 01:04:46,470
 I can't believe you're saying
      this stuff about me

934
01:04:46,472 --> 01:04:48,605
      and in my own house
        about my mother.

935
01:04:49,874 --> 01:04:51,640
           Whatever.

936
01:04:51,642 --> 01:04:53,108
     I'm gonna go find Cat.

937
01:04:53,110 --> 01:04:56,311
 And if she isn't already dead,
      I'm gonna kill her.

938
01:04:57,813 --> 01:05:00,314
    -You can't leave us here
      without our phones.

939
01:05:00,316 --> 01:05:01,815
            Sophia!

940
01:05:06,954 --> 01:05:08,753
        Selfish bitches!

941
01:05:26,571 --> 01:05:29,839
  -Jesus fucking Christ, Alex!
            Jesus..

942
01:05:29,841 --> 01:05:32,107
    How did you leave the --
the kids unsupervised like that

943
01:05:32,109 --> 01:05:34,709
 after what happened last year?
        Come on, really?

944
01:05:34,711 --> 01:05:38,045
  What -- what are you doing?
          -Calm down!

945
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,013
Just take it easy.

946
01:05:40,015 --> 01:05:42,548
        Michael, relax.
         Breathe, okay?

947
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:45,217
 They're just 12-year-old girls
  having some silly melodrama.

948
01:05:45,219 --> 01:05:46,952
  I'm sure they'll get over it
          in a minute.
        -Your fucking..

949
01:05:46,954 --> 01:05:49,387
     Your -- your daughter
   and her fucked up friends

950
01:05:49,389 --> 01:05:51,455
     have kicked Catherine
       out of the house.

951
01:05:51,457 --> 01:05:52,722
      That's what's going
         on now, okay?

952
01:05:52,724 --> 01:05:54,123
            -Look --
     -Now I can't find her
           anywhere!

953
01:05:54,125 --> 01:05:56,325
She's not at my house, she's not
  at yours and I'm concerned!

954
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:58,193
        -Shh! Calm down!

955
01:05:58,195 --> 01:06:00,395
   I'm sure Cat is just fine.

956
01:06:00,397 --> 01:06:02,697
 Listen to me. I'm taking care
      of myself right now.

957
01:06:02,699 --> 01:06:04,398
     It's just for an hour
          and a half.

958
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,666
       The girls are 12.
   They're almost teenagers.

959
01:06:06,668 --> 01:06:08,401
    They're fine home alone
          for an hour.

960
01:06:08,403 --> 01:06:09,568
   They're not wild animals.

961
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:10,802
      -And you're correct,
      they're not animals.

962
01:06:10,804 --> 01:06:12,403
 They're fucking beasts, okay?

963
01:06:12,405 --> 01:06:14,171
    And they have, you know,
       they've humiliated

964
01:06:14,173 --> 01:06:16,173
     and bullied Catherine
    to such a severe degree

965
01:06:16,175 --> 01:06:17,908
      that I'm gonna press
      charges against you.

966
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:20,043
        -You have to let
       this go, Michael.

967
01:06:20,045 --> 01:06:22,545
      Remember the light?
      Absolute certainty.

968
01:06:22,547 --> 01:06:24,813
         -Jesus Christ.
 -You can make anything happen.

969
01:06:24,815 --> 01:06:26,981
       Just be positive.
         Manifest this.

970
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:30,184
    -Your spiritual bullshit
  is not gonna work now, Alex!

971
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:31,885
 -I think that you should come
    to the meeting with me.

972
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:33,753
Surrender, give yourself over --

973
01:06:33,755 --> 01:06:36,722
    -This is fucking insane!

974
01:06:36,724 --> 01:06:39,458
    You -- you are much more
     of a fucking nightmare
     than you've ever been.

975
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:41,026
     You've just turned out
   to be a fucking...complete

976
01:06:41,028 --> 01:06:43,261
 useless, fucking human being!

977
01:06:44,463 --> 01:06:47,398
       And if I were you,
   I would just kill myself.

978
01:06:48,633 --> 01:06:50,200
       -You're a fucking
         control freak.

979
01:06:50,202 --> 01:06:53,136
   You can't handle anything
       real that happens.

980
01:06:53,138 --> 01:06:54,871
   Listen, Michael, I'm gonna
      go back inside there

981
01:06:54,873 --> 01:06:56,205
    and take care of myself.

982
01:06:56,207 --> 01:06:58,407
 When it's over, I will go home
     and I will try my best

983
01:06:58,409 --> 01:07:00,242
        to help you find
    your fucked up daughter!

984
01:07:00,244 --> 01:07:03,144
    -Don't you fucking talk
      about her that way.

985
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:07,181
  -Did you ever stop to think
 that maybe she's so fucked up

986
01:07:07,183 --> 01:07:08,815
        because you are?

987
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:12,985
 -If you -- if you ever fucking
   talk again to me like that

988
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:15,687
    I will fucking kill you.

989
01:07:15,689 --> 01:07:19,190
    -Hmm. I'm trying to have
   compassion for you, okay?

990
01:07:19,192 --> 01:07:21,392
      For your confusion.

991
01:07:21,394 --> 01:07:23,727
'Cause your daughter's missing.
       Your wife is dead.

992
01:07:23,729 --> 01:07:25,728
  You're taking it out on me.

993
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:29,864
  You're a sick, twisted fuck!

994
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:44,277
 -It's not real. It's not real.
        It wasn't real.

995
01:07:44,279 --> 01:07:46,412
  It wasn't -- it wasn't real.

996
01:07:49,549 --> 01:07:50,848
             Okay.

997
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:52,850
    I'm -- I'm at the sink.

998
01:07:54,285 --> 01:07:56,286
     The faucet is silver.

999
01:07:56,288 --> 01:07:58,288
    The floor is blue tile.

1000
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:01,224
I..

1001
01:08:01,226 --> 01:08:04,293
I am safe and nothing is wrong.

1002
01:08:05,862 --> 01:08:08,463
I'm in Connecticut..

1003
01:08:10,399 --> 01:08:13,100
   ...at Sophia Cox's house.

1004
01:08:13,102 --> 01:08:15,102
       I don't know why.

1005
01:08:18,873 --> 01:08:21,174
       I don't know why.

1006
01:08:33,352 --> 01:08:35,119
        It wasn't real.

1007
01:08:35,121 --> 01:08:36,887
 It wasn't real. It's not real.

1008
01:08:36,889 --> 01:08:38,889
         It's not real.

1009
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,869
         It's not real.
      None of it is real.

1010
01:09:09,618 --> 01:09:12,019
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean
     to freak everyone out.

1011
01:09:12,021 --> 01:09:14,587
I just thought I saw something.

1012
01:09:16,122 --> 01:09:18,056
   -What if that crazy story
            is true

1013
01:09:18,058 --> 01:09:20,691
    and that artist's ghost
      is still out there?

1014
01:09:21,926 --> 01:09:23,293
 Should someone go with Sophia?

1015
01:09:23,295 --> 01:09:26,095
    -No, it's not our fault.

1016
01:09:26,097 --> 01:09:28,397
    I don't really feel like
   I have to go find a freak.

1017
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:31,733
    I personally don't care
         what happens.

1018
01:09:31,735 --> 01:09:34,802
         -All you care
     about is eating cake.

1019
01:09:34,804 --> 01:09:36,236
       -Why don't you eat
        once in a while

1020
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,738
       and stop worrying
        about what I do?

1021
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:40,573
       -And what is that
       supposed to mean?

1022
01:09:40,575 --> 01:09:42,875
       -Nothing. Cupcake?

1023
01:09:46,846 --> 01:09:48,680
    So why did you lie, Sam?

1024
01:09:48,682 --> 01:09:51,449
          -<i> About what?</i>
       -About having sex.

1025
01:09:51,451 --> 01:09:53,951
        -Why would I lie
   about something like that?

1026
01:09:53,953 --> 01:09:55,953
  -'Cause you're just doing it
       to get attention.

1027
01:09:57,689 --> 01:10:00,556
      -Georgie, chill out.
      Eat another cupcake.

1028
01:10:03,192 --> 01:10:06,093
  -What are you talking about?
   I wouldn't lie like that.

1029
01:10:08,362 --> 01:10:12,097
     -Well, it's just that
       when I look at you

1030
01:10:12,099 --> 01:10:14,099
    I just don't believe it.

1031
01:10:18,637 --> 01:10:21,505
       What else are you
       lying about, huh?

1032
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:40,521
    -Cat, you gotta pick up
        when you sent me

1033
01:10:40,523 --> 01:10:43,223
         a text message
     saying you were lost!

1034
01:10:43,225 --> 01:10:44,991
      Well, I'm here now!

1035
01:10:44,993 --> 01:10:46,759
    We can't do this, right?
      You remember, honey?

1036
01:10:46,761 --> 01:10:49,128
  Remember? We're not gonna do
   this again to each other.

1037
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:50,629
    You're not gonna put me
         through this.

1038
01:10:50,631 --> 01:10:52,931
    Dr. Hutchins said we can
    work this out together.

1039
01:10:52,933 --> 01:10:54,866
  This is what we're gonna do.
  Work it out together, okay?

1040
01:10:54,868 --> 01:10:56,167
    Honey, I can't do this.

1041
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:57,735
        We gotta do this
       together, alright?

1042
01:10:57,737 --> 01:10:59,503
We gotta do this together, okay?

1043
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,638
     Okay, just me and you.
         We're a team.

1044
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,640
   Cat, goddamn it, call me!

1045
01:11:03,642 --> 01:11:06,775
   You have to. You have to.
          You have to.

1046
01:11:09,078 --> 01:11:10,445
              Cat!

1047
01:11:11,814 --> 01:11:14,515
           Cat! Cat!

1048
01:11:14,517 --> 01:11:16,483
        Kitty kitty Cat!

1049
01:11:16,485 --> 01:11:19,319
    Come on, I got some soup
     and a sandwich for ya.

1050
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:21,387
We'll go to Peterson's, come on!

1051
01:11:21,389 --> 01:11:23,188
      Hey, I'm right here!

1052
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:26,424
       Come on, bitches!
       Come on down here!

1053
01:11:26,426 --> 01:11:28,659
   We're gonna build a trap.

1054
01:11:30,628 --> 01:11:32,729
   We're gonna build a trap.

1055
01:11:32,731 --> 01:11:34,330
       I'm gonna trap you
     like a fucking animal.

1056
01:11:34,332 --> 01:11:35,497
    You're a fucking bitch.

1057
01:11:35,499 --> 01:11:38,700
     I'm just gonna get you
         right in here.

1058
01:11:38,702 --> 01:11:40,201
You act like an animal

1059
01:11:40,203 --> 01:11:41,702
       I should treat you
     like a fucking animal.

1060
01:11:41,704 --> 01:11:43,804
     Cat honey, over here!

1061
01:11:43,806 --> 01:11:46,273
 Come here, kitty kitty kitty.

1062
01:11:46,275 --> 01:11:48,208
You can't fucking do this to me.

1063
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:50,076
     You invite your little
     fucking friends over.

1064
01:11:50,078 --> 01:11:51,777
        You have -- have
        a nice reunion.

1065
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:53,511
Yeah.

1066
01:12:04,387 --> 01:12:05,853
             -Dad!

1067
01:12:08,189 --> 01:12:09,522
              Dad?

1068
01:12:10,757 --> 01:12:12,290
              Dad?

1069
01:12:22,398 --> 01:12:23,531
              Dad?

1070
01:12:25,134 --> 01:12:26,800
            No! No!

1071
01:12:40,548 --> 01:12:42,247
            -Great.
        -What is it now?

1072
01:12:42,249 --> 01:12:44,082
          -It's Harry.
          -Answer it.

1073
01:12:44,084 --> 01:12:46,684
              -No.
       -Alex, answer it.

1074
01:12:46,686 --> 01:12:49,086
      Take control, okay?
        It's your life.

1075
01:12:49,088 --> 01:12:50,987
       It's not his life.

1076
01:12:50,989 --> 01:12:52,989
          Pick it up.
             -Okay.

1077
01:12:54,891 --> 01:12:57,492
  Listen, Harry, I don't care
      that you're fucking
       your art advisor.

1078
01:12:57,494 --> 01:12:59,594
         I do care that
 you're calling me right after.

1079
01:12:59,596 --> 01:13:01,896
I don't wanna hear from you ever
  again, do you understand me?

1080
01:13:01,898 --> 01:13:04,331
 I'm through with you! Goodbye!

1081
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:06,099
- Mom?

1082
01:13:06,101 --> 01:13:07,233
             <i> Hello!</i>
