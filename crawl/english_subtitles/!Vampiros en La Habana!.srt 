2
00:00:21,185 --> 00:00:26,105
The history of the vampires is lost
in the distance of the remote times.

3
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:32,465
But only in 1870,
they started to organize.

4
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:38,665
Immigrant vampires got together in
Chicago to form the Capa Nostra Society.

5
00:00:39,585 --> 00:00:41,570
President: Johnny Terrori.

6
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,690
In Europe they created the Vampire
Group, with seat in Düsseldorf.

7
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,210
The first president ever elected
there was the legendary Count Dracula.

8
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,970
One of his sons, the young
scientist Bernerd Amadeus,

9
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,275
was working to find a formula to
allow vampires to be resistant to sunlight.

10
00:01:08,795 --> 00:01:12,075
After experimenting long and
patiently with dog vampires,

11
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:15,235
in 1905,

12
00:01:16,715 --> 00:01:19,875
the scientist though
he had the solution.

13
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:28,555
The eyes of all vampires world
were set on the brilliant vampire.

14
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:33,580
His father in person
experimented with the formula,

15
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,140
during a dawn in Baviera.

16
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,780
Ridiculed and humiliated, the young
Bernerd Amadeus took his notes

17
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,805
and his nephew Joseph Emanuel
and left to Las Antillas.

18
00:02:01,765 --> 00:02:05,805
His formula called for huge
amounts of rum and piña colada.

19
00:02:07,925 --> 00:02:13,125
In 1921 he experimented with his
nephew a new variation of the formula.

20
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:18,285
That is how Joseph Emanuel
grew up under the tropical sun,

21
00:02:19,045 --> 00:02:24,390
moving away irremediably from his uncle,
and ignorant of the vampires’ codes.

22
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:36,190
In 1933, when Professor Von Dracula, was
finally sure he had hit the nail on the head,

23
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,870
the Capa Nostra was threatening
the economy of the European Group,

24
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,615
and Cuba was suffering under
the tirany of General Machado.

25
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:53,375
Like everybody else, also Joseph
was fighting secretly and ferociously

26
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:55,175
against that son of a bitch,

27
00:02:56,535 --> 00:02:58,655
and not knowing that
he himself was a vampire,

28
00:02:59,535 --> 00:03:01,775
was involved in another war,

29
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:04,895
a deft and cruel war,

30
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,415
a vampire’s war.

31
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:42,145
He wanted my blood, the
vampire. Oh, my darling.

32
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:44,745
I’ll smash you!

33
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:48,825
Slut!

34
00:03:50,905 --> 00:03:52,425
I hate you! I hate you!

35
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,610
Hey, compadre, you always
with the macabre style.

36
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,940
This is
Radio Vampire International.

37
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:19,765
They arrived!

38
00:05:23,445 --> 00:05:25,605
Wolfgang, get the blender ready!

39
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:33,005
Well, boys,
don’t let him see it...

40
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:40,205
Well, Joseph, or how
they call you here, Pepito.

41
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,590
Hi, uncle.
Couldn’t wait to see you!

42
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,390
You said you were coming early,
but I had to send Bruno for you.

43
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,270
Ah, I had some business, uncle.

44
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,830
Wow, I see there
are new spider webs.

45
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,550
Drink, nephew,
your monthly vitamins.

46
00:06:06,175 --> 00:06:09,895
Chico, I’ ve drinking that thing
since I was 10 years old. Every month.

47
00:06:10,655 --> 00:06:14,335
I’m not a child anymore to be
taking vitamins. I’m not gonna dr...

48
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,055
Well, uncle, thanks for
everything and stuff.

49
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:27,615
Going to the street again?
This country is messed up, Joseph.

50
00:06:28,135 --> 00:06:31,560
The police is repressing
people without asking much.

51
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,440
It’s dangerous.

52
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,920
I know, uncle.

53
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,680
Stay!

54
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,120
Uncle, but there’s
something weird in this house.

55
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,080
It makes me shiver.

56
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,680
Look at all this.
It's scaring.

57
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,080
You spend months
locked in your lab,

58
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,880
you need to go out to get
some sunlight, have some fun,

59
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,720
go to the beach and enjoy
this nice sun we have here.

60
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,360
This ambiance,
the nostalgia...

61
00:06:55,316 --> 00:07:00,585
Nostalgia about your big
castle in Europe, stormy nights.

62
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:08,185
The thick fog at night,
the gusts of frozen wind...,

63
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:17,585
those are things
you have forgotten.

64
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:29,330
Soon you’ll know who you are,
Pepito: Joseph Amadeus Von Dracula.

65
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,850
The living proof
of my experiment.

66
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:40,530
Able to walk both in the cold
nights and under the ardent sun.

67
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:54,035
My message must have
reached Düsseldorf.

68
00:07:55,015 --> 00:08:00,095
The objective of this meeting is
to take a very important decision.

69
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:10,960
Here by my side, Mr. Going Down, representing Mr.
Johnny Terrori, the Vampires Beaches Inc. Chicago.

70
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,640
And why a meeting of
the Group at 9:00 AM?

71
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,960
An absurd time.

72
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,400
Mr. Terrori wants to buy
the old Von Dracula’s castle

73
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,000
and build what
would be Düsseldorf Beach,

74
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,985
the first beach for
vampires here in Europe.

75
00:08:37,745 --> 00:08:40,665
He’d pay 1000 dollars.

76
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:45,945
Fuck, this guy must
be joking. 1000 dollars.

77
00:08:46,785 --> 00:08:48,185
That's absurd.

78
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:52,105
This is an armed assault

79
00:08:52,305 --> 00:08:54,425
Nothing stops the
progress, gentlemen.

80
00:08:55,425 --> 00:09:03,490
Our beaches have allowed to thousands of vampires in
America and soon in Europe the enjoyment of life.

81
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,810
Yes, cute, but one you
have installed the beach,

82
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,890
you’ll have the control
of everything here,

83
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:13,570
and like in America,
Mr. Johnny Terrori will rule.

84
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:22,010
Sooner or later, the great Terrori
will control all the vampires in the world.

85
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,195
Either you sell,
or we will stake you!

86
00:09:26,395 --> 00:09:29,355
As representative of the
Spanish vampires, I pass...

87
00:09:29,675 --> 00:09:39,435
Gentlemen! As you can see, Vampires
Beaches has staked us in the chest.

88
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:42,595
Not precisely in the chest.

89
00:09:47,355 --> 00:09:48,755
This is our answer.

90
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:09,060
The explanation of why I was not affected
by the sun is here in this bottle.

91
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,380
It’s wonderful.

92
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:18,645
Yes, gentlemen, after so many
years the old imbecile did it.

93
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,805
I’ll go out in the morning
wearing sport clothes.

94
00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:30,805
Without having to remain the whole
day stiff in the god damned coffin.

95
00:10:31,085 --> 00:10:35,765
It is the wish of Von Dracula
to freely distribute the formula.

96
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:41,670
For free, for free...
Old cretin!

97
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,150
We’ll be the exclusive
producers of Vampisol.

98
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:53,070
We’ll make profits out of our
collegues from all over the world,

99
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,750
and not that Terrori beast.

100
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,270
And where is the formula.

101
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,870
Very far from here.

102
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,335
It is dangerous to reveal it
now that Terrori is on the lookout.

103
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:12,455
We’ll go in person to pick the boxes up.
They’re ready for the trip.

104
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,495
Havana, Cuba.

105
00:11:18,255 --> 00:11:22,975
Gentlemen, O positive
for the occasion.

106
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,740
Where is the boss?

107
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,740
Trying to get more
money from Capone.

108
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,220
Legitimate sand, Al.

109
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:38,405
The water is pumped from the
sea with fish and everything.

110
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:43,165
It’ll be the biggest beach, Al.
Düsseldorf Beach!

111
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:48,645
Bigger than New York Beach,
San Francisco Beach, or Chicago Beach.

112
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:52,205
I only need more money, Al.

113
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:04,110
What do you say, Al?
You could earn 300% in one year.

114
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,470
Only a few more months.

115
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,630
I’ve been waiting for a few more
months for a long time, Johnny.

116
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,390
I don’t see any progress
with your European vampires.

117
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:27,575
Oh, Al, the European must be signing
right now. They have no choice.

118
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,055
What do you say, Al?

119
00:14:32,895 --> 00:14:37,455
Ok, Johnny.
I’ll give you more money.

120
00:14:38,415 --> 00:14:39,095
Thank you, Al.

121
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:44,295
You’ll give me the
triple back in two months.

122
00:14:44,975 --> 00:14:47,495
Don’t disappoint me, Johnny.

123
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:49,015
It’s a great business, Al.

124
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:55,600
Good luck, Johnny. I wouldn’t
like to make you the process.

125
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,680
What’s the matter
with you, Smiley?

126
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,640
Didn’t you see I was in
the middle of a big business?

127
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,200
I wanted you to hold the meeting
with Capone for a moment, boss.

128
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,120
It’s about
Going Down from Germany.

129
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,465
The European gave him sun.
They didn’t sign.

130
00:15:16,185 --> 00:15:19,465
What? Nobody ever dared
to do that before!

131
00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:23,585
Seems to be they have in their
hands an anti-sun beverage.

132
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:27,065
The formula of the so-called
Count Dracula is in Bla bla bla...

133
00:15:28,865 --> 00:15:29,745
Where?

134
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:33,985
In Bra..., boss.
In this moment..

135
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:39,810
Count Dracula, that old
cretin found the formula.

136
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,090
Do you realize, Smiley?
We’re sunk until our necks.

137
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:50,210
People will swallow that damned
anti-solar and will go to real beaches.

138
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:57,770
Miami, Acapulco, Varadero, La Habana.
That is, Smiley, La Habana.

139
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,130
The old Von Dracula
is in Habana.

140
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,690
Or Copacabana, boss?

141
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:09,115
No, he said Bra ba ba,
and not Bla ba ba balala

142
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:13,515
You always understood that slimy
piece of shit better than me, boss.

143
00:16:13,795 --> 00:16:17,515
The formula has to be destroyed.
Play it again, Sam.

144
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:24,155
We have to do it, Smiley.
We have to stake him,

145
00:16:24,515 --> 00:16:28,795
stab him with a knife or shoot
a silver bullet in his breast.

146
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,260
Have the shipments from
Düsseldorf to Havana checked.

147
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,140
Yes, sure, boss.

148
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,020
Nurse!

149
00:18:02,735 --> 00:18:08,775
Very nice, very nice. But you’ll never
be able to play that song again,

150
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,120
How about that?
It’s forbidden,

151
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,760
for it goes against the principles
of this country’s democracy,

152
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,240
and because I don’t like it: I, representative
of the Constitutional Government of Machado.

153
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,240
So what?

154
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,360
Don’t I know you from
somewhere, blond boy?

155
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,160
If I hear that song again,
you’ll see... Did you hear?

156
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,305
Well, keep on enjoying,
gentlemen. Come on, play.

157
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,265
A revolutionary
escaped around here.

158
00:18:42,065 --> 00:18:46,545
You better stay out of trouble,
did you hear? Cuckold!

159
00:18:48,505 --> 00:18:51,425
We’re out of here.

160
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,570
Tomorrow we’ll try
Operation Trompeta again.

161
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,690
As you know we
failed last night.

162
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,210
Last night? That was all that
noise at the Captain’s house?

163
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:11,850
Exactly.

164
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,570
But it was because of
some man dating his wife.

165
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,570
Pepe.

166
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,810
So, Operation Trompeta means
hooking on that slut.

167
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:22,170
Lola, your mission as a maid at the Captain’s house
will be to inform us when the assassin is sleeping.

168
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,715
We know there are special locks in
every window and you can’t open them.

169
00:19:26,155 --> 00:19:29,275
Yes, yes, yes. The lady will open
the door to Pepe and then we get in.

170
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,075
And settle accounts
with that mother fucker.

171
00:19:32,315 --> 00:19:34,435
No, brother, we go for the safe.

172
00:19:35,035 --> 00:19:36,515
It is a Brenton and Son.

173
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,835
Brentons are my specialty.

174
00:19:39,435 --> 00:19:44,075
Lola, you know Pepe doesn’t like her.
He’s doing it for the Revolution.

175
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:46,195
Is she hot, Tiger?

176
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:49,900
Oh, boy.

177
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,420
Guys, at 22:00 sharp.

178
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,900
At twenty what...?

179
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:56,620
At ten, guys.

180
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:03,260
Loly, my cherub, Lolita, my love.
You know I only love you, girl.

181
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,220
Mission, sure. Touching all over
that old slut. Secret mission.

182
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,860
Lolita, my love, are you going
to fight with me before the wedding?

183
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,060
I’ll marry you, Lola.

184
00:20:14,373 --> 00:20:15,645
Oh, Pepe, don’t trick me.

185
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,245
My negra, we’ll get married.

186
00:20:18,005 --> 00:20:21,445
Oh, Pepe, you make me suffer.
I get jealous.

187
00:20:22,005 --> 00:20:25,005
Girl, I’m not gonna touch her.
I’ll just give her some entertainment.

188
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:27,285
Swear you’re not
gonna touch her!

189
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,525
I swear it our love.

190
00:20:28,605 --> 00:20:29,565
And your mother.

191
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:31,845
Better the 14 children
we’re gonna have, Lola.

192
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:33,685
Oh, Pepe.

193
00:20:36,085 --> 00:20:37,645
Let her go, sucker!

194
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:39,398
Your grandma! Cot stopper!

195
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:01,405
Hey, the one with the horn!

196
00:22:01,645 --> 00:22:03,365
Don’t you have to
work in the morning?

197
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:04,885
Come on, Paco, let it be.

198
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,125
No, I can’t. Every day
with the god damned horn.

199
00:22:07,565 --> 00:22:10,085
It’s 5:30!

200
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,910
Here we are, boss. What a trip!

201
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,615
What about the equipment, Smiley?

202
00:22:43,855 --> 00:22:51,855
Everything’s ok, boss. All the artillery is there:
stake thrower guns, Sharpie’s pistols and riffles.

203
00:22:52,015 --> 00:22:56,135
Ok, now watch over the
over coming from Dust.

204
00:22:56,535 --> 00:22:58,255
From Dusseldorf.

205
00:23:03,495 --> 00:23:04,615
Bring them right away.

206
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,320
What? What are you saying?
Hey, you!

207
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,520
Take, take, now!

208
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,520
Tonight.

209
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,400
Well, as soon as possible.
We have many orders.

210
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
It’s important.

211
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:36,625
Don’t worry. We’ll give you priority.
Cuban Thunder means fastness and experience.

212
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:45,225
Wow, talking by phone. Who would have told
you that...? There are no phones in Spain.

213
00:23:46,985 --> 00:23:48,665
Go to hell, man.

214
00:23:55,985 --> 00:23:59,970
This is, at last, the great night.
The Group has arrived.

215
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:05,930
Joseph will know he’s one of us.
A vampire of pure blood.

216
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,930
Joseph, are you
going out tonight?

217
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,010
Well...

218
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,930
I need you here tonight.

219
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,610
Uncle, I can’t...

220
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,490
Promise me you’re
coming back tonight.

221
00:24:23,396 --> 00:24:25,235
Ok, ok, I promise.

222
00:24:25,675 --> 00:24:27,435
I’ll send Bruno for you.

223
00:24:28,115 --> 00:24:30,315
No, no, I swear I’ll be back.

224
00:24:34,395 --> 00:24:36,195
It is I don’t-what-cero
cero and stuff.

225
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,315
There’s Pepito.

226
00:24:39,315 --> 00:24:41,635
Paraguero, mother fucker!

227
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,980
I’m sure they are conspiring
in that Café, my Captain.

228
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,700
Well, keep your eyes open,
the situation is quite screwed.

229
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,060
Yes, my Captain.

230
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,020
The gentleman's room is ready.

231
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,540
She is a hot chick,
isn’t she, my Captain?

232
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,020
Ok, out. I’m going to bed.

233
00:25:23,445 --> 00:25:29,605
My love wants tenderness tonight.
You are not angry, sugar, are you?

234
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,430
Ok, Tiger, this is yours.

235
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:54,070
Don’t be such a beast, you beast. See, it
reads “use no oocs”, it is don’t use hooks

236
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,430
Damn it, and you
almost ruined the box.

237
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:03,935
And this box here, it says “dis side up”
and you put it the other way, animal.

238
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:09,295
Wow, Galician, you’ve even
learned other languages here.

239
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:10,815
Screw you!

240
00:26:10,975 --> 00:26:14,135
Boss, let’s play another
match before getting in.

241
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,340
No way, this is a
Brenton, my bro.

242
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,380
Really, wasn’t it your specialty?

243
00:28:44,245 --> 00:28:45,725
Wow, my pipirriqui.

244
00:28:46,885 --> 00:28:48,885
So, my pipirriqui, no?

245
00:28:49,965 --> 00:28:50,765
Who’s there?

246
00:28:53,245 --> 00:28:54,485
The papers, tigre.

247
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,150
Bitch, I’m gonna get you!

248
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:14,190
Come on!

249
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:26,215
I hit him. I killed him, Tiger.
I killed him. Did you see that?.

250
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:27,495
Get on, you!

251
00:29:28,695 --> 00:29:32,975
Bad woman. I hate you,
I hate you and I hate you!

252
00:29:34,415 --> 00:29:35,695
We’ll talk later, mijita.

253
00:29:36,615 --> 00:29:37,375
Tell me, cabo.

254
00:29:37,615 --> 00:29:41,975
We found this thing in the backyard.
It’s a trumpet’s damper, my Captain.

255
00:29:43,295 --> 00:29:46,735
Perez Bar... Trumpet!

256
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,800
Lolita.

257
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,600
For me, you’re dead!
Pipirriqui.

258
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,680
Pepe, are you crazy.
You have to hide.

259
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,480
You go on.
We’ll meet tomorrow.

260
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,913
In the hiding place number 1.

261
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,065
Yes, yes, go.

262
00:30:27,905 --> 00:30:30,545
You came, nephew.
What the hell are you doing?

263
00:30:31,185 --> 00:30:33,745
I have to get lost, uncle.
Some kind of trouble.

264
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:39,290
You can’t go now, Joseph.
The Group is coming.

265
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:40,530
Who?

266
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:44,970
The Group. You’ve grown up now.

267
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,330
The police could also come and
if they caught me I’m dead.

268
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,130
Joseph, you are
not going anywhere!

269
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,690
Do you want them to shoot me?

270
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:58,810
Bullets don’t kill vampires,
not if they are not silver ones.

271
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:04,635
Come here, are you ok, uncle?
What vampires are you talking about?

272
00:31:06,075 --> 00:31:10,955
I am a vampire, Joseph.
So are you.

273
00:31:15,435 --> 00:31:17,675
You don’t believe me?

274
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,035
I think you should rest, uncle.

275
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,340
Damn, uncle!

276
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:45,300
Come, nephew. This is your coat, Joseph.
Your grandpa’s coat, the great Dracula.

277
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:53,485
Joseph doesn’t know him.

278
00:31:55,285 --> 00:32:00,365
No, no, no. I’m dreaming.
I can’t be a vampire.

279
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,565
I walk on sunshine,
see my image in the mirrors,

280
00:32:05,045 --> 00:32:07,365
and don’t suck... blood.

281
00:32:07,645 --> 00:32:12,365
You at the age of 5,
when we got here.

282
00:32:13,005 --> 00:32:19,510
You are a new type of vampire.
Thank to my formula.

283
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,430
That beverage.

284
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:38,550
Concentrate a bit. Feel it, Joseph.
It is inside of you. Let it out.

285
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,310
Let it out!

286
00:33:01,695 --> 00:33:03,295
Like your grandfather.

287
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:18,720
Women? Don’t worry. There are going to
be many more. They can’t resist it.

288
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,165
Your grandfather still
has the record.

289
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,680
Even without fangs,
he sucked them the same.

290
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:35,825
It’s O positive, mature
from 1903, the best.

291
00:33:42,665 --> 00:33:43,905
They’re out, boss.

292
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:55,465
This damper belongs here, buddy.

293
00:33:56,545 --> 00:33:58,650
What’s the name of the blond
guy that plays the trumpet?

294
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,250
I don’t know, Captain.

295
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,330
Cuckold!

296
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,250
Let’s have a coffee
or something. Ok?

297
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:25,835
I know him, Captain.
He lives by the beach.

298
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:30,075
Let’s look for that house by
the beach. Set this on fire!

299
00:34:30,395 --> 00:34:32,075
Come on, move!

300
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:37,195
Galician, you’re
civilizing here in Cuba.

301
00:34:37,915 --> 00:34:39,395
Screw you all!

302
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:48,500
Without us, the Spaniards, you’d be wearing
feathers in your heads and in your butts

303
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,820
and you’d be called Anacaona,
Taínos, Guanacabeyes.

304
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,460
Screw you!

305
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,900
Don’t let him escape. Freeze!

306
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,540
Ah, come on, Lola, girl.

307
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,140
No, I’m not gonna forgive him.

308
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,780
I sell green dwarfs.

309
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,740
Big trouble, guys,
we need to save Pepe.

310
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:21,445
Fast delivery. It’s 20 pesos.

311
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:24,085
This way!

312
00:35:24,845 --> 00:35:26,765
I think is an abandoned house.

313
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,110
Look at that style.

314
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,790
Silence, I need to concentrate.

315
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:59,590
God damn it!
It’s been a torture.

316
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,229
Fuck! What a people!

317
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:07,375
Boxes Nosferatus top quality.
Turned into dust.

318
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:15,015
Radio.

319
00:36:15,295 --> 00:36:19,495
Oh, we want to broadcast the
news to the entire world.

320
00:36:20,415 --> 00:36:21,815
Excellent idea.

321
00:36:22,175 --> 00:36:25,375
I’ll be talking in Radio
Vampire International.

322
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,109
Joseph, this is test for the
effectiveness of the formula.

323
00:36:54,265 --> 00:37:03,545
We’ve thought of a name:
Vampisol.

324
00:37:04,465 --> 00:37:05,745
I like it.

325
00:37:07,985 --> 00:37:13,585
I am ready to read the formula, free
for all the colleges of the world.

326
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,625
Cretin, stupid.

327
00:37:16,385 --> 00:37:17,975
Stop it, Professor.

328
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:27,690
Give us the formula. Free. We’ll
make an empire selling Vampisol.

329
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:34,490
Cheater! I won’t do that.
I choose the end.

330
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,610
Well done, Bruno.

331
00:38:03,635 --> 00:38:06,555
The one who moves will get
a silver bullet in his head.

332
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:17,500
Doctor.

333
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,420
Brilliant. Simply brilliant.

334
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,100
Is that the formula
we’re looking for?

335
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,700
No doubt.

336
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:35,125
It’s incredible the usage of citric acids
But there’s something inconvenient.

337
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:38,965
Thanks, doctor. Very kind.

338
00:38:39,445 --> 00:38:45,045
This is what happens when smart boys
go against the great Johnny Terrori.

339
00:38:49,365 --> 00:38:55,005
Surrender, revolutionaries,
surrender, you bunch of cuckolds.

340
00:38:55,245 --> 00:38:56,205
Joseph!

341
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,350
Kill him! Kill him!

342
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,110
Joseph, this way!

343
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,149
Shoot him!

344
00:39:39,475 --> 00:39:42,795
You can’t get anybody. Cuckolds!
Burn this. Come on!

345
00:39:46,195 --> 00:39:48,982
Where are you coming from, Tiger?
From a graduation party?

346
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,860
Terrori, here we found
some samples of the formula.

347
00:39:53,980 --> 00:40:00,540
We’ll give you some bottles if you let us go.
That’s the only way to save us all.

348
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:09,460
Ok, but you’ll go straight to Düsseldorf.
If I happen to find you again, I’ll kill you!

349
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,580
Deal.

350
00:40:14,565 --> 00:40:17,445
This
is Radio Vampire International.

351
00:40:18,645 --> 00:40:22,245
The two great financial vampire
groups haven’t reached to an agreement

352
00:40:22,525 --> 00:40:24,645
regarding the manufacturing
of Vampisol.

353
00:40:25,085 --> 00:40:29,565
The situation turned pretty violent in the
meeting that took place today here in Havana.

354
00:40:30,365 --> 00:40:32,925
We’ll keep on giving further
information in the next hours.

355
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:44,910
What’s that, Tiger?

356
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:49,350
Nothing, just a song.

357
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,350
You have to leave the country,
or they’ll kill you.

358
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,910
Let’s find a yacht to
leave the country.

359
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,230
They’re gonna kill you, Tiger.

360
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:01,430
I’m not going anywhere. There’s
something I have to do first.

361
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:07,655
When you see Lola tell
her I loved her a lot.

362
00:41:08,415 --> 00:41:12,415
Tell her yourself. She’s in
the hiding place number 1.

363
00:41:12,695 --> 00:41:16,135
We’ll be in the hiding placer number 2,
just in case you make your mind.

364
00:41:16,535 --> 00:41:19,335
Listen, they’re gonna
kill you, Tiger.

365
00:41:21,135 --> 00:41:23,055
Bullets don’t kill vampires.

366
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:35,160
Oh, boy, this is nice. Isn’t it, boss? I mean,
it would make any harm to have some Vampisol.

367
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:43,080
Vampisol is the end. Do you get it?
Somebody else enjoying Vampisol?

368
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,880
Fuck, those Americans spend
their money in development.

369
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:55,545
But we have Bruno. Bruno knows the places that
Joseph frequents. Cheer up! Tonight he’ll be ours.

370
00:41:56,625 --> 00:42:00,905
The truth is tourist here are always getting
burned in the fool’s sidewalk.

371
00:42:01,705 --> 00:42:03,825
And which is the
fool’s sidewalk?

372
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:06,945
The one with the shadow, bro.

373
00:42:09,425 --> 00:42:11,705
Bro, no doubts you must
be Angulo’s cousin.

374
00:42:12,465 --> 00:42:13,465
Which Angulo?

375
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:32,130
The guy is in the Café.
Be careful my brother.

376
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,450
Lola, calm down. Make an effort.

377
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:41,930
He’ll surely call you.

378
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:44,036
We’ll go to find out about
the yacht and come back.

379
00:42:44,555 --> 00:42:49,075
Tell him I love him!
Tell him not to leave me alone.

380
00:42:49,675 --> 00:42:52,595
This seems a radio novel, people.

381
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:16,700
Stop it, dog, stop it. This
damned dog, always trying.

382
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:21,580
Reymundo, do you happen to
have a cigarette, Reymundo.

383
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:37,845
Nobody there, boss, but he’ll come back.
He didn’t pack anything yet.

384
00:43:38,725 --> 00:43:41,965
Sharpie, hunt it from the roof.

385
00:43:44,005 --> 00:43:45,845
Take some formula in case you
have to wait until dawn.

386
00:43:46,205 --> 00:43:47,925
Ok, boys? You go there!

387
00:43:50,005 --> 00:43:53,165
Look, we need those papers.

388
00:43:53,645 --> 00:43:57,763
I’m here to make sure that nobody suspects we’re
in trouble. Keep on looking, bunch of cuckolds.

389
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:16,510
Your time to die
has arrived, tyrant!

390
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:18,750
Stop that guy!

391
00:44:31,255 --> 00:44:33,935
Down with the dictatorship!
Cuckold!

392
00:44:37,415 --> 00:44:38,535
Damn! Ouch!

393
00:45:28,145 --> 00:45:29,505
I sell green dwarfs.

394
00:45:33,065 --> 00:45:37,505
Reymundo, do you happen
to have a cigarette, buddy?

395
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:46,330
Bunchy, don’t waste water, boy!

396
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:55,010
Give me the formula, boy,
we’ll make you rich.

397
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:59,170
Good! Search him, Bruno!

398
00:46:23,475 --> 00:46:26,195
Reymundo, will you give me...

399
00:46:27,554 --> 00:46:32,900
Bunchy, boy,
if you finish the water...

400
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,660
There he is, boss.

401
00:46:59,165 --> 00:47:00,765
Ouch, they shot me.

402
00:47:01,165 --> 00:47:02,965
It’s only a scratch, silly.

403
00:47:03,405 --> 00:47:04,805
It hurts, Lola.

404
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,990
His mother!

405
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:36,550
A Vampire?

406
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:38,830
Yes, Lola, I am a vampire.

407
00:47:46,055 --> 00:47:49,095
Ill considered, spoiled boy!

408
00:47:55,695 --> 00:47:57,455
I don’t mind. I love you.

409
00:48:04,575 --> 00:48:08,406
Bunchy, you finished the water!
Damned you!

410
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,480
Abusador! Murderer!

411
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,680
Pepe, there’s a meeting.
Let’s go.

412
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,280
There he goes!

413
00:48:36,185 --> 00:48:37,345
Give it more gas, niger.

414
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:47,425
Get lost!

415
00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:05,850
Search everwhere! Everything! You’re in my list.
You'll be better of if they appear!

416
00:49:27,795 --> 00:49:32,835
Oh, Pepe, just like you and me.

417
00:49:40,035 --> 00:49:41,555
So romantic!

418
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:53,780
That’s the Captain’s fink.

419
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,380
Wow, what a movie!

420
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,780
Easy, Bruno, I’ll talk to him.

421
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:14,885
Police.
Where’s the phone?

422
00:50:20,165 --> 00:50:25,645
Reymundo, do you happen to have a cigarette,
buddy? Only one, buddy.Don’t get upset.

423
00:50:36,765 --> 00:50:39,870
Hey, 5th Station, get
me the Captain, fast!

424
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:43,510
Listen to me, boy.

425
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,110
I’m not gonna give
it to anybody.

426
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:46,350
Spit it out!

427
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:50,510
Captain, the so-called Pepe and
your maid Lola are here...

428
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:04,775
Boy, don’t even try... Give
it to me! Will make you rich.

429
00:51:05,015 --> 00:51:05,815
I rather destroy it!

430
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,800
Wow, this movie seems exciting!

431
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:58,205
It’s over. Let that go, stupid beast.
Prepare the boxes for Düsseldorf.

432
00:52:00,085 --> 00:52:03,525
I am afraid...

433
00:52:03,885 --> 00:52:05,610
We sell Düsseldorf.

434
00:52:05,645 --> 00:52:07,405
And Milano, Madrid, whatever.

435
00:52:09,765 --> 00:52:12,605
Not Cubans, please.
They taste like sugar.

436
00:52:15,085 --> 00:52:17,725
Many are negroes.

437
00:52:18,243 --> 00:52:19,036
Tourists.

438
00:52:19,433 --> 00:52:22,070
Sure, and they’re always aderezados
(decorated, tasting like whiskey).

439
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:24,110
The hiding place
No. 3 is nearby, Lolita.

440
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:27,990
Smarty, we need
to call Al Capone.

441
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:32,390
We still have time, boss.
There he is, boss.

442
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:41,670
This is not looking
good, gentlemen.

443
00:52:59,615 --> 00:53:02,415
Oh, Pepe, what if
somebody believes...

444
00:53:06,055 --> 00:53:08,530
Give me a room,
fast, come on!

445
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,800
Upstairs...

446
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,230
Indignant! Selfish!

447
00:53:35,265 --> 00:53:38,585
So, what did you expect? It’s not enough.
Not enough means it’s not enough.

448
00:53:43,385 --> 00:53:44,905
Buffalo Bill.

449
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:53,745
No way, it doesn’t move.
Help me, Lola.

450
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:07,090
My friend and I need a room.

451
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:12,050
Get out of here,
creep, scoundrels.

452
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:17,810
This is for normal couples,
not for perverts. Shame on you!

453
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:19,210
They’re here.

454
00:54:35,715 --> 00:54:38,395
Did you see my biceps?
Now, look at the triceps.

455
00:54:39,755 --> 00:54:41,195
We’re saved, Lola.

456
00:54:41,835 --> 00:54:44,035
Look, that's hiding
place No. 3 over there.

457
00:55:20,245 --> 00:55:26,925
Listen! I got you. There’s no escape!
Get down, motherfucker, or I kill you both!

458
00:55:31,205 --> 00:55:33,565
I beg you, darling.

459
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:53,070
I sell green dwarfs.

460
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:02,870
Something really big
is happening, Lola.

461
00:56:03,227 --> 00:56:04,815
I sell green dwarfs.

462
00:56:06,975 --> 00:56:08,615
2 for 5 cents, Reymundo.

463
00:56:10,255 --> 00:56:14,775
I though vampires
bite in the neck.

464
00:56:15,175 --> 00:56:17,455
Only in movies, my dear.

465
00:56:19,255 --> 00:56:22,175
I’ll see if they’re in the Café. This is
the phone number, just in case, Lolita.

466
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,080
Have you seen my people?

467
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,560
The left very early.

468
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,385
Hey, look, the English man.

469
00:56:55,785 --> 00:56:57,345
He’s got the mulata.

470
00:56:58,705 --> 00:57:05,265
Pig, bastard, you leave for this slut!
So, I’m the only one!

471
00:57:47,435 --> 00:57:49,755
What’s wrong?

472
00:57:50,035 --> 00:57:56,075
Listen carefully, Joseph, we’ll meet you
at your uncle’s house. With the formula.

473
00:57:59,195 --> 00:58:00,355
Get off, tyrant!

474
00:58:00,635 --> 00:58:07,874
Yes, don’t shut. Up with the Revolution.
Down with the tyrant!

475
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:15,620
The Europeans have them.

476
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:28,820
Murderer!

477
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,020
What? It’s only a dog.

478
00:58:33,137 --> 00:58:34,885
A dog with shoes?

479
00:58:38,285 --> 00:58:39,085
To his uncle’s.

480
00:58:44,685 --> 00:58:47,005
We took the wrong way, Smarty.

481
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:49,965
No, boss, I know the way.

482
00:59:29,095 --> 00:59:32,255
This is
Radio Vampire International.

483
00:59:33,735 --> 00:59:39,535
Europe! Europe! O positive!

484
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,440
You SOB!

485
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:05,320
We’ll interrupt this program to inform you that in
a while we’ll be transmitting news of ultima hora.

486
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:15,985
Ok, Joseph, give us the paper.
We’re in a hurry.

487
01:00:16,945 --> 01:00:18,305
Let Lola go!

488
01:00:20,225 --> 01:00:26,265
Let her go! Get her out,
Bruno. Set her free.

489
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:43,650
Go on, blond boy, burn it out!
Burn the god dammed thing!

490
01:00:56,610 --> 01:01:03,444
The situation has turned tense again. In this moment issues
about the manufacturing of vampisol are being discussed.

491
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:43,300
Abusador, this man’s been
shot by the police already.

492
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:47,580
Maybe we could
get to an agreement.

493
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,980
Do I let him have it, boss?

494
01:01:57,325 --> 01:01:59,565
Ok, blond boy,
have your last drink!

495
01:02:08,325 --> 01:02:09,845
Throwing up O positive?

496
01:02:11,085 --> 01:02:12,285
Of course,
it must taste like hell.

497
01:02:12,765 --> 01:02:15,685
You said police shot him.

498
01:02:16,085 --> 01:02:17,005
The tyrant’s police.

499
01:02:17,325 --> 01:02:18,684
With lead plomo bullets?

500
01:02:19,916 --> 01:02:20,552
Of course.

501
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:22,870
Very good joke.

502
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:29,790
Here’s your formula.
This guy is not a vampire.

503
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:34,510
I’ve lost my best men
for this thing. Human!

504
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:38,310
You, sissy!, abuser!

505
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,749
Boss, I don’t get it.

506
01:02:43,987 --> 01:02:51,295
The blond boy has drunk so much formula,
that he hates sucking people.

507
01:02:51,815 --> 01:02:55,095
He hates blood! You don’t
deserve a stake or a silver bullet.

508
01:02:55,375 --> 01:02:59,495
Human! Police will take care of you!
Call the police, Smiley.

509
01:03:00,255 --> 01:03:06,615
How are you gonna announce it? I’m not
a vampire anymore. I drank vampisol.

510
01:03:08,455 --> 01:03:11,120
Police. Pepito at his uncle’s.

511
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:18,560
Kill them, Smiley;
I’ll wait in the car.

512
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:26,405
I warned you.

513
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:32,600
You left without paying.
You didn’t buy Dusseldorf.

514
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,076
Just a moment, Al.
That formula...

515
01:03:37,865 --> 01:03:40,145
Touring with my money...

516
01:03:43,385 --> 01:03:44,905
The process no, Al.

517
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:52,225
The great stake, no, Smiley?

518
01:03:52,945 --> 01:03:54,225
In the chest, Al?

519
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:01,370
We were about to finish the
business, Al. Cerrar el asunto.

520
01:04:01,405 --> 01:04:03,810
Radio Vampire
only talks about it.

521
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:10,690
This is how I see it,
Mr. Tapone.

522
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:13,450
Not drinking the formula
all the time but:

523
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:19,250
in summer my blue beach,
in winter my vampisol.

524
01:04:27,715 --> 01:04:33,275
I like it. Come, on.
We’ll talk in the ferry.

525
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:52,900
The police!

526
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:02,540
Pepe, where did they
shot you, Tiger?

527
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:08,580
Turn that shit off, buddy.

528
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:10,380
Machado is over, Pepito.

529
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,811
Play something, Pepito.

530
01:05:16,805 --> 01:05:20,365
Hey, do me a favor,
wait for me.

531
01:05:20,805 --> 01:05:22,885
It doesn’t matter.
I know it by heart.

532
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:51,830
My uncle Wolfgang Amadeus Von Dracula
made this anti solar formula for you all.

533
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:56,790
Here you have it. Free. My song
will tell you how to make it.

534
01:05:57,470 --> 01:06:05,616
In a full moon night, mix with great
precision 2 ounces of Yerba Buena

535
01:06:06,935 --> 01:06:22,095
and a chameleon egg, add 3 ¼ ounces black
sugar, a lizard’s heart and a pinch of salt.

536
01:06:24,415 --> 01:06:35,520
A tablespoon of colibri’s blood with
a lot of piña colada and a bit of aji.

537
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:47,240
Then, quickly add some shark
extract and half a liter of alcohol.

538
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:59,025
Strain everything using a tulle strainer.
And finally cool it until it turns blue.

539
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:31,530
Now, there’s happiness we
can suck day and night.

540
01:08:08,973 --> 01:08:12,940
Now, we can suck anytime,
thanks to Pepe.

541
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,700
So next time you
go to the beach...

542
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:18,940
Be carefull!

543
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:22,900
The person next to you,
might be a vampire!

544
01:08:23,305 --> 01:08:29,157
