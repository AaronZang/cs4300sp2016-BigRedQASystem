4
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,630
Two more hours to Valparaiso.

5
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:14,269
"Hurrah me bullies, heave the capstan, o,
Goodbye, farewell, goodbye, farewell.

6
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:24,911
Goodbye to the drudgery, goodbye to the ship,
Hourra, oh Mexico

7
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:30,287
Then we'll bound for Valparaiso"

8
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,926
The port lies below

9
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:37,654
It was the richest port.
It was the goal, the destination.

10
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,725
It was often lauded.

11
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,024
One scissors' snip at Panama
put it in its place...

12
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,693
...at the bottom of the bag,
on the Pacific coast.

13
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:46,470
It's still a port.

14
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,800
Valparaiso Chile, 300,000 inhabitants,
between the Cordillera and the Ocean.

15
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:55,612
It is not the richest, but it lives,
It lives well.

16
00:01:55,949 --> 00:02:01,012
A commercial city lives with it,
alongside it, below, at the base of the hills.

17
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,983
Another city exists on the hills.

18
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,783
Not a city, a federation
of villages, one per hill.

19
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,590
42 hills, 42 villages.

20
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,559
Not another city, another world.

21
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:21,131
Two worlds that communicate by ramps,
by stairs, by cable railways.

22
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:27,429
Pronounced horribly as
Valparaiso in French...

23
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,306
...it's Val Paraiso,
the Valley of Paradise.

24
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,876
Paradise as a sunlit step...

25
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,571
...after the nightmares of the crossing
for the sailors who baptized her.

26
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,917
Or the last step before Paradise.

27
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,779
In this city, everyday at noon
the sun performs its wonders.

28
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,916
All the women of Valparaiso
bring out their parasols...

29
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,916
...to walk all the penguins of Valparaiso.

30
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,592
All the bridges jut into midair.

31
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:31,701
All the homes are triangular,
impossible to furnish.

32
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,299
All the stairs end midhill.

33
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,369
One must go back up or fly away.

34
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,275
With the sun,
misery no longer seems like misery...

35
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,279
...and the cable railways seem
no longer like cable railways.

36
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:59,458
This is the lie of Valparaiso.
Her lie is the sun.

37
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,200
Her truth, the sea.

38
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,364
Created, forged, peopled by sailors.

39
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,666
Here the traces are English...

40
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,211
the Bank of London...

41
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,480
...the triumphal arches..

42
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,012
...the Sign of the Lion...

43
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:56,014
...the Salvation Army, and perhaps
an inferior quality of whisky.

44
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,757
France offered the New World
the gallantry of its corsairs...

45
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:05,192
...and that last of secret societies,
the Alliance Francaise.

46
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,333
The Spaniards baptized the city.

47
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,936
They converted her, adopted her,
and married her.

48
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,869
She fooled them with the Dutch.

49
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,406
She persists.

50
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,708
But all the maritime nations have
left her a small souvenir.

51
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:23,609
One finds exactly what
one finds in sailors homes.

52
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:27,912
The souvenir of Casablanca,
the souvenir of Singapore.

53
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,718
How many homes
are souvenirs of boats...

54
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:37,085
...until the point when, falling down,
they become boats themselves.

55
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,995
Up, down...

56
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,268
...up, up, down, up.

57
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,929
A one legged man climbs the stairs.
1 21 steps.

58
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,807
He knows it, he counts them.

59
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:27,108
One needs a strong heart,
and also a good memory.

60
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,550
One can descend by the ramp
ten times faster than by the stairs.

61
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:35,448
The descent is ten times faster
than the climb up again.

62
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,789
One descends laughing.

63
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,358
One climbs panting.

64
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,690
It's funny, it's tiring...

65
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,593
...it's abominable, joyful, inhuman...

66
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,792
...solemn, ridiculous and strange.

67
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,932
Too many people up above,
and too few down below.

68
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,142
In one hour, it will be the opposite.

69
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:01,511
Taken and retaken without end,
like the fort of Douaumont.

70
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:04,214
It's an activity from war
or maneuvers...

71
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,882
...with assaults, sorties, breaches...

72
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:10,021
...repulses, victories and defeats.

73
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,854
And sometimes, truces.

74
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,374
No one dies of hunger by the sea.
There are fish.

75
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,785
But fish do not fly.

76
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:58,246
So once again, the cable railways.

77
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,086
Very picturesque, the cable railways.

78
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:05,856
But the life of the people above
depends on them.

79
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,299
And not everything
goes up with them.

80
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,861
Water, for example,
which is lacking.

81
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,471
And yet the wash is done,
and girls wear white blouses.

82
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,843
What price the white blouses...

83
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,535
...the clean faces when
water arrives in barrels?

84
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,516
What price the most simple things,
bathing, cooking?

85
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:30,722
What price the desire to live?
And what price happiness?

86
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,286
Everything goes by the cable railways.

87
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,428
There are thirty of them.

88
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,066
They have few accidents,
but they break down.

89
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,260
Until they are repaired,
the life of the entire hill is disturbed.

90
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,804
Controllers and mechanics
watch the whole city go by...

91
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:59,136
...they know adventure
and secrets better than anyone.

92
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,074
They are the keepers
of the museum of the hills.

93
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,647
The hills are called Hill of the Baron,
of the Cross...

94
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:45,983
...of the Butterfly...

95
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:49,355
...the Nuns, the Milkmaids.

96
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:53,463
The higher one ascends the hills,
the poorer the people.

97
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,863
At the summit,
the poorest of the poor.

98
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,236
Around each hill...

99
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:02,396
...there are large houses made of
black iron and rust, the castles of the poor.

100
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,976
How do they live?
The hills are against them.

101
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,240
Children do not take the elevators,
just to save a few cents.

102
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,322
All these are necessary:
Water, gas...

103
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,253
...a school, a clinic...

104
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,191
...waterworks.

105
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,799
But first, water.

106
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:38,274
Some have created a solution
with iron and rope.

107
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:42,103
But the problem is
a common one.

108
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:47,615
The hill's 'Junta', a kind of
citizens' council, convenes:

109
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,151
We must do something.

110
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,913
"We need houses...

111
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,318
...to solve the serious problem...

112
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:57,892
...of the hygiene in our neighbourhood,
in the center of the main port of the country.

113
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:04,100
It is therefore indispensable to interest the
public, and private organizations in building.

114
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:09,668
The Governor of the province
has promised us his help."

115
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:16,480
"The Workers Committee knows...

116
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:19,917
...that the organizations and
the owners do not agree.

117
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,714
It is a new delay."

118
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,219
"We need water immediately!

119
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,393
This haggling drags on.
One cannot see the end of it!"

120
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,594
When it burns, it burns well.

121
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:15,459
The entire male population
belongs to the firefighting corps.

122
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:19,399
Wooden homes, and then the wind.

123
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,434
The wind blows hard, up there.

124
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,444
It's good for drying laundry,
but not as good for children's lungs.

125
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,777
At least the air is pure and clear.

126
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,221
This is the third element of Valparaiso:

127
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:41,223
...the air of the hills, which is
somewhat like their gaze.

128
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:45,260
Like the gaze of their people,
courteous, a bit melancholic...

129
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,228
...friend of animals
and quiet pleasures...

130
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,665
...on which we like directing the same calm,
courteous, and amicable gaze.

131
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:54,191
Around this city of seamen,
lies a people of horsemen.

132
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,736
The butcher's on the hill
is called 'Buffalo Bill'.

133
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,670
Near Valparaiso, at Vina del Mar,
a horse has won the Grand Prize.

134
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:39,071
This is its hour of glory,
and it takes advantage of it.

135
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:47,711
After five years, the horse enters
into the city's game, up, down...

136
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,649
...up, down.

137
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,754
But up above, Buffalo Bill
the butcher waits for its meat.

138
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:59,222
A black cross on a horse
is the sign of death.

139
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:03,197
And the horse's eyes widen from fear,
for it knows.

140
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,416
Men do not know.

141
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,488
They do not want to know.

142
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,383
They believe in an eternal future,
shut up in a bottle.

143
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,122
At least something will
remain of them.

144
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,760
When worry touches them,
with its cold nose...

145
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,837
...instinct brings them towards
the warmth and the light.

146
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,636
This is the fourth element
of Valparaiso: blood.

147
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,743
And this is its memory.

148
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,677
Memory of the pirates.

149
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,692
Hawkins, Drake...

150
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,321
...Joris of Spilbergen.

151
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,588
Torture and pillage.

152
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,231
Memory of Spain.

153
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,864
Torture and pillage.

154
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,231
And colonial oppression for centuries.

155
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,187
Memory of fires.

156
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:10,884
The elements take over from men.
After fire, the sea.

157
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,354
Memory of storms.

158
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:16,758
The boats of Jules Verne, moored
at the docks of the drowned of Gavarni.

159
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,102
And it goes on.

160
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,533
England supports Chile's independence.

161
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:30,214
Isabelle the Second of Spain
has bombarded the city.

162
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:33,111
The last stand of a frustrated colonizer.

163
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:35,809
And then the earth opens, in turn.

164
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:42,384
Earthquakes, floods, fires...

165
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,822
...cyclones and pillages...

166
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,488
...this was to be the destiny
of this peaceful people.

167
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,436
And it's not finished yet.

168
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,510
But what will finish?

169
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,817
The sirens haven't finished
singing in the port.

170
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:12,454
They are there, waiting.
They listen.

171
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:13,988
They wait.

172
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:20,229
Neither the alphabet of pavilions,
nor the regular movement of ships...

173
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:23,596
...correspond to what once was
Valparaiso's adventure.

174
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,693
But nostalgia for
yesterday's adventure...

175
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,806
...is a useful way to flee
the adventure of today.

176
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,569
On its hills, where the first good wind...

177
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:38,172
...will bring the great kite championship
with its duels, feints, triumphs...

178
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,950
...adventure is about conquering
liveable homes...

179
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:44,486
...gardens that can be cultivated,
and justice.

180
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,358
This is today's adventure.

181
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,653
It is another conception of adventure.

182
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:53,297
Perhaps the children of construction
workers will once play 'construction'...

183
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:56,025
...as we once played 'pirates'.
