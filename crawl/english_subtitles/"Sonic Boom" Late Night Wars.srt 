2
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,582
             Grrr!

3
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,189
       Here you go, kid.

4
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,626
     Is this your grandson?

5
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,727
             Zing!

6
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,530
     I've seen newer pictures
         on a cave wall.

7
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:34,199
           - Zang!
- Can it, you obsequious hack!

8
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,169
       This isn't even you.
  This guy is young and healthy.

9
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,472
 And he still has that sparkle
      of hope in his eyes.

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,108
             (Groans)
    I need some new headshots.

11
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,677
     Oh, yeah. Work it, CC.

12
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,679
   You've still got it, baby.

13
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,418
    Give me pouty, come on.

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,321
   Now give me tiger. Rarrh!

15
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,525
     Who's a funny monkey!

16
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:04,530
     Wow! I've never seen a
professional photo shoot before.

17
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:07,733
   Now roll over and play dead,
              baby.

18
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,370
 Pretty sure you still haven't.

19
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,408
   Hello. What have we here?

20
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,691
          He's a waif.

21
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,526
    The orphan of our times.

22
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:39,331
   A lost child, oblivious to
the never-ending sea of despair.

23
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,266
          How poetic!

24
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,536
        Hey, doll-face.
       Show's over here.

25
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:52,277
  Hey, Knucks, you're famous.

26
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:56,148
      Cool! Who's the doofus
 with the trash can on his head?

27
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,417
        Is that the guy
      from the newspaper?

28
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,586
         I don't know.

29
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:03,055
       He doesn't look like
 he has a trash can on his head.

30
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,994
         It is the guy
     that's in the picture.

31
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,064
    Hey, Trash Can Head Guy.

32
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,266
       - Sign my newspaper.
           - Mine too.

33
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,535
    My standards for celebrity
          are quite low.

34
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,073
            (TV on)

35
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,575
           Hey, Wolfie,
     get a load of this guy.

36
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,377
     If this fashion trend
          catches on,

37
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,613
        I'm gonna start
   throwing trash in my hat.

38
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,548
    (Laughter and applause)

39
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:34,186
     You, sir, are the master
   of biting social commentary.

40
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,489
  You're really embracing this
  whole Trash Can Head thing.

41
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,592
 Yup. You know what people say
 when they see me wearing this?

42
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,594
      "I weep for the future
          of our kind"?

43
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,129
   Well, yeah, some of them.

44
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:47,499
        But most people
  think it looks wicked cool.

45
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,964
              Huh?

46
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,485
              Gah!

47
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,088
      And that's our show.

48
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,123
              Thanks
   to the Comedy Chimp Players

49
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,125
     and our musical guest
         Justin Beaver.

50
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,229
    - Good night, everyone.
          - (Cheering)

51
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,599
       Mr Chimp, someone
  is trying to blackmail you.

52
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,668
  They just dropped off these
 horribly embarrassing photos.

53
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,609
         Those are my new
    publicity shots, bonehead.

54
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:07,346
  Ugh! You could carry groceries
   in those bags under my eyes.

55
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,649
Write it down, I'll use it next
 time the mayor's on the show.

56
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,385
      Those aren't wrinkles,
       they're laugh lines.

57
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,153
  Gives you character. Ha-ha!

58
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,457
How would you know? You've done
 the same shtick for 20 years.

59
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:19,658
             Zing!

60
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,060
             Guess
  I have to give in to nature.

61
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:27,332
          All natural
cosmetic facial youthification.

62
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,142
         Move it, losers.
   Evil genius coming through.

63
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,077
   Eggman, what do you want?

64
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,679
      First I want to say
        I'm a huge fan.

65
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,648
       And I have something
          to offer you.

66
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,450
   A magic boot that you rub
 and a genie grants you wishes

67
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,252
      and I just give you
         all my money?

68
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,622
If so, I'm in. Cos the last one
    you sold me didn't work.

69
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,658
   I want to be your sponsor.

70
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,328
  Just put the Eggman Industries
     logo on your trash can.

71
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,464
    No. You think my trash can
           is for sale?

72
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,066
        It is not, sir.

73
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,569
       I have integrity.
      I will not sell out.

74
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:07,239
        10 per cent off
 all your Meh Burger purchases

75
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,608
   if you slap this sticker
   on that head trash thing.

76
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,544
          Done and done!
       Give me Meh Burgers.

77
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,153
  This is it, Wolfie, the last
  show before my big surgery.

78
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,356
I was wondering... while you're
gone, who's gonna replace you?

79
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,558
         Not that anybody
     could ever replace you.

80
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:30,062
 But if you don't have anyone
 in mind, I'll throw my hat...

81
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,431
        I want you to know
 your show will be in good hands

82
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,599
     while you're getting
     your face overhauled.

83
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,602
    And don't worry, when they
  ask me to take over full time,

84
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,339
     I'll probably say no.

85
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,140
   (Laughs) You'll be great.

86
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:43,342
           Too great.

87
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,843
   The viewers will love him

88
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,713
   and I'll wind up playing the
  Yuk-Yuk Hut in Gogoba Village.

89
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,083
  I need to find a guest host
that no one will take seriously.

90
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,185
      A flash in the pan.
      A talentless hack.

91
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,255
    No, I have a worse idea.

92
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,360
           Let's try
  those monologue jokes again.

93
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,428
           Just read
   what's on the cards here.

94
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,297
         OK. Here goes.

95
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,533
  "So the mayor's in the news
again. Did you hear about this?"

96
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,036
  What's so funny about that?

97
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,571
   Read the rest of the joke.

98
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,640
         Ohh. How come?

99
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,509
   There's a Mr The Hedgehog
          to see you.

100
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,444
  Hmm... Doesn't ring a bell.

101
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,645
          Hey, Knucks.

102
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,315
      Hey. Did you hear
the mayor's in the news again?

103
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,449
          Ba-da-boom!

104
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,618
             (Wolfie)
   You didn't finish the joke.

105
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,054
       We're stoked for you
     but are you up to this?

106
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,424
    Does a bucket on your head
  qualify you to host a TV show?

107
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,160
First of all, it's not a bucket,
       it's a trash can.

108
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:38,597
Secondly, it's not a trash can,
   it's a fashion statement.

109
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,633
  Fourth, you're just jealous
that I finally found my calling

110
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,469
    as a fashion designer /
        model / TV host.

111
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,605
         I don't want you
      to embarrass yourself.

112
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:50,575
I'm disappointed in you, Sonic.
     In you and the mayor.

113
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:54,246
   Now, if you'll excuse me,
the jokes don't read themselves.

114
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,415
   This isn't gonna end well.

115
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,083
            (TV on)

116
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,353
            Welcome
   to the Comedy Chimp show.

117
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,156
      I'm your guest host,
      Trash Can Head Guy.

118
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,992
           - Say, Wolf?
    - What is it, O great one?

119
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,660
         - Knock knock.
         - Who's there?

120
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,663
           - The mayor.
    - The uh... the mayor who?

121
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,565
 The mayor's in the news again!

122
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,267
        (Cymbal crashes)

123
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,668
      (Audience muttering)

124
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,403
        This is painful.

125
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,106
  Oh, here's a good one. What
  do you call a duck with a...

126
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,309
     Wait, no... What's the
difference between a duck and...

127
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,044
 Wait, maybe it's not a duck...

128
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,245
     Can we turn this off?

129
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,281
  Let me see those cue cards.

130
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:33,084
          - Whoa! Aargh!
      - (Audience laughing)

131
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:38,623
  Zing! You, sir, are the master
     of slapstick tomfoolery.

132
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,359
         - Ugh! Aargh!
         - (Laughter)

133
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,466
           (Whistles)

134
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,342
          Wolfie, my key
      doesn't work any more.

135
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,111
     You are correct, sir.
       Locks got changed.

136
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,582
   Network's taking the show
   in a new direction, so...

137
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,550
     - What new direction?
           - More...

138
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,253
        I don't know...
    Is "trash-canny" a word?

139
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,624
         Wait up, TCHG.

140
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:22,334
 Hello, Yuk-Yuk Hut. Unless...

141
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:27,038
   Help you get rid of Knuckles
           as host, eh?

142
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,507
    And what's in it for me?

143
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:32,277
You sponsor the first ever live
  broadcast of a robot attack.

144
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,812
         I'm listening.

145
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,315
 Imagine, a brutal, horrendous
 siege with robots, missiles...

146
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,118
  and the Eggman Industries logo
       on every bit of it.

147
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,387
      Repeat that last part.
       I wasn't listening.

148
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,055
   If you sponsor the attack,

149
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,558
          you'll also be
 the show's sponsor from now on.

150
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,593
             Deal!

151
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,495
          Ugh! Aargh!

152
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,531
          I got to admit
      this is pretty funny.

153
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:58,236
 Fire missiles! Brought to you
     by Eggman Industries.

154
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,209
       Uh, what was that?

155
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,546
  This hole was made possible
     by Eggman Industries.

156
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:10,582
  Eggman's attacking the studio!
     We got to help Knuckles.

157
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,617
      Wait, I want to see
      what happens next.

158
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:16,588
   Your new movie sets a new
standard for incredible effects.

159
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,623
  Let's roll a clip, shall we?

160
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:26,665
        Amazing! It's like
      it's really happening.

161
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,102
    Need a wall shattered?
    Call Eggman Industries.

162
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,095
     This battle is sponsored
      by Eggman Industries.

163
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,463
     You have to wear this.

164
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,066
 Yeah... I don't wear the logo
      of the losing team.

165
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,968
  You don't have any Sonic hats,
             do you?

166
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,170
             - Ow!
             - Huh?

167
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,539
   Sticks, you came to my show!
              Cool!

168
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,641
      Eggman's attacking!
      We need your help.

169
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,977
 I'll be right back after this.

170
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:19,150
So the mayor's back in the news.
  (Laughs) It seems that he...

171
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,227
 Good to have you back, Knucks.

172
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,495
   Good to be back, you guys.

173
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,631
    If I ever get carried away
        by my ego again...

174
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,165
      We'll let you know.

175
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,434
         No, make sure
      I get a better show.

176
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:40,171
      Engage Mega Stomp-bot.
   New from Eggman Industries.

177
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,707
  On my mark... Three, two...

178
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,111
           (Grunting)

179
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,451
       What have I done?

180
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,020
 Oh, yeah, I got my show back.

181
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,323
             Zing!

182
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,457
           (Applause)

183
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,126
     Thank you. Thank you.

184
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,594
We'll keep things moving along,

185
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:06,031
 but first I want to thank our
new sponsor, Eggman Industries,

186
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,566
 makers of the Kiddie Fun Ball.

187
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,338
           (Ticking)

188
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,606
     Oh, this is not good.

188
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:21,719
