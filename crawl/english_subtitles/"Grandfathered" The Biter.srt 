1
00:00:03,418 --> 00:00:05,156
I wish they were available in a

2
00:00:05,181 --> 00:00:07,311
- darker shade of black, though.
- Ugh.

3
00:00:07,355 --> 00:00:09,589
- How 'bout these?
- Let's see these.

4
00:00:09,657 --> 00:00:11,391
This is how you see me?

5
00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:13,794
A guy who wears boxy glasses like an idiot?

6
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:15,295
A boxy-glassed idiot?

7
00:00:15,363 --> 00:00:16,930
- Hmm...
- Stand down.

8
00:00:16,998 --> 00:00:18,318
He left them in Edie's bed again.

9
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:20,801
Give me, give me, give
me, give me, give me.

10
00:00:20,868 --> 00:00:22,936
You're welcome.

11
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:25,939
Yeah. Oh, yeah. See?
Sophisticated yet playful.

12
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:27,874
Welcome home, boys.

13
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:31,878
- What? Let me see.
- No.

14
00:00:31,946 --> 00:00:34,114
W... You going out with Ryan again? Whoo...

15
00:00:34,182 --> 00:00:35,916
It's not Ryan. It's Brian.

16
00:00:35,983 --> 00:00:37,951
Wait, there might be a Ryan also.

17
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:39,453
Anyway, this is Scott.

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,988
He's very promising. His
sister is my accountant.

19
00:00:42,056 --> 00:00:43,990
Sounds like a write-off to me.

20
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:45,826
I literally came up with that right now.

21
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:47,060
- Literally right now?
- Uh-huh.

22
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:48,161
Wow.

23
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:49,796
Your accountant's a woman?

24
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:52,132
Um, yes. With a hot brother.

25
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,602
Oh. Oh. Well, you know what they say.

26
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,970
- Small boat...
- Stop...

27
00:00:57,038 --> 00:00:58,071
No one says that!

28
00:00:58,139 --> 00:01:00,006
- Small dinghy.
- Oh. Hello?

29
00:01:00,074 --> 00:01:02,342
See, the beauty of the small dinghy joke,

30
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,910
you didn't see it coming.

31
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:04,878
Came out of nowhere. Right.

32
00:01:04,946 --> 00:01:05,912
- Yeah.
- That was Edie's school.

33
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,314
They want me to come down there.

34
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:09,816
- I'm an emergency contact.
- You are? Am I?

35
00:01:09,884 --> 00:01:11,263
Am I an emergency contact?

36
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:13,010
I mean, I'm the most important man

37
00:01:13,054 --> 00:01:14,488
in her life. Besides her father.

38
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:16,323
I mean, he plays a certain role, too.

39
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,824
I should go with you.

40
00:01:17,892 --> 00:01:20,494
- Yes. Fine. Whatever.
- All right.

41
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:22,162
Oh, you know what? They called me, too.

42
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,710
They-they tried me three times, so...

43
00:01:23,765 --> 00:01:25,031
Ten times, actually, so...

44
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:27,033
That's great! You win! It's so weird.

45
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:29,970
I wonder why they couldn't
reach Vanessa and Gerald.

46
00:01:30,037 --> 00:01:32,773
Look at us. Right? Phones
off so we can focus on the app

47
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,775
we created to help co-parent our kid.

48
00:01:34,842 --> 00:01:37,144
- Best parents ever.
- Oh, yeah.

49
00:01:39,113 --> 00:01:42,015
Strobe light.

50
00:01:43,117 --> 00:01:45,952
We spent too much time rehearsing that.

51
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,472
Now we're hunkering
down. We're ready to rock.

52
00:01:48,497 --> 00:01:49,313
Yes.

53
00:01:49,357 --> 00:01:50,824
Uh, so here's how the app works.

54
00:01:50,892 --> 00:01:51,892
The app helps par...

55
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:52,959
Ravi?

56
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,494
Sorry, still on that handshake.

57
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:55,729
I was thinking I could improve upon it,

58
00:01:55,797 --> 00:01:56,963
but I like what you guys are doing.

59
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:58,632
I'm all ears.

60
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:00,500
The app helps parents
who don't live together

61
00:02:00,568 --> 00:02:02,903
coordinate their kids'
lives. Like schedules...

62
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,410
- Appointments.
- School assignments.

63
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:07,207
I came up with the idea, and
I also came up with the idea

64
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:08,975
for Gerald to do all the work making it.

65
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:10,310
We are a very good team.

66
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:11,845
Color me impressed.

67
00:02:11,913 --> 00:02:13,413
I have an eye for this kind of thing.

68
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:15,015
You guys have the next
Google on your hands.

69
00:02:15,082 --> 00:02:16,216
Oh! I knew it.

70
00:02:16,284 --> 00:02:18,018
Google? Yeah,

71
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:19,719
it's just a prototype
that lives on my computer.

72
00:02:19,787 --> 00:02:21,421
Time-out. Prototype? Computer?

73
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:22,689
Um, that's how Google started.

74
00:02:22,757 --> 00:02:24,424
- Keep going.
- Uh...

75
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:26,092
we would need some investor
money for stuff like

76
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,394
software and server space.

77
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:29,896
- Stickers, hoodies, water bottles.
- Yeah.

78
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:31,097
Well, you are in luck.

79
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:32,499
You ever heard of a guy named

80
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:34,201
- Kirk Kelly?
- Yeah, yeah.

81
00:02:34,268 --> 00:02:35,702
He helped launch ChurchHookups.com

82
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,704
and-and PornGarbage. You know him?

83
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:39,206
Do I know him?

84
00:02:39,273 --> 00:02:41,074
Yeah, we were in the same
pledge class together:

85
00:02:41,142 --> 00:02:43,109
Chi Psi, AKA the frat that
loved Adam Sandler movies

86
00:02:43,177 --> 00:02:45,412
and partying. Yeah, Kirk and I are bros.

87
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,660
We text on the regs.

88
00:02:46,685 --> 00:02:49,106
Do you think you could text him for us?

89
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,450
Unfortunately, I'm out of texts this month.

90
00:02:50,518 --> 00:02:53,453
But... you guys are worth the seven cents.

91
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:54,921
I'm on it.

92
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:56,256
Awesome.

93
00:02:56,324 --> 00:02:58,058
Yo, man.

94
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,059
Oh, no, no, and then it's a left.

95
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:02,229
Your rhythm's way off.

96
00:03:02,296 --> 00:03:03,296
You're better than this.

97
00:03:03,297 --> 00:03:04,297
Sorry.

98
00:03:04,298 --> 00:03:05,298
Thank you, Ravi!

99

Mmm!

101
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:13,607
Now, that is good maté.

102
00:03:13,674 --> 00:03:15,876
Thank you for coming down today, Sara.

103
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:16,977
And who are you?

104
00:03:17,044 --> 00:03:18,411
Oh, I'm Edie's other emergency contact.

105
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,213
No, he's not.

106
00:03:20,281 --> 00:03:21,748
Different truths.

107
00:03:21,816 --> 00:03:23,650
Anyway, I'm sure you're wondering

108
00:03:23,718 --> 00:03:25,483
- why you're here. Edie is fine.
- Good.

109
00:03:25,508 --> 00:03:26,410
Good, good.

110
00:03:26,454 --> 00:03:28,154
She was just bitten by another child.

111
00:03:28,222 --> 00:03:29,556
- What?!
- What? Edie.

112
00:03:29,624 --> 00:03:31,024
- Honey!
- She's permanently disfigured.

113
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:33,159
She's a monster now.

114
00:03:33,227 --> 00:03:35,328
Oh, no, it goes away when you rub it.

115
00:03:35,396 --> 00:03:36,196
What?

116
00:03:36,264 --> 00:03:38,231
What little sicko did this?

117
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:39,666
Bring him in here.

118
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:40,567
Or her.

119
00:03:40,635 --> 00:03:41,968
Oh, so it's a her.

120
00:03:42,036 --> 00:03:43,036
No, I'm just pointing out

121
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,171
the sexism in your phraseology.

122
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:46,039
Yeah, Sara, get with the times.

123
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:48,074
Even some accountants are women.

124
00:03:48,142 --> 00:03:49,075
Just tell us who did this, so we can speak

125
00:03:49,143 --> 00:03:51,111
to the parents and work it out.

126
00:03:51,178 --> 00:03:53,813
Well, obviously I can't
share the biter's identity.

127
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:56,473
- I'm sorry?
- It's a policy here at Cricket Canyon.

128
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:58,852
These incidents, they're teachable moments

129
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,488
that we prefer to handle internally.

130
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:03,790
That way the biter doesn't feel less than.

131
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:05,058
"Less than"? Someone bit Edie.

132
00:04:05,092 --> 00:04:07,661
There is less Edie.

133
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:09,329
Well, didn't break skin, so...

134
00:04:09,397 --> 00:04:11,131
This is unbelievable. In my day...

135
00:04:11,198 --> 00:04:12,933
wow, I can't believe you just made me say

136
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,601
"in my day"... school policy

137
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:16,469
did not prevent parents from

138
00:04:16,537 --> 00:04:17,857
- protecting their children...
- Okay,

139
00:04:17,872 --> 00:04:19,606
so you're starting to raise your voice

140
00:04:19,674 --> 00:04:21,041
because you're getting angry...

141
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:22,388
No, that's how she always talks.

142
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,111
Right now, you're at an orange-red.

143
00:04:25,179 --> 00:04:29,115
What do you think we can
do to get you down to green?

144
00:04:29,183 --> 00:04:32,285
- Oh...
- I'm not sure the chart's helping.

145
00:04:32,353 --> 00:04:33,620
Yee-haw!

146
00:04:33,688 --> 00:04:34,888
- Dad cow...
- I mean, some even

147
00:04:34,956 --> 00:04:37,190
say binary code is the language of love.

148
00:04:37,258 --> 00:04:38,291
Who says that?

149
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,492
Programmers.

150
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,994
Gerald!

151
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:42,562
There you are. First off, sweet pad.

152
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,998
I rock that exact same
futon. More importantly,

153
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:46,698
didn't you get my 50 texts? That's,

154
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:47,992
- like, four bucks, man.
- Oh.

155
00:04:48,035 --> 00:04:49,202
Yeah, yeah. We're staying offline

156
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,971
until we make some real progress.

157
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:52,973
Guys, I've got great news.

158
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,741
I got you that meeting with Kirk Kelly!

159
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:57,010
This Friday, 2:00.

160
00:04:57,078 --> 00:04:58,345
- Oh.
- Uh...

161
00:04:58,412 --> 00:05:00,213
Yeah... uh, Friday, that's only three days

162
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:01,514
to get the app fully functional, though.

163
00:05:01,582 --> 00:05:02,716
And prepare a pitch.

164
00:05:02,783 --> 00:05:06,486
Oy vey, as the Jews say.

165
00:05:06,554 --> 00:05:08,688
I gotta say, this isn't
the reception I expected.

166
00:05:08,756 --> 00:05:11,157
I thought I'd be getting
sprayed with champagne right now.

167
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:13,226
- I brought these goggles.
- No, it's awesome.

168
00:05:13,294 --> 00:05:14,370
Ravi, this is amazing. Thank you. Okay?

169
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:16,235
We'll be ready by Friday. Thank you.

170
00:05:16,263 --> 00:05:17,307
- Yes.
- You know? And since

171
00:05:17,332 --> 00:05:18,255
I know Kirk, you can

172
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:21,234
practice your presentation
on me this Thursday.

173
00:05:21,302 --> 00:05:23,169
Now, with that said, I'm
gonna get out of your hair,

174
00:05:23,237 --> 00:05:25,205
because you kids have a lot of work to do.

175
00:05:25,272 --> 00:05:26,439
- Thank you, Ravi!
- Hey, Ravi.

176
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:29,133
- Hey.
- What's my chef doing here?

177
00:05:29,176 --> 00:05:31,211
- Why do you have my baby?
- She got bitten at school!

178
00:05:31,278 --> 00:05:33,079
- What?
- You okay, Mama?

179
00:05:33,147 --> 00:05:34,966
They called us both down, so, you know...

180
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:35,639
And get this,

181
00:05:35,683 --> 00:05:38,118
they have some touchy-feely
policy not to tell us

182
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:41,087
which kid did it, so we are
powerless to protect Edie.

183
00:05:41,155 --> 00:05:44,148
- Uh...
- Actually, we agree with the policy.

184
00:05:44,191 --> 00:05:46,926
Yeah. It's progressive. So, you know,

185
00:05:46,994 --> 00:05:49,229
they do things differently than
when we were back at school.

186
00:05:49,296 --> 00:05:51,464
Freaking millennials.

187
00:05:51,532 --> 00:05:53,099
You should've seen her
face down at the school.

188
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,268
Total orange-red. Ow.

189
00:05:55,336 --> 00:05:56,703
The important thing is is that Edie's okay.

190
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:58,471
And let's just trust
the school to handle this

191
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:00,373
the Cricket Canyon way and-and make sure

192
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:02,242
that Edie doesn't get bitten again.

193
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:03,810
She got bitten again!

194
00:06:03,878 --> 00:06:06,379
Cricket freaking Canyon!

195
00:06:06,447 --> 00:06:08,114
Now can we handle this my way?

196
00:06:08,182 --> 00:06:11,317
Hey, hey! Enjoy a tasty app
while you work on your app.

197
00:06:11,385 --> 00:06:13,753
It's not really an app, it's
an entree, but I used "app"

198
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:16,122
for the jo... I'm still
not on the contact list?!

199
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,424
What's it gonna take?

200
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:22,262
Well, I'm mad about Edie, too.

201
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:24,100
I'm mad about two things.

202
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:31,311
So we can talk to their
parents and make it stop.

203
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:33,480
Right. So we're gonna ask you one more time

204
00:06:33,547 --> 00:06:35,382
who it is, okay? And don't say...

205
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:36,483
Santa.

206
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,385
- Santa!
- My baby ain't no rat.

207
00:06:38,452 --> 00:06:39,986
Maybe we need to change schools.

208
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:42,455
This is the worst week for this to happen.

209
00:06:42,523 --> 00:06:43,757
I guess we got to cancel the pitch, right?

210
00:06:43,824 --> 00:06:45,258
You are not canceling the pitch.

211
00:06:45,326 --> 00:06:46,626
You are not changing schools.

212
00:06:46,694 --> 00:06:48,328
You let me handle this.
I'll find the biter.

213
00:06:48,396 --> 00:06:50,597
Yeah, and I'm gonna help her.
No matter what we have to do.

214
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:54,267
Any ideas on what we should do?

215
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:57,470
Santa.

216
00:06:57,538 --> 00:06:59,472
It is so great that you volunteered

217
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,341
to be Helper Crickets today.

218
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:02,509
Of course.

219
00:07:02,576 --> 00:07:03,576
We love the school,

220
00:07:03,577 --> 00:07:04,511
and we just want to do our part.

221
00:07:04,578 --> 00:07:05,578
Right, Jimmy?

222
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:06,913
Yeah. Chirp, chirp.

223
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:08,741
That's what crickets say. Cricket!

224
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:12,752
A cricket can make whatever
sound you want it to make.

225
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,321
- Okay.
- Okay. No, it can't.

226
00:07:14,388 --> 00:07:16,823
- It makes a very specific sound.
- Yeah.

227
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:18,692
Hey, kid. Hey.

228
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:21,328
You like candy? Well, I like names.

229
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:23,296
Which one of these punks bit Edie?

230
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:27,534
That's your plan... shaking down toddlers?

231
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:29,669
I'm being perfectly reasonable.
I'm just trying to get a name

232
00:07:29,737 --> 00:07:31,471
so we can talk to the kid's parents.

233
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:33,039
Oh, but if you're not comfortable

234
00:07:33,107 --> 00:07:35,041
with the duties of an emergency contact...

235
00:07:35,109 --> 00:07:37,344
I see what you're doing
here. Don't try to bait me

236
00:07:37,411 --> 00:07:39,446
into participating in your chicanery,

237
00:07:39,513 --> 00:07:41,381
in your tomfoolery, in your...

238
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:44,351
"On Tuesday, Hungry
Hedgehog ate one cupcake,

239
00:07:44,418 --> 00:07:46,553
two carrots, and bit a
classmate on the arm."

240
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,122
Has anyone here bit a
classmate on the arm? Anyone?

241
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,291
That's not how the book goes.

242
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:53,026
Well, when you're the Helper Cricket,

243
00:07:53,094 --> 00:07:54,461
you can read the book any way you want.

244
00:07:54,528 --> 00:07:55,862
I hate you.

245
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,297
Hey, sweetie.

246
00:07:57,365 --> 00:07:58,398
Let's solve a mystery together.

247
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:00,300
Do you know who bit Edie?

248
00:08:00,368 --> 00:08:03,737
My cat bit my dog and
my dog yelled like this.

249
00:08:03,804 --> 00:08:06,573
All right, that's great.
Get out of here. Next.

250
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,410
So... this is what the
biter looks like, huh?

251
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:12,379
I can work with this.

252
00:08:12,446 --> 00:08:13,747
Mm-hmm.

253
00:08:13,814 --> 00:08:15,415
Hi, sweetie. Let's solve

254
00:08:15,483 --> 00:08:17,984
a mystery together. Do
you know who bit Edie?

255
00:08:18,052 --> 00:08:19,252
Maybe a ghost?

256
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,487
Is this a joke to you?

257
00:08:21,956 --> 00:08:22,989
Smile.

258
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,458
Did you bite Edie?

259
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:26,459
Hey!

260
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:30,196
I like swinging, don't you?

261
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:32,632
You like biting? You
ever just, uh, bite a kid?

262
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:35,568
You're right... this didn't work.

263
00:08:35,636 --> 00:08:37,837
Guess I forgot how stupid kids are.

264
00:08:37,905 --> 00:08:41,007
Sorry you came up empty, but
I've got some promising leads.

265
00:08:41,075 --> 00:08:43,009
I heard you're looking for a biter.

266
00:08:44,612 --> 00:08:46,246
I'll sing for you.

267
00:08:46,313 --> 00:08:48,448
But it don't come cheap.

268
00:08:48,516 --> 00:08:50,617
Oh, my God, she's the same
age as the rest of them,

269
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:51,885
yet she speaks like us.

270
00:08:51,952 --> 00:08:53,353
This is really cool.

271
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:55,288
What do you want for it, kid?

272
00:08:55,356 --> 00:08:57,357
My name is Clementine.

273
00:08:57,425 --> 00:08:58,625
And I want a sand castle.

274
00:08:58,692 --> 00:09:00,427
A good one.

275
00:09:00,494 --> 00:09:04,397
But you better be quick,
because recess is almost over.

276
00:09:04,465 --> 00:09:06,800
How are you at sand castles?

277
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,571
Nice moat work.

278
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:13,473
When did you get so good
at building sand castles?

279
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,108
I've always been artistic.
I'm just shy about it.

280
00:09:15,176 --> 00:09:16,476
Oh, that's right,

281
00:09:16,544 --> 00:09:20,113
I forgot what a sensitive creature you are.

282
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:22,148
You have a bandage in your hair.

283
00:09:22,216 --> 00:09:23,950
Ew! Yuck. Get it out, get it out.

284
00:09:24,018 --> 00:09:25,585
Ooh, sorry.

285
00:09:25,653 --> 00:09:28,154
Don't worry, I got you.

286
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,557
Thank you.

287
00:09:30,624 --> 00:09:31,491
This'll do.

288
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,426
This'll do just fine.

289
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:36,563
Dragon attack!

290
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,565
- Oh!
- Oh!

291
00:09:38,632 --> 00:09:41,067
My moat, my moat!

292
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:43,336
Hey, wait a minute... we need a name.

293
00:09:43,404 --> 00:09:44,604
Who's the biter?

294
00:09:44,672 --> 00:09:46,172
Alex is!

295
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,575
Alex. Our work here is done.

296
00:09:48,642 --> 00:09:51,678
Wrong, rookie. It's just begun.

297
00:09:51,745 --> 00:09:53,513
I like this side of you.

298
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:56,282
You're like a badass chick
on Criminal Mind or something.

299
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,618
All right entrepre-nerds,

300
00:09:58,686 --> 00:10:00,253
let's hear your pitch.

301
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:02,288
Pretend I'm Kirk. Okay?

302
00:10:02,356 --> 00:10:04,591
Okay.

303
00:10:04,658 --> 00:10:05,592
Hi Kirk, nice to meet you...

304
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:06,826
Stop right there. Nice?

305
00:10:06,894 --> 00:10:08,027
You know what's nice?

306
00:10:08,095 --> 00:10:09,629
Homemade jam.

307
00:10:09,697 --> 00:10:11,164
Guys, this is Kirk freaking Kelly.

308
00:10:11,232 --> 00:10:12,265
He is the jam.

309
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,666
Not to mention my boy.

310
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:14,734
Let's start over.

311
00:10:14,768 --> 00:10:15,869
Okay.

312
00:10:17,104 --> 00:10:19,205
Right.

313
00:10:19,273 --> 00:10:20,974
Hi, Kirk, it's an honor to meet you...

314
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,642
Stop. Don't suck up.

315
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,010
Guys, come on!

316
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:25,612
This ain't no disco.

317
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,880
This ain't no country club either.

318
00:10:26,947 --> 00:10:28,181
This is Kirk Kelly.

319
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:29,883
Does he know that... I don't think so.

320
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,718
You got to be on point.
You got to be on your toes.

321
00:10:31,785 --> 00:10:33,686
You got to think fa... Aah! Ooh.

322
00:10:33,754 --> 00:10:35,455
That was impressively fast.

323
00:10:35,523 --> 00:10:37,624
Why are you being so intense about this?

324
00:10:37,691 --> 00:10:38,837
I mean, if Kirk's your
boy, it shouldn't matter.

325
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:39,516
Uh, there's no "if" there.

326
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,694
If I have a son, I'm gonna name him Kirk.

327
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:43,630
And I'll never love him as
much as I love Kirk Kelly.

328
00:10:43,697 --> 00:10:45,398
Wh... You're guaranteeing right now

329
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:47,867
that if you have a kid, you will
love him less than Kirk Kelly.

330
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,702
- That's what I said.
- What?

331
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,870
All right, now, let's try this again

332
00:10:50,938 --> 00:10:52,305
from the top. And by the way,

333
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:54,541
it's "Kirk," not "Kirk."

334
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:56,309
Uh, okay... Kirk.

335
00:10:56,377 --> 00:10:57,644
Better. Now think fast...

336
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,314
Thank you so much

337
00:11:01,382 --> 00:11:03,016
for having Alex over.

338
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,585
It's rare the grandparents host a playdate.

339
00:11:05,653 --> 00:11:06,719
It's not that rare.

340
00:11:06,787 --> 00:11:08,021
Yeah, it happens all the time.

341
00:11:08,088 --> 00:11:10,323
I just have to ask, though,

342
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:13,393
is Edie gonna stay in the
playpen the whole time?

343
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,563
Oh, about that. We may be old school,

344
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,398
but we prefer Edie to play with kids

345
00:11:18,465 --> 00:11:20,166
that don't try to eat her.

346
00:11:20,234 --> 00:11:21,754
- I'm sorry?
- That's right...

347
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,026
Alex bit Edie twice.

348
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,171
This whole playdate thing

349
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:27,407
was a brilliant ruse.

350
00:11:27,474 --> 00:11:29,008
A playdate with grandparents?

351
00:11:29,076 --> 00:11:31,044
Come on. Think, Brenda.

352
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:33,713
I am so sorry. Alex,

353
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:35,782
what did we say?

354
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:38,618
If you acted out one
more time, no Disneyland.

355
00:11:38,686 --> 00:11:39,953
Maybe next year, bud.

356
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,754
This'll never happen again.

357
00:11:41,822 --> 00:11:43,189
I think Alex is misbehaving

358
00:11:43,257 --> 00:11:46,626
because his grandfather passed.

359
00:11:46,694 --> 00:11:48,661
That's why he hasn't
been in school all week.

360
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:52,432
Edie was bitten yesterday.

361
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:55,301
Let it go. We're in too deep.

362
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:57,537
Alex, it's Mickey Mouse on the phone.

363
00:11:57,605 --> 00:11:59,172
He says he's very unhappy with you.

364
00:12:01,842 --> 00:12:03,076
- Look at his eyes.
- Stay strong.

365
00:12:03,143 --> 00:12:04,544
Oh...

366
00:12:06,113 --> 00:12:08,314
I can't believe Clementine lied.

367
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:10,717
Well, anyone who destroys
a castle that beautiful

368
00:12:10,784 --> 00:12:12,652
- can't be trusted.
- Yeah.

369
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,621
So... back to the school tomorrow?

370
00:12:14,688 --> 00:12:16,923
Biter's got to be out there somewhere.

371
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:19,259
I don't know. Maybe we should hang it up.

372
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:20,460
Really?

373
00:12:20,527 --> 00:12:22,595
Yeah, we did the vigilante thing

374
00:12:22,663 --> 00:12:24,897
and just destroyed a
three-year-old's vacation.

375
00:12:24,965 --> 00:12:27,734
Well, don't worry, I slipped
Alex a 20 on his way out.

376
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:28,701
Ugh.

377
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:31,571
I'll talk to the school again.

378
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,072
It'll probably be fine.

379
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,641
You think?

380
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,909
This was kind of fun, though.

381
00:12:36,977 --> 00:12:39,512
Yeah, we did have fun.

382
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,814
Who's that? Who's that?

383
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:44,751
Oh. Hey, hey! Scott has docked,

384
00:12:44,818 --> 00:12:47,687
so looks like tomorrow night is on.

385
00:12:47,755 --> 00:12:50,189
Oh, cool... small boat guy.

386
00:12:50,257 --> 00:12:51,658
Whoo-hoo.

387
00:12:51,725 --> 00:12:54,731
Hello, Scotland Yard.

388
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:58,831
Uh, it's a Sherlock Holmes reference.

389
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:00,833
No, no, no, no. It's fine.

390
00:13:00,901 --> 00:13:02,268
Well, he's hot. Leave me alone.

391
00:13:02,336 --> 00:13:04,704
Yeah, tomorrow's good. I can't wait.

392
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,074

393
00:13:15,321 --> 00:13:17,756
Ravi, I see you're
working your usual corner.

394
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:19,424
What's a billion dollars get me?

395
00:13:19,492 --> 00:13:21,460
Kirk, man.

396
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:23,862
Dude, I'm glad you made it. I
was gonna tell you to Waze it

397
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,431
and then I'm like, "Uh, smarten
up, Ravi, this is the guy

398
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:28,567
who invented technol..."

399
00:13:29,702 --> 00:13:30,902
Oh... You got me, man.

400
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,304
No, I deserved it.

401
00:13:32,372 --> 00:13:33,939
I was being long-winded
and boring. Come here.

402
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:35,907
Whoa.

403
00:13:35,975 --> 00:13:37,376
Hey, Kirk, it's so
exciting to meet you, man.

404
00:13:37,443 --> 00:13:39,670
What, you want an autograph or something?

405
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:40,436
Sure.

406
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,972
- Dude, calm down, I'm not Jeremy Piven.
- Oh.

407
00:13:43,016 --> 00:13:44,177
- Then no.
- What, I'm not as

408
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:45,641
cool as Jeremy Piven to you?

409
00:13:45,685 --> 00:13:48,477
- What?
- Relax, I'm messing. Piven's a friend.

410
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:50,088
And you don't have to
kiss my ass. Ravi's mom

411
00:13:50,156 --> 00:13:51,890
took care of that before I got here, right?

412
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,592
Man, Kirk, when I don't
see you for a while,

413
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,994
I kind of forget what a
skank my mom is. Classic.

414
00:13:56,062 --> 00:13:57,062
Incoming.

415
00:13:57,063 --> 00:13:58,764
- Ooh.
- Ravi, grab those.

416
00:13:58,831 --> 00:13:59,852
You like to be on your knees, huh?

417
00:13:59,877 --> 00:14:00,489
You know I do. Hey!

418
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:02,334
Like my mom, right?

419
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:03,969
Is he always like this?

420
00:14:04,037 --> 00:14:05,270
Like what... hilarious?

421
00:14:05,338 --> 00:14:06,805
He seems like he's the worst.

422
00:14:06,873 --> 00:14:08,640
Yeah, the worst at not being the best.

423
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,576
You know, you remind me of my stepbrother.

424
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:13,178
Oh, is he awesome?

425
00:14:13,246 --> 00:14:15,681
No, no, he's in jail for stalking Oprah.

426
00:14:15,748 --> 00:14:18,684
Anyway, let's get inside so
you guys can buy me dinner.

427
00:14:19,552 --> 00:14:20,552
Yeah.

428
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:26,024
Hey.

429
00:14:26,092 --> 00:14:28,427
I need your credit card so I can send Alex

430
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:30,462
those anonymous Disneyland tickets.

431
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,097
Preschool yearbook?

432
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:33,465
Eh, at least you're reading.

433
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:34,833
So close to catching this guy.

434
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:36,421
Or girl. The biter could be either sex.

435
00:14:36,436 --> 00:14:38,103
You're still on this?

436
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:40,972
Yes, of course. I'm nothing
if not a champion of justice.

437
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,307
You've stolen bathrobes

438
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,176
from every luxury hotel chain in America.

439
00:14:44,243 --> 00:14:45,777
Yeah, here, here, here, here, here, here...

440
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:47,179
- Good-bye.
- Thank you.

441
00:14:47,246 --> 00:14:48,801
I wish Sara was here to help me.

442
00:14:48,826 --> 00:14:49,505
Whatever.

443
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:51,516
Just text me the address
for Alex's parents.

444
00:14:51,584 --> 00:14:53,185
Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait.

445
00:14:53,252 --> 00:14:54,720
Say that again.

446
00:14:54,787 --> 00:14:56,521
- Which part?
- Alex's parents.

447
00:14:56,589 --> 00:14:58,490
When I asked who the
biter was, Clementine said,

448
00:14:58,558 --> 00:15:00,992
"Alex is." Alex is. Alex is.

449
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,695
Alex is. Alexis. Alexis. Alexis!

450
00:15:03,763 --> 00:15:05,163
Alexis!

451
00:15:05,231 --> 00:15:07,499
Aha!

452
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:09,134
Gotcha.

453
00:15:09,202 --> 00:15:10,836
CoParentPro isn't just gonna change

454
00:15:10,903 --> 00:15:12,537
the way single parents communicate.

455
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:15,140
It's gonna change the entire
concept of co-parenting.

456
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,309
Not to mention 128-bit encryption

457
00:15:17,377 --> 00:15:19,144
and cloud syncing capability.

458
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:21,146
Which are words I know.

459
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:23,415
What did I tell you? My
girl's like Steve Wozniak!

460
00:15:23,483 --> 00:15:25,083
You're like Steve Blobs.

461
00:15:25,151 --> 00:15:27,185
Yeah, 'cause it's like Steve Jobs.

462
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:29,087
It's a good one.

463
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:30,856
It's okay to laugh when I'm funny.

464
00:15:33,593 --> 00:15:36,228
It's classic!

465
00:15:36,295 --> 00:15:39,231
Um... but, uh, you-you know, the beauty

466
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:41,433
of CoParentPro is that it seamlessly merges

467
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:45,237
every aspect of childcare, so,
be it schedules, appointments,

468
00:15:45,304 --> 00:15:47,038
- meals, schoolwork...
- Mm-hmm.

469
00:15:47,106 --> 00:15:48,407
So that even if both parents
aren't under the same roof,

470
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:49,674
they'll be on...

471
00:15:49,742 --> 00:15:51,676
the same page.

472
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:53,278
It's like the next Google.

473
00:15:53,346 --> 00:15:54,513
I have a question.

474
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,248
- Please.
- So...

475
00:15:56,315 --> 00:15:58,083
the two of you...

476
00:15:58,151 --> 00:16:00,018
had a baby together?

477
00:16:01,254 --> 00:16:02,754
Yeah.

478
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:04,456
So, how did this happen?

479
00:16:04,524 --> 00:16:06,124
What, did he Revenge of the Nerds you

480
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:08,059
with a Darth Vader mask?

481
00:16:08,127 --> 00:16:10,462
Listen, Kirk, I don't know
what you're insinuating here,

482
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,230
because I've only seen Nerds in Paradise...

483
00:16:12,298 --> 00:16:14,366
Oh, don't get offended.
I'm just asking the question

484
00:16:14,434 --> 00:16:16,568
everyone who's ever met you wants to know.

485
00:16:16,636 --> 00:16:18,203
Th-This is ridiculous.

486
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:19,571
You're not even listening to the pitch.

487
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:21,106
Oh, you mean the pitch that told me

488
00:16:21,174 --> 00:16:22,307
you have next to no experience in tech,

489
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,875
no proof-of-concept or sales,

490
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:25,277
yet you're valuing your company at 100K?

491
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:27,078
So between all those hilarious insults,

492
00:16:27,146 --> 00:16:28,647
you were listening.

493
00:16:28,714 --> 00:16:30,382
It's good multi-tasking.

494
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,010
Well, now that you know I am listening,

495
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:33,385
why don't you pitch it out again

496
00:16:33,453 --> 00:16:35,293
and see if you can address
some of my concerns?

497
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,723
Hey! Finally.

498
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:39,791
Where you been?

499
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,560
I was in the shower.

500
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:43,595
Are you the idiot who's been
calling every 30 seconds?

501
00:16:43,663 --> 00:16:45,597
No, I'm the idiot who cracked the case.

502
00:16:45,665 --> 00:16:47,299
I got a name and an address.

503
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:49,067
Seriously? That's amazing!

504
00:16:49,135 --> 00:16:50,335
Meet me in Hancock Park.

505
00:16:50,403 --> 00:16:52,170
We'll wait for the biter's parents

506
00:16:52,238 --> 00:16:53,572
to come home, we'll give
them a good talking to.

507
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,840
It'll be like an old-fashioned stakeout.

508
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:56,842
I have the Scott thing, remember?

509
00:16:56,909 --> 00:16:59,277
Oh, right. Small boat guy.

510
00:16:59,345 --> 00:17:01,913
All right, I guess I can fly solo.

511
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:04,015
No, we're a team. Send me the address.

512
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,617
I've got an hour.

513
00:17:05,685 --> 00:17:07,285
And I'm doing my makeup in the car!

514
00:17:07,353 --> 00:17:08,987
Great. I'll bring snacks.

515
00:17:09,055 --> 00:17:10,589
Ooh, I love snacks!

516
00:17:12,692 --> 00:17:16,194
If I didn't know any better, I'd
say you're preparing for a date.

517
00:17:16,262 --> 00:17:19,798
Date? What? I'm not preparing for a date.

518
00:17:19,866 --> 00:17:21,833
I'm making some food for the car.

519
00:17:21,901 --> 00:17:24,102
You're grating a truffle, Jimmy.

520
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,305
Are you implying that...?

521
00:17:27,373 --> 00:17:29,474
You need to lay off the reefer, man.

522
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:31,409
What?! Yeah, perhaps I should.

523
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:33,478
Date.

524
00:17:33,546 --> 00:17:35,480
Have fun with Sara.

525
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:44,214
Mer dating a guy with a boat

526
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:46,049
'cause you can't wear heels on the dock.

527
00:17:46,116 --> 00:17:48,184
- I had to go with wedges.
- Yeah, wedges are good.

528
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,853
Is everything okay?

529
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:52,655
You would never approve wedges.

530
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:54,190
Yeah. No. I'm just...

531
00:17:54,258 --> 00:17:55,858
We need to stay focused now.

532
00:17:55,926 --> 00:17:59,229
I think Alexis's parents
should be home in 20 minutes.

533
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:00,763
What?

534
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,198
Can we really call this a stakeout

535
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:04,167
if we know exactly when
they're coming home?

536
00:18:04,235 --> 00:18:06,903
- Not really.
- It's more like we're early.

537
00:18:06,971 --> 00:18:08,438
Right.

538
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,240
What are we doing?

539
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:12,187
We're in a parked car,
watching someone's house,

540
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:15,578
eating prosciutto di melone.

541
00:18:15,646 --> 00:18:17,280
I think we're the crazy grandparents.

542
00:18:17,348 --> 00:18:19,048
You could make that argument.

543
00:18:19,116 --> 00:18:21,050
Here. Try the burrata.

544
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,254
Oh, my God.

545
00:18:24,321 --> 00:18:25,922
- That is amazing!
- Mm-hmm.

546
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,523
Would it be terrible to say

547
00:18:27,591 --> 00:18:30,026
that Edie getting bitten
was worth it for this food?

548
00:18:30,094 --> 00:18:31,594
Yes, that would be terrible.

549
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:34,797
What will you make if she
gets pushed off a swing?

550
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:35,932
Oh.

551
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,267
Crab cakes.

552
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:39,736
Lemon aioli, pair it
with a nice Chardonnay.

553
00:18:39,803 --> 00:18:41,271
Not bad, not bad.

554
00:18:41,338 --> 00:18:42,764
I'm not hearing anything about a dessert.

555
00:18:42,765 --> 00:18:44,307
Mm!

556
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,808
You know what I'd make?

557
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,543
You like... Remember in the old days

558
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:50,936
- you'd love...
- Scott said he's ready to meet up.

559
00:18:50,981 --> 00:18:52,482
♪ When we were young... ♪

560
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:55,618
I don't really want to
drive out to Marina Del Rey.

561
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:58,221
Then you have to be in Marina Del Rey.

562
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:00,290
Maybe I should just cancel and stay here.

563
00:19:00,357 --> 00:19:02,592
♪ When you were young... ♪

564
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,061
No, go on the date.

565
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:07,063
Scott seems promising.

566
00:19:07,131 --> 00:19:08,298
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

567
00:19:08,365 --> 00:19:10,166
You're on board with small boat guy?

568
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:14,437
You know what they say,
small boat, big... potential.

569
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:16,272
I hate to say it,

570
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,174
but the old version of
that line was funnier.

571
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:21,010
All right.

572
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:23,946
I'm off to Marina Del Rey. Blech.

573
00:19:24,014 --> 00:19:25,581

In conclusion, our market analysis

577
00:19:35,326 --> 00:19:37,193
and real-world experience make it clear

578
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:39,095
that CoParentPro will be

579
00:19:39,163 --> 00:19:40,596
an unqualified success.

580
00:19:40,664 --> 00:19:43,099
I hope we've addressed all your concerns.

581
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:45,234
I'm impressed.

582
00:19:45,235 --> 00:19:46,469
You actually have.

583
00:19:46,537 --> 00:19:48,304
Oh, except for one.

584
00:19:48,372 --> 00:19:50,039
Is looking at your baby a daily reminder

585
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:51,907
of the most terrible
mistake you've ever made?

586
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,182
Okay, we're done here.

587
00:19:53,243 --> 00:19:54,644
- Thank God.
- What?

588
00:19:54,712 --> 00:19:56,979
You know, I've waited a long time

589
00:19:57,047 --> 00:19:58,648
to get paid to do something that
I love, and you have the money

590
00:19:58,716 --> 00:20:00,316
to make it happen, but it doesn't matter,

591
00:20:00,351 --> 00:20:02,652
'cause I don't do business with douchebags.

592
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,705
- Mm.
- And for the record,

593
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:04,478
Vanessa has made

594
00:20:04,521 --> 00:20:06,241
- way worse mistakes than me.
- That's true.

595
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,125
Yup. It's time for you to go, Kirk.

596
00:20:09,193 --> 00:20:10,193
What, are you serious?

597
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,028
Yeah. Go away.

598
00:20:12,096 --> 00:20:13,129
Have a nice night.

599
00:20:13,197 --> 00:20:16,899
Don't tell me what to do.

600
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:18,368
Aah! All right, look, it's obvious

601
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:20,370
you guys can't take a joke, slash my jokes

602
00:20:20,437 --> 00:20:22,905
probably don't make me as
cool as I think they do.

603
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:26,042
But anyway, your app's
a winner, and I'm in.

604
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,844
Well, we are not.

605
00:20:27,911 --> 00:20:29,812
What if I give you double the seed money?

606
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:33,822
It's too late, Kirk. Get
it through your skull.

607
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:35,213
- Yeah.
- You're gonna have to take

608
00:20:35,238 --> 00:20:36,410
that seed money and shove it

609
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:37,520
- right up...
- We're in!

610
00:20:37,588 --> 00:20:38,354
What? What?

611
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:42,358
Hug me, brother! Yes!

612
00:20:42,426 --> 00:20:43,726
It's the tech industry.

613
00:20:43,794 --> 00:20:45,474
We're gonna have to do business with jerks.

614
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:47,497
At least this jerk gave
us double our seed money.

615
00:20:47,564 --> 00:20:48,998
Yeah, I told you you'd like him.

616
00:20:49,066 --> 00:20:50,566
Ah, good job, lobs.

617
00:20:53,971 --> 00:20:56,839
What am I doing here?

618
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:59,509
Well, Sara left, and I
didn't want to be a grown man

619
00:20:59,576 --> 00:21:02,412
sitting out alone in
front of a child's home.

620
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:03,479
Oh!

621
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,983
There's Alexis's parents. Come on.

622
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,621
Hey! Your kid bit my granddaughter!

623
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:15,124
Oh, well, that means your
kid spat in my kid's face!

624
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:16,859
The school wouldn't tell us who it was.

625
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:19,028
Ah. Call it even, then?

626
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:21,431
No, no, no, no... what's
your granddaughter's name?

627
00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:23,466
Uh... Clementine.

628
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:25,802
She hangs out in the sandbox.

629
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:28,271
Snitch had it coming.
