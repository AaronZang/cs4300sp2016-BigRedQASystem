6
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,807
MADRID, NOVEMBER OF 1955

7
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,086
HOLD-UP!

8
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,767
PANAMA, THREE WEEKS EARLIER

9
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,921
We're not selling them,
we're pawning them.

10
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,726
They're Evita's jewels!
How can we pawn them?

11
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,445
We're out of money.

12
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,440
We'll need it to get Peron
settled in Madrid.

13
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,570
Sorry to keep you waiting.

14
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,365
Have you got the key?

15
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,001
Please ring the bell
when you're ready.

16
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,361
Thank you very much.

17
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,885
The general will slit your throat,
Landa.

18
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,605
He doesn't need to know.

19
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,441
We're in Panama,
everybody knows everybody here.

20
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,961
I'm meeting in Madrid on Tuesday

21
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,323
to negotiate political asylum
for the general.

22
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,410
I'll pawn them while I'm there.

23
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,090
What if he wants to see them?

24
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,520
He gets nostalgic...

25
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,610
He'll be distracted by the trip
to Spain.

26
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,484
And once we're in Madrid,

27
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,480
if he asks us we'll say
they're being kept here, in Panama.

28
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,522
From now on,
this is your responsibility,

29
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,449
not mine. You got that?

30
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,483
Let me through, they're expecting me!

31
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,808
I said you can't go in there!

32
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,762
Merello!

33
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,041
Come on.

34
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,681
- It's okay, he's with me.
- You see?

35
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,562
Why are you so late?

36
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,602
They wouldn't give me the car
without paying.

37
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,369
- I told Buscaglia.
- Okay, Merello.

38
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,927
I told him yesterday
and again this morning.

39
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,521
Okay, forget it, don't worry about it.

40
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,406
What's wrong?

41
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,641
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

42
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,521
You know him?

43
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,687
No.

44
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,842
Go inside quietly, keep the lights off
and hide that.

45
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,963
One move and you're dead.

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,047
No, no...

47
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,370
Should I raise my hands?

48
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,721
Are you alone?

49
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,887
Yes.

50
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,250
Wait, wait, wait...

51
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,967
Don't move. What do you want?
Who are you looking for?

52
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,401
- Moises Landa.
- What for?

53
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,568
- Are you him?
- I'm asking the questions.

54
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,683
- What do you want him for?
- I need to talk to him.

55
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,126
He's not here.

56
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,163
Well, I'll wait for him.

57
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,643
You can't stay here.

58
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,891
What are you gonna do, kill me?

59
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,968
- Moises Landa?
- What do you want?

60
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,049
To talk to you. Can I...?

61
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,521
Go ahead.

62
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,127
My...

63
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,569
My mom sent me.

64
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,811
Matilde Jordan.

65
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,169
Matilde Jordan is your mother?

66
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,048
Since the day I was born.

67
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,287
Can I...?

68
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,082
You already know her.
The boy is me.

69
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,721
It's okay, Merello.

70
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,083
Don't worry,
he's the son of a friend.

71
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,008
You sure?

72
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,361
Yeah.

73
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,683
How is Matilde?

74
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,962
She misses me, but...

75
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,442
things got complicated in Argentina

76
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,610
- for patriots and I had to leave.
- You're a Peronist?

77
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,767
Until I die.

78
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,530
What are you doing here?

79
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,202
My mom said you might be able
to help me find work.

80
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,640
What can you do?

81
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,602
I do a variety act.

82
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,249
It's based on Chaplin.

83
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,525
With my hat and cane and my hands free
people crap themselves.

84
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,490
You know Happy Land?

85
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,441
The cabaret by the port?

86
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,687
I've been here two days.

87
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,081
Come on.

88
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,923
Go in there tomorrow

89
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,362
and ask for the manager, Almagro.

90
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,250
Have you eaten?

91
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,045
Not for a couple days.

92
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,481
Like Chaplin in "The Gold Flush."
Have you seen it?

93
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,567
No.

94
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,330
Well, you should...

95
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,442
Here.

96
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,286
Buy yourself something.
And remember: Almagro.

97
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,882
Luis Almagro.
Tell him I sent you.

98
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,209
I'll make you look good, Landa.
You won't regret this.

99
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,923
Go and get some rest.

100
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,042
Okay.

101
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,401
Good evening.

102
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,847
Bye.

103
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,961
What is it?

104
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,526
Nothing...

105
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,925
Could I see them?

106
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,411
See what?

107
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,088
Evita's jewels.

108
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,610
You remember?

109
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,609
You got to see her show them off
while guarding her.

110
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,721
No, no.

111
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,489
My back was always turned,
keeping watch.

112
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,722
Face to face,
I only saw her once.

113
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,246
What a marvel.

114
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,886
She wore that one when she came
to Spain on her official visit.

115
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,730
She looked like a movie star.

116
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,609
She was one of those people
who have their own glow.

117
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,849
She wore that one
when she met Pope Pius XII.

118
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,203
Just imagine. They're the general's
good luck charm.

119
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,121
Just thinking about parting with them
makes me ill.

120
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,203
- They're very special.
- Yes.

121
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,971
But this is a jeweler's,
not a pawnshop.

122
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,609
We'd pay interest for the scam.

123
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,211
- The what?
- For the deal.

124
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,526
For pawning them.

125
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,165
Yes, of course.

126
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,211
Twenty percent.

127
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,126
Ferran...

128
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,721
Of how much?

129
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,845
Of five million.

130
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,411
You had promised me more money.

131
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,090
It's all I can offer you

132
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,490
They're Evita Peron's jewels!

133
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,320
All right.

134
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,682
Are you okay?

135
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,244
Yes, I'm fine.

136
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,607
Please.

137
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,129
- Shall I call you a taxi?
- No, don't bother.

138
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,084
Is there a pharmacy nearby?

139
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,523
Yes, across the street on the right.
You can't miss it.

140
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,166
- Mr. Ferran, it's for you.
- One moment.

141
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,203
- Watch the money.
- Yes, yes.

142
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,243
- If you don't mind...
- Go ahead.

143
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,408
Yes?

144
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,681
What's the matter?
Are you ill?

145
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,767
Breathe.

146
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,804
Breathe. Breathe.

147
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,447
Can I help?

148
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,608
- I don't know what's wrong with him.
- It's asthma.

149
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,121
- Are you sure?
- I'm a nurse at the Concepcion.

150
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,082
Stop that taxi.

151
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,880
It's all right, I'm going to help you
Relax.

152
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,487
Thank you.

153
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,045
Get in, get in.

154
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,009
He's awake.

155
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,125
How do you feel?

156
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,651
Where am I?

157
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,604
The Concepcion Clinic.

158
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,970
My briefcase...

159
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,650
Where is my briefcase?

160
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,205
What briefcase?

161
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,090
It's okay, don't move.

162
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,241
It's right here.

163
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,250
Has anyone opened it?

164
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,168
No. We don't open things here.

165
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,283
You saved my life.

166
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,811
Don't exaggerate.

167
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,526
I'd like to show you my gratitude
somehow.

168
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,848
- There's no need.
- I have to do something.

169
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,964
- Like what? No, really.
- Please, let me.

170
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,207
All right.

171
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,007
Sing me a tango.

172
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,967
Me?

173
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,201
I don't know how...

174
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,325
An Argentinean who can't sing tangos?
Too bad, I really like them.

175
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,965
There's a taxi coming.

176
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,209
I won't forget you.

177
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,045
That's what they all say.

178
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,050
- I'm not like everyone else.
- They all say that too.

179
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,762
Remember to always carry an extra.

180
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,202
Ferran is a good friend.

181
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,209
My wife's, especially.

182
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,611
Adela loves going to see him.

183
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,846
Did he make you a good offer?

184
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,566
How much did he offer?

185
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,280
Five million.

186
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,724
I wish I had that much.
Without Adela knowing.

187
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,366
Settling in Madrid
will be expensive.

188
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,564
We'll have to rent apartments,
furnish them, buy cars...

189
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,966
hire servants,

190
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,685
bodyguards...

191
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,688
You understand the general
can't live just anywhere.

192
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,167
Thanks, Juan.

193
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,687
Here.

194
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,447
Well, Landa...
Please, sit down.

195
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,527
Thank you.

196
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,042
The Spanish people
are very grateful to Argentina.

197
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,686
We'll never forget
the ships full of wheat

198
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,611
Peron sent us after the war.

199
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,167
- Our countries are brothers, Colonel.
- Yes.

200
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,125
And the Generalisimo
is well aware of that.

201
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,970
He admires Peron very much.

202
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,970
The general is fond of him as well.

203
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,049
Yes, but General Peron has been
excommunicated by the Holy Father

204
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,280
and this is a Roman Catholic country.

205
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,323
You understand
this isn't the best time

206
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,366
to grant him political asylum.

207
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,563
His asylum is going to take
a bit longer.

208
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,330
You said it was already done.

209
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,329
A few details are missing.

210
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,682
It'll be ready
by the end of the year.

211
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,405
These Spaniards...

212
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,968
The)I re real bastards.

213
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,686
In any case, don't tell the general.

214
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,720
How is he?

215
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,684
The same, depressed.

216
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,406
He listens to music all day
and talks about dead people.

217
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,647
Did he ask about me?

218
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,447
No.

219
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,844
I'm going to see him.

220
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,562
No.

221
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,887
Not now.

222
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,002
Is he asleep?

223
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,486
He's with the dancer.

224
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,728
He told me to see him
when I got back.

225
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,728
Later, or tomorrow.

226
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,851
Better yet, I'll call you.

227
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,331
Yes, it's me.

228
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,485
Fine, great.

229
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,527
What?

230
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,088
Carmen Polo, Franco's wife.
She loves to visit the jeweler's.

231
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,126
If she likes something, she has it sent
to the palace "to show it to Pace."

232
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,525
Who could refuse?

233
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,724
But she never sends it back,
and you can't send her a bill.

234
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,084
She heard about the jewels and
she made my employees show them to her.

235
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,442
And she loved them, of course.

236
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,085
Evita's jewels?

237
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,921
When I got there it was too late.
She was delighted.

238
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,088
She'd never seen anything
like them

239
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,521
and send them to the palace.

240
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,324
Ferran, those jewels aren't yours.

241
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,763
It's the Generalisimo's wife.

242
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,689
- Have you already sent them?
- No.

243
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,242
I said we had to fill out
the insurance forms

244
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,330
and that it would take at least
a week to ten days.

245
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,444
But she's in a hurry.
She really fancied them.

246
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,291
Ten days.

247
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,330
Merello. Where can I find him?

248
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,686
It's limp.

249
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,008
Go on, keep at it.

250
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,531
Who is it?

251
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,245
Landa, Merello.

252
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,249
One moment, please.

253
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,043
Sorry to just show up here like this,

254
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,607
- but it's urgent.
- Go ahead.

255
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,723
The general needs your help.

256
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,043
Anything for the general.

257
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,407
We have to rob a jewelry store,

258
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,409
but the jeweler will be in on it.

259
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,211
Then it's not a robbery.

260
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,243
Well, it'll have to look like one.

261
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,886
You're going to Madrid
to meet the jeweler.

262
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,321
- Madrid? In Spain?
- Yes.

263
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,045
Is there a problem?

264
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,522
No, no. You know me
better than anyone.

265
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,927
I've put my neck on the line
for the general

266
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,929
- plenty of times.
- Well, then?

267
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,811
It's just I've never been
on an airplane.

268
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,323
The general said you were
the right man

269
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,681
for the job.

270
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,286
He said that?

271
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,370
Shall we sit down?

272
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,160
Yes, yes.

273
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,641
You'll organize it with Ferran,
the jeweler.

274
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,288
You'll rob the store
and he'll give you Evita's jewels.

275
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,005
- Evita's jewels?
- Yes.

276
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,000
You'll take them and hide them
where he tells you,

277
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,441
then take the first flight
back to Panama.

278
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,041
We're stealing them to give them back?

279
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,045
What if we don't?

280
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,083
I gave my word.

281
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,524
Do you know anyone trustworthy
and experienced to back you up?

282
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,326
Willing to risk their neck
for the general?

283
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,444
No, Landa.
There aren't any patriots left.

284
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,924
- The kid?
- Yeah.

285
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,130
You're kidding, right?

286
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,608
- The first impression isn't good.
- The second isn't either.

287
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,288
He would do anything.

288
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,809
I can see that, Landa, but he doesn't
look very professional.

289
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,689
We don't need professionals, Merello.
We need patriots.

290
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,531
But I've never touched a gun
in my life.

291
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,166
- I didn't even like them as a boy.
- You see?

292
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,762
- You said you were an actor.
- He's not right for the job.

293
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,531
You're a Peronist.
You said you wouldn't let me down.

294
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,767
Well?

295
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,241
- I don't have to kill anyone?
- No.

296
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,687
- No shooting?
- No.

297
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,927
- No blood?
- None.

298
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,882
What if they resist?

299
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,686
They won't, the jeweler is in on it.

300
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,168
Oh, yeah?
Then why are we robbing him?

301
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,931
Oh, Jesus.
Come on, this guy's a schmuck.

302
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,611
Wait, wait.

303
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,805
When do we leave?

304
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,765
Marcelo Albino Tigerotti Costa.

305
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,970
What a fancy name!

306
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,521
And Alberto Orlando Bermejo.

307
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,522
- Uruguayan?
'Why Uruguayan?

308
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,324
I'll always be Argentinean.

309
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,124
Argentina is in here.

310
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,401
Until I die.

311
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,681
That's right.

312
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,363
Here are your tickets and visas.

313
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,846
You leave on Saturday.

314
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,203
So you get to Madrid on Sunday
and security will be more relaxed.

315
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,686
Why? What can happen?

316
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,527
When do we come back?

317
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,291
The following Sunday night
you come back from Madrid.

318
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,164
- What about guns?
- What guns?

319
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,681
Didn't you say the jeweler
was in on it?

320
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,370
Should we rob them with our fingers?

321
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,688
You'll get them once in Madrid.

322
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,723
This is for your expenses.

323
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,810
Get some coats. Madrid is cold.
And bring me a receipt for everything.

324
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,122
You know, I was thinking...

325
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,082
What's this Marcelo Albino like?

326
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,450
He's Uruguayan, that I know.
What I mean is...

327
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,690
his temperament. We can talk about your
character later, but mine is like...

328
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,927
What is he?

329
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,885
Is this guy a schmuck?

330
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,762
Down deep he's crafty, slippery...
A tough guy.

331
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,611
"Got a problem?
What are you two looking at?"

332
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,451
What's he like?

333
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,202
- I'll order another round.
- Please.

334
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,961
Here.

335
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,847
Edmundo Rivero. A legend.

336
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,930
Landa, you shouldn't have.

337
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,042
No.

338
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,765
I have a favor to ask.

339
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,883
When you're in Madrid
and you have time,

340
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,970
go to the Concepcion Clinic
and leave that with this note

341
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,369
at reception for Teresa Carvajal.

342
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,886
A friend.

343
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,450
A very friendly...

344
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,410
friend?

345
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,161
A friend.

346
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,649
If I'm not back in two weeks,
give this letter to Landa.

347
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,922
If you're not back?
Where are you going?

348
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,762
Classified business, in Madrid.

349
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,567
In Madrid?

350
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,200
I would love to live in Madrid.

351
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,331
Bring me back something.

352
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,530
You bet.

353
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,482
- What will you tell Almagro?
- I don't know, that I'm sick.

354
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,326
- We work sick here.
- That I sprained my ankle.

355
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,280
That's possible.

356
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,243
- Can I come in?
- Buscaglia!

357
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,362
- What brings you here?
- I'm here to see the artist.

358
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,649
The general asked about you again.

359
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,807
Did he?

360
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,447
Help yourself.

361
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,005
How pretty!

362
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,961
He's practically in love with you.

363
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,046
Like everybody else.

364
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,247
There he is.

365
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,765
I'll do the talking.
Don't say a word, okay?

366
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,810
Marcelo Albino 'Tigerotti
and Alberto Orlando Bermejo?

367
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,609
Yeah, both Uruguayan.

368
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,246
I'm...

369
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,290
When did you get to Madrid?

370
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,925
When we got here, that's all.

371
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,810
Have you ever been here?

372
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,728
No.

373
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,005
But I'd like to look around. Do you know
where the Concepcion Clinic is?

374
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,167
Are you ill?

375
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,966
- Knock it off, Marcelo Antonio.
- Albino.

376
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,969
Marcelo Albino, Uruguayan.

377
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,850
What time does it open?

378
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,883
- The clinic?
- The jewelry store.

379
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,920
At ten.

380
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,282
- How many employees?
- Three, and me.

381
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,289
Do they know about the robbery?

382
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,005
No, no.

383
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,051
- Have you got guns in the store?
- No, Jesus.

384
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,203
You won't be armed, will you?

385
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,209
Ever seen a robbery without guns?

386
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,449
- But you won't use them.
- Not if you follow our instructions.

387
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,642
When will you do it?

388
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,526
Because I visit clients after lunch
and it might be odd if...

389
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,007
It's better if I'm there, right?

390
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,009
Who will give me the jewels
if you aren't?

391
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,929
Yes, of course. Of course.

392
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,207
- When will you do it?
- On Saturday morning.

393
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,162
This Saturday?

394
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,645
Around what time?

395
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,411
- Where are Evita's jewels?
- In my office, in the safe.

396
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,046
Okay, here's what we'll do.

397
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,161
He stays with the employees,
you and I go to the office

398
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,443
and you give me Evita's jewels
while Marcelo...

399
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,483
Albino. Uruguayan.

400
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,966
...Grabs the window display.

401
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,844
No, that wasn't the deal.

402
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,691
It has to look like
a common robbery, Ferran.

403
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,611
If you give me only Evita's jewels,
people will doubt.

404
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,326
- You can't take my product.
- Not the good stuff.

405
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,170
It's all good.

406
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,443
If the insurance company
suspects something,

407
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,085
you'll be in trouble.

408
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,929
But you'll give it back, right?

409
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,645
Do we look like scumbags?

410
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,727
What?

411
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,523
We'll leave them at the house
with the others. Give me the keys.

412
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,487
Look, here are the directions.

413
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,606
- Have you got a car?
- Yes.

414
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,847
- No.
- Yes.

415
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,367
The door is hard to open,
you have to pull upwards.

416
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,887
Like this.

417
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,682
And take your shoes off before going in.
We just had the floor waxed.

418
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,085
And don't light the fireplace.

419
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,727
There are no neighbors but you can see
the smoke from far away.

420
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,445
And turn off the lights
when you leave.

421
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,567
And hide the keys under a pot
by the front door.

422
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,520
And leave everything
like you found it.

423
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,200
- Don't take anything, my wife...
- We're not here to nick anything.

424
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,128
What?

425
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,008
We're here to do justice.

426
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,885
Okay, but...

427
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,968
Do that again and I'll send you back.

428
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,003
- I wanted to help.
- Help by keeping quiet.

429
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,043
- Merello.
- You didn't hear me?

430
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,522
- What?
- Do you know how to drive?

431
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,960
Drive what?

432
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,447
- Can you watch?
- Watch what?

433
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,929
- Tell me if anyone's coming.
- What are you doing?

434
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,920
How will we get away, on a cable car?

435
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,691
- Merello, this is stealing.
- You don't say.

436
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,045
Merello. Merello...

437
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,641
- Do you ever shut up?
- Hey!

438
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,048
- What are you doing with my car?
- Nothing.

439
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,924
- Get out of there!
- You won't believe it.

440
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,963
We dropped a coin inside.

441
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,650
Open the door!

442
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,963
You'll have to go up
to the second floor.

443
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,561
- I'd like to leave this...
- One moment, please.

444
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,603
It's that way on the right.

445
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,771
Can I help you?

446
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,529
I'd like to leave this for a nurse
named Teresa Carvajal.

447
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,288
Teresa Carvajal,
please come to reception.

448
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,289
You didn't have to call her...

449
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,289
Wait, she'll be right down.

450
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,406
What is it, Lola?

451
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,443
This man asked for you.

452
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,403
You're Teresa Carvajal?

453
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,806
Yes, I am.

454
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,521
Can I help you?

455
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,203
He shouldn't have, I was joking.

456
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,200
Yes, he's a gentleman like all...
Uruguayans.

457
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,209
I thought he was Argentinean.

458
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,486
It's the same, Uruguayans,
Argentineans... We all like tango.

459
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,082
Is he a friend of yours?
A relative?

460
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,486
He's...

461
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,641
my father.

462
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,002
You two do look alike.

463
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,804
Yeah, sons sometimes resemble...

464
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,525
How's his asthma doing?

465
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,441
Fine.

466
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,725
Fine, fine... He handles it well.
He's hanging in there.

467
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,763
He must never forget his inhaler.

468
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,201
You know what he said?
That since he can't,

469
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,449
maybe I could take you out
to dance a tango.

470
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,601
In Madrid or Buenos Aires?

471
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,008
Or in Montevideo. Or China.

472
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,449
I mean here, in Madrid.
Or a tea-tea-tea, or a waltz, whatever.

473
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,206
You like to dance.

474
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,810
I'm sort of a dancer.

475
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,081
Me too.

476
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,209
What time do you get off?

477
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,448
I get off a little late today.

478
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,562
And tomorrow?

479
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,603
Or the day after, or the day after,

480
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,484
or the day after?

481
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,321
How about Friday?

482
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,081
- Okay, we have to go in.
- Why?

483
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,203
The display is blocking our view.

484
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,165
Yeah, but jewelry stores
are all the same on the inside.

485
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,728
It's better to know a place
before you knock it over.

486
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,241
- Knock it over?
- Wait here, okay?

487
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,521
We're not going together?

488
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,528
Ever see two men enter
a jewelry store together?

489
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,087
No, I've never been inside one.
Have you?

490
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,611
Plenty in Buenos Aires.

491
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,370
- Were you a jeweler?
- No, surveillance.

492
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,244
Why are you moving so much?

493
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,289
I need to take a leak.

494
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,362
Wait here, it'll only be a minute.

495
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,883
Good afternoon. Welcome.

496
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,130
Maribel, please...

497
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,644
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for a gift.

498
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,002
For your wife, mother,
mother-in-law, aunt?

499
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,247
For my wife.

500
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,130
What would she like?

501
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,403
A bracelet, earrings, broach, necklace?

502
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,090
A necklace maybe, yes.

503
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,408
- Do you like pearls?
- I love them.

504
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,728
I have some gorgeous pearls.
Just a moment.

505
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,407
Hi.

506
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,765
Good afternoon.

507
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,881
Yeah, um...

508
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,490
- Got any bracelets?
- Yes.

509
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,126
- Of course. Please.
- Can you show them to me?

510
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,891
- Yes. What kind of bracelet?
- A bathroom?

511
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,325
Excuse me?

512
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,885
A man's room.

513
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,891
- To...
- Yes. Please, follow me.

514
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,886
No, no. I have no record
of their arrival.

515
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,768
Wait a moment, I'll ask Maribel.
Don't hang up.

516
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,364
And this one has a silver closure.

517
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,006
Maribel, I have Prat from Linogar
on the phone and...

518
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,087
What?

519
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,767
Wow.

520
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,329
Go on, serve the gentleman.

521
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,845
Shall I show you the bracelets?

522
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,726
No, thank you. Actually
I've changed my mind. Thank you.

523
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,005
Which one do you like more?

524
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,931
- I'll think about it.
- Let me say one thing.

525
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,327
Pearls look wonderful on a woman.

526
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,366
Yes, I know. Thank you very much.
I'll come back. Goodbye.

527
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,609
I can't pee in the street.

528
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,644
Pee before you come to work.

529
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,810
This isn't my job.

530
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,730
Well, it's mine.

531
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,202
How did you get started in this?

532
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,488
I'll say this one last time.

533
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,729
We're here to get Evita's jewel's back.

534
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,766
Screw up one more time and I'll send you
back to your mommy, you got that?

535
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,487
Isaac Nudelman was a great guy.

536
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,242
Who?

537
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,601
What did you ask me?

538
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,124
Oh, we're going back to...

539
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,124
How you got started in this.

540
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,289
He was a great guy.
He had one arm.

541
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,769
But he was a good kid.

542
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,043
And he was ashamed of people knowing
his arm was missing.

543
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,205
That can't be easy.

544
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,171
Will you let me continue?

545
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,807
Go ahead.

546
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,643
He was really ashamed.

547
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,971
So he'd leave his empty sleeve
in his jacket pocket.

548
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,242
One day, I think it was the second day
of the strike at the market...

549
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,930
A soldier looked at him...

550
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,370
and called him over.

551
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,361
Once in front of him,
he ordered him to raise his arms.

552
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,804
And Nudelman obeyed him,
the poor kid.

553
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,241
He raised only his left arm.

554
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,681
What else could he do?

555
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,722
Are you telling the story or am I?

556
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,607
You are.

557
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,248
He raised his left arm...

558
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,331
and his empty sleeve stayed

559
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,126
in his jacket pocket
and the soldier thought

560
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,129
he was pulling a gun on him.

561
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,403
And shitting himself...

562
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,164
he shot him and killed him
on the spot.

563
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,847
Really?

564
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,490
Because he had only one arm.

565
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,570
I was there, watching.

566
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,560
I was just a kid, I don't know,
maybe ten years old.

567
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,446
And seeing death so up close...

568
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,568
changes your life.

569
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,569
But in my case...

570
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,329
I wasn't afraid of dying any more.

571
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,205
And that's how

572
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,890
I found my job.

573
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,927
What's wrong?

574
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,529
Tell me, Miguel.

575
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,405
How did you find yours?

576
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,648
- My what?
- Your job.

577
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,167
What job?

578
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,001
Aren't you an actor?

579
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,884
Oh, yeah, yeah.

580
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,082
When I was a kid

581
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,124
I didn't have a dad.
The thing is...

582
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,006
Well, yeah. I had a dad, it's just...
Okay, I'll keep going.

583
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,364
When I was a kid, I didn't have a dad.

584
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,325
- Well, I had one, but...
- It's me, Ferran, the jeweler!

585
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,602
- What are you doing here?
- Why did you come to the store?

586
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,249
You said you wouldn't be around
in the afternoon.

587
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,842
Well, today I was.
My God, when I saw you...

588
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,804
I said not to light the fireplace!

589
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,162
It's cold in the house, Ferran.

590
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,725
Oh, my God!

591
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,963
We'll leave everything
like it was.

592
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,288
What's that?
What will I tell my wife?

593
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,323
She loves this furniture!

594
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,370
And those bottles?
And your shoes!

595
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,449
I said to take off your shoes!
No, no, no.

596
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,404
You have to leave.
The robbery is off.

597
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,522
Bullshit.

598
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,762
What?

599
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,005
He said no.

600
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,720
It won't work.

601
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,285
I'll get nervous and...

602
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,090
Can't you see it's insane?
They saw you today

603
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,207
SQ?

604
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,287
They'll recognize you

605
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,563
Relax, Ferran.
Nobody will recognize us

606
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,650
It's not exactly what you asked for,

607
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,162
but it's happened before.
A movie filming

608
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,728
with cops and robbers coincides
with a zarzuela like "La Generala"

609
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,366
and we run out of uniforms.
What do you need them for?

610
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,045
It's...

611
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,685
a costume party.

612
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,166
Okay, then.

613
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,564
What are these?

614
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,444
Well, they're... formal attire

615
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,123
Will people who see them realize
they're army uniforms?

616
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,322
Of course.
When they see these buttons

617
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,286
and the stripes.
I have caps which match perfectly

618
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,767
Sweetie, bring me the caps!

619
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,531
Where are you from?

620
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,209
- Chile.
- Oh, Chile.

621
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,527
Francisca.

622
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,967
Thank you.

623
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,165
I don't know about your country,
but people here can't tell

624
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,285
one uniform from another.
Formal uniforms have presence

625
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,164
and plenty of authority.
We can add some medals if you like.

626
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,607
Do they work?

627
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,205
They just need cleaning.

628
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,130
Have you got spare parts?

629
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,487
Let me see.

630
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,485
The)I re not worth what you said.

631
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,809
- They are here.
- Oh, great.

632
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,171
They are here.

633
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,487
Perfect.

634
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,240
Wonderful.

635
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,489
Know what I'm gonna do?

636
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,440
I'm gonna pay you half
because the)I re not worth more.

637
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,923
Now it's four thousand.

638
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,367
Great.

639
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,449
It rose suddenly.

640
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,361
There you go.

641
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,283
Bullets, or do I shoot air?

642
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,846
Another hundred.

643
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,321
You know you're ripping me off,
right?

644
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,521
Another hundred.

645
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,811
- See him out.
- That's okay, asshole.

646
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,049
I know the way.

647
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,727
The dough.

648
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,527
The money.

649
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,402
The money.

650
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,325
Come on, come on!

651
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,207
Okay.

652
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,246
- It's not loaded.
- No? You wanna find out?

653
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,851
Son of a bitch!

654
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,084
Never insult the mother
of an Argentinean.

655
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,481
I didn't ask. It was the general
who said I should see them.

656
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,523
That's not possible.

657
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,371
Evita's jewels are being kept
in a safe deposit box

658
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,766
in a bank

659
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,769
and can't be taken out.

660
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,487
Yeah, but Buscaglia said
you have the key.

661
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,089
- You're a sight for sore eyes!
- Buscaglia.

662
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,769
I'm glad you made it.

663
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,806
The general is nervous.
He thought you weren't coming.

664
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,809
I would never do that to the general.

665
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,650
Go inside, he's expecting you.

666
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,403
He's in his office.

667
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,527
Buscaglia.

668
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,689
- We can't show people the jewels...
- What do you want me to do?

669
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,723
The general likes the girl.

670
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,491
He has a weakness for blondes,
you know that.

671
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:11,889
And it gets his mind off us
moving to Madrid.

672
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,685
I told you not to pawn them,
didn't I?

673
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,485
Everybody freeze.

674
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,962
Nobody move.

675
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,361
Hands up.

676
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,563
Hands up, this is a hold-up.

677
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,728
What are you doing?

678
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,201
I'm rehearsing...

679
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,290
Remember to use Spanish.

680
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,563
Yeah, I've been practicing.

681
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,091
You wanna hear?

682
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,762
Please stop making that noise.

683
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,450
You're driving me crazy.

684
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,086
Why clean it so much
if we're not going to shoot?

685
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,490
Hands up, this is hold-up!

686
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,283
Robbery

687
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,207
I'm going for a classical...
What?

688
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,811
They say "robbery," not "hold-up."

689
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,687
"Robbery?"

690
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,481
okay...

691
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,046
Hands up, this is a robbery.

692
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,647
- No, go ahead.
- More Spanish.

693
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,887
You know...

694
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,880
Nobody move. Don't make me
do something I'll regret.

695
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,322
What are you doing?

696
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,650
I can see my hand.
I see my finger and lose my focus.

697
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,083
Actor stuff.

698
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,203
Hands up, this is a robbery.

699
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,971
Say "bloody hell" and "bollocks."

700
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,521
"Bollocks" sounds good.
I'd rather leave Hell out of it...

701
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,122
Hands up, this is a robbery!
Bollocks!

702
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,004
Freeze or I'll shoot you
with my gun.

703
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,281
Bollocks.

704
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,287
Well?

705
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,802
Why did you steal another car?

706
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,651
Are you opening a dealership?

707
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,687
You have nothing to do?

708
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,927
No.

709
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,729
Change the letters.

710
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,123
- Not many Paraguayans come to Madrid.
- Uruguayans.

711
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,560
It's the same thing.

712
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,047
Sure, right.

713
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,801
Plenty of Argentineans though.

714
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,161
Yeah, there are more of them.

715
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,161
I don't like them very much.

716
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,202
You don't?

717
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,402
No, because... Eva Peron,

718
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,001
for example.
She was here a few years back.

719
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,167
Yeah.

720
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,523
She seemed...
Franco's wife is a lady,

721
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,006
you can just tell.

722
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,009
But Peron's wife was vulgar.

723
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:21,962
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

724
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,807
She's cheeky.
You know what I mean.

725
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,003
Franco's wife picked up on it.

726
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,008
What a strange man!

727
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,690
What did you do to him?

728
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,770
I'll tell you later.

729
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,082
You're leaving?

730
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,087
Yeah.

731
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,243
You don't like Teresa's friend?

732
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,407
No.

733
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,928
I'll get my things and come with you.

734
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,646
No, stay. Don't stay late,
tomorrow we have stuff to do.

735
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,247
What's wrong?

736
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,648
Nothing, he had stuff to do.

737
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,561
This late?

738
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,282
Yeah. I'm sorry about your friend.

739
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,288
My friend?

740
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,925
Look at her.

741
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,290
You don't have stuff to do?

742
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,569
Dance with you.

743
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,161
Only if you tell me
why you're in Madrid.

744
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,602
Work.

745
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,642
What work?

746
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,883
I'll tell you after this dance.

747
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,441
- Do it again.
- No.

748
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,927
- Come on.
- No, no.

749
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,201
Last time, I swear.

750
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,447
- Last time?
- Yes.

751
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,041
Only if you give me a kiss.

752
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,800
All right.

753
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,121
Goon.

754
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,210
You live around here?

755
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,561
Nearby.

756
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,449
This happens to be
where I met your father.

757
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,602
Come on.

758
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,001
How pretty.

759
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,200
And my kiss?

760
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,568
If you buy me something.

761
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,371
Then it'll have to be two kisses.

762
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,531
Pick one.

763
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,047
The clover.

764
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,363
For good luck.

765
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,531
Here you are.

766
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,161
So you never forget me.

767
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,011
How does it look on me?

768
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,047
Let's see...

769
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,687
Come on.

770
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,047
There he is.

771
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,685
There's an employee missing.

772
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,370
She'll be there any second.

773
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,642
What are you doing?
What is that?

774
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,047
I'm vocalizing.

775
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,765
Quit screwing around.

776
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,201
- Have you peed?
- Twice.

777
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,649
- Ready?
- No, no.

778
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,241
Wait until they take off their coats.

779
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,562
The palace called again yesterday.

780
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,966
What did they want?

781
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,050
- To know when we're sending the jewels.
- What did you say?

782
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,369
That the insurance was taking a while,
like you said.

783
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,611
- I think she's coming today.
- Who?

784
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,322
- Dona Carmen.
- Why?

785
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,923
I saw a military car.

786
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,963
- Where?
- Outside.

787
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,207
Outside?

788
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,290
My God...

789
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,811
Who changed the jewels?

790
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,491
I did, last night.

791
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,523
- The new display was new.
- Yes, but...

792
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,289
- The)I re inferior quality.
- Let's try and move some product.

793
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,925
Is something wrong?

794
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,001
Calm down.
Everybody calm down.

795
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,009
Working, like always.

796
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,687
Dolores.

797
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:10,767
Yes?

798
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,610
- Prepare the orders.
- Yes.

799
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,561
Let's see.

800
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,208
Wait, wait.

801
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,202
Are you okay?

802
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,687
Yeah.

803
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,327
Yeah.

804
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,811
It always happens to me
on opening night.

805
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,485
You're not turning off the car?

806
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,806
- No.
- What if it gets stolen?

807
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,490
Who'd steal a military car?

808
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,205
- Merello.
- What?

809
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,410
Have you ever been in love?

810
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,449
In love? Cut the crap.
What are you talking about?

811
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,210
Not even with the Madam?

812
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,680
With Evita?

813
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,651
You don't fall in love a goddess.
You worship her.

814
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,125
Let's go. Remember the accent.

815
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,365
Good morning.

816
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,605
Can I help you?

817
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,880
Freeze!
This is a robbery...

818
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,601
bollocks.

819
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,124
Nobody move. Don't make me
do something I'll regret.

820
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,289
Where's the safe?

821
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:49,922
Where?

822
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,611
In my office.

823
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,689
Lieutenant, go with him.

824
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:57,803
And you, move.

825
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,282
Move!

826
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,367
Bollocks.

827
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,129
Why are you dressed like that?
Are you crazy?

828
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,845
- Open the safe.
- And your disguises?

829
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,530
Open the safe!

830
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,247
- Open that one.
- Yes.

831
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,283
- Open it!
- Okay, take it easy.

832
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,087
Where is it?

833
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,401
Where is what?

834
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,927
The clover.

835
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,691
- What clover?
- The clover with the chain.

836
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,881
- Yes.
- Where is it?

837
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,845
They changed everything.
I don't know.

838
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,928
Where is it, bollocks?

839
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,004
I'll look for it.

840
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,928
They better not be fake.
Don't dog me.

841
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,963
- Dog you?
- Are they Evita's?

842
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,650
Of course they are!

843
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:02,169
I said a clover! A clover!
Not a ring.

844
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,647
A clover on a chain, it must be...

845
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,961
What are you doing?
Find the clover, bollocks!

846
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,482
Wait, wait!

847
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,647
Wait.

848
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:18,001
Hide them in the wood basket.
All of them.

849
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,891
Wait, hold on.

850
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,761
You can't just leave.
You have to break something.

851
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,247
Make it look like I fought back.

852
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,687
Lieutenant.

853
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,726
Keep looking for the clover.
Lieutenant, what happened?

854
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,207
Keep looking for the clover, bollocks!

855
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,327
I got them, let's go.

856
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,045
- Hurry up!
- I'm coming.

857
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,730
- Come on, damn it!
dust a sec...

858
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,365
What the hell are you looking for?

859
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,246
- Let's go!
- Okay, just a sec...

860
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:46,688
Here it is.

861
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,122
Hold on.

862
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,363
Let's go!

863
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,600
Drive, damn it!

864
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,609
- Drive!
- Okay, okay!

865
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,165
Don't honk the horn, pinhead.

866
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,806
Where's the other car?
You're losing a lot of blood.

867
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,765
- I'm okay.
- You don't look it. Where is it?

868
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,725
Five minutes up this road.
Go get it.

869
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:53,842
I'm not leaving you!

870
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,486
Go get it! I said I'm fine!

871
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,887
Move.

872
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,364
Move, you damn animals!

873
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,803
- I can't believe it. Where's Antunez?
- He took the weekend off.

874
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,809
- Is Gorina still on leave?
- Yeah.

875
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,641
A robbery on a Saturday...
Who am I supposed to send?

876
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,683
I can handle it.

877
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,042
You graduated last month, Ramos.

878
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,686
Second in my class.

879
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,723
- With Naranjo.
- Chief...

880
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,408
He's handled similar cases.

881
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,409
Twenty years ago.

882
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,681
Naranjo!

883
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:57,962
Yes?

884
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,845
I'm assigning you a case.
You hear about the robbery

885
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,724
- downtown?
- Nobody steals in Spain.

886
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,681
Don't get on my tits, Naranjo.

887
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,962
Son of a bitch!

888
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,925
I'll be okay tomorrow.

889
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,610
You need a hospital, Merello.

890
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,325
Not with a gunshot wound.

891
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,285
- What if it gets infected?
- Can you take out the bullet?

892
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,241
Boil some water.
Boil some water.

893
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:52,085
- How many were there?
- Two, there were two.

894
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,770
Military.

895
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,085
- What do you mean, military?
- They had uniforms.

896
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,647
The young one called the other one
lieutenant.

897
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,130
What branch of the army?

898
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,287
I don't know.

899
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,604
- They looked like pilots.
- No, the boots were cavalry.

900
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,003
What did they look like?
Age, physical appearance, height?

901
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,202
- The young one...
- They talked funny.

902
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,287
Yeah.

903
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,561
Funny?

904
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,242
- In Spanish?
- Yeah, but with an accent.

905
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,807
What kind of accent?
Andalusian, Basque, Catalonian...

906
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,571
- No, it was like...
- South American.

907
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,929
Especially the older one
when he came out of the office.

908
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,209
- The young one said "bollocks" a lot.
- Dolores.

909
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,002
- And he wanted a clover on a chain.
- Yes, he went crazy over it.

910
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,800
Crazy.

911
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,006
- And her eyes?
- Like two diamonds.

912
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,443
And sweet.
She was always smiling.

913
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,569
Keep asking.

914
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,761
Yeah, yeah.

915
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,007
Her voice.

916
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,043
What did Evita sound like?

917
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,571
When she spoke,

918
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,367
even if speaking to a crowd,
it was like it was meant for you alone

919
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,403
and it took your breath away...

920
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,090
Okay, Okay...

921
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,123
God, it wasn't that hard.

922
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,090
I'll be okay tomorrow.

923
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,726
- We have to go see Teresa.
- No way.

924
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,651
We'll say you out yourself.
The bullet is out.

925
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,966
You didn't hear me?

926
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,923
We have to close it.
You're not well.

927
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:25,409
I'm not what matters.
All that matters are Evita's jewels.

928
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,490
And that nobody knows where we are.
You got that?

929
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,923
You matter to me.

930
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:34,169
Don't get romantic on me.
Bring me some brandy.

931
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,400
I'll serve you a glass.

932
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,365
Not for me, for the wound.

933
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,809
Pass me the jewels.

934
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:54,881
Well?

935
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,289
Rosario, have you got it?

936
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,608
- Can I try it?
- No, wait.

937
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,283
I don't know, I was upstairs
with the other one.

938
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,130
- The older one?
- Yes.

939
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,482
Did he look familiar to you?

940
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,327
- Almudena.
- What?

941
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,408
He's sore from the robbery...

942
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,966
Sorry.

943
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,810
- Did you talk to him?
- To who?

944
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,240
The one who went up with you.

945
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,408
- He did the talking.
- In Spanish.

946
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,207
Of course, they were Spanish soldiers.

947
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,687
You didn't notice any accent
in particular?

948
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,483
Like what?

949
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,523
South American, perhaps?

950
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,161
No, not South American.
They were definitely Spanish.

951
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,885
- Inspector Ramos?
- Yes.

952
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,889
- The police station calling.
- Thank you.

953
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,048
My assistant will continue.

954
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,522
Why did you go up to the office?

955
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,245
He wanted me to open the safe.

956
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,123
Did you?

957
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,367
No, I refused.

958
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,210
- That's why he hit you?
- Yes.

959
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,811
What do you keep in the safe?

960
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,968
- I didn't open it.
- Exactly.

961
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:58,369
- You must have had a reason not to.
- Well...

962
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,447
What was there?

963
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,083
- In the safe?
- Yes.

964
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:02,849
Nothing.

965
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,607
Nothing?
Then why didn't you open it?

966
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,450
Well, because...

967
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,845
Does it hurt, Antonio?

968
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,640
You see?
All these questions...

969
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,764
Can't you leave it for tomorrow
or the next day? Look at him.

970
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,929
They found the car.

971
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:21,846
How nice!

972
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,487
Would you like some juice?
Freshly-made.

973
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,088
Find the shepherd,
maybe he saw something.

974
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,521
Broken front windshield,

975
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,803
superficial wound...

976
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,451
There isn't much blood.

977
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,683
Because the bullet
is still inside him.

978
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,248
If it had gone out his back,
he'd have left a stain.

979
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,649
Check all the hospitals.

980
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,524
They've been contacted.

981
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,210
The car is stolen.

982
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,087
The other car has this one's plates.

983
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,810
What other car?

984
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,800
If they left the car here,
they had another one waiting.

985
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,481
Inspector.

986
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,805
You saw the other car?

987
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:20,887
No.

988
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,526
- Then who did?
- The girl.

989
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:32,281
I didn't mean to shoot him.
Really

990
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,926
Don't worry, ma'am.
Here.

991
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,171
Don't worry?
I think I killed him.

992
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,249
He shouldn't have robbed us.

993
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:45,808
Sometimes people steal out of need,
Dolores.

994
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:49,323
People need bread or ham,

995
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,601
not jewels

996
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,325
If you'll excuse me...

997
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:53,442
Can we go?

998
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,522
Yes. We'll call you if we need you.

999
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,325
He won't die, will he?

1000
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,602
No. Bad guys never die.

1001
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,531
Nobody dies from getting shot
in the shoulder.

1002
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,529
I hope it doesn't get infected.

1003
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:09,083
- Naranjo, are you ever serious?
- Something wrong?

1004
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,406
I'll be away until Monday.
Keep it out of the press.

1005
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,409
The less you bother Ferran,
the better.

1006
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:19,605
He knows people and I don't want
officials to start calling me.

1007
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:23,442
If you solve the case by Monday,
I'll tell the undersecretary about you.

1008
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,246
- He might lift your sanction.
- I don't have any sanction.

1009
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,965
You know what I mean.

1010
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,402
It's your first robbery, Ramos.
Don't let me down.

1011
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,840
No, I won't.

1012
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,246
- What about the uniforms?
- Firemen.

1013
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,283
- What?
- Yeah, formal attire.

1014
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,164
You're kidding me.

1015
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,203
A young guy rented them.

1016
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,766
- Spanish?
- No, South American.

1017
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,567
All right.

1018
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,366
We've got...

1019
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:54,847
two South Americans rob
a jeweler's in downtown Madrid

1020
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:59,329
dressed as firemen and steal junk
and a silver clover.

1021
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,045
Does it make any sense to you?

1022
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,607
Hit him. Hit him!
That's it, hit him!

1023
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,609
Dodge him, dodge him.

1024
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,805
That's it, good.

1025
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,240
Come on, come on.

1026
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:19,965
Raise your guard, damn it!

1027
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,447
Go on, play with him, play with him.

1028
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,642
Now hit him. Hit him low!

1029
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,883
How are things, Julian?

1030
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,645
- The boys okay?
- Not as good as you.

1031
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,849
Stay with them. Come on.

1032
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:43,202
No, damn it!
Straight to the face.

1033
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:47,246
Look, watch me.
Right, left, right, left, right, left.

1034
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:49,808
Got it?

1035
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,525
- Teodoro.
- What?

1036
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:52,562
Look who's here.

1037
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,367
Hi, Dad.

1038
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,727
Well? Have you been to Mass already?

1039
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,163
- Today's Saturday, Teodoro.
- He goes every day.

1040
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,407
Why are you here?

1041
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,085
To talk to you.

1042
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,164
Can't you see I'm busy?

1043
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,565
What do you want?

1044
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,131
Who sells guns like this one?

1045
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,530
- You're the policeman.
- Who sells them in Madrid?

1046
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,404
I'm not in that business any more.

1047
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,527
It's an Walther P 38.

1048
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:28,445
You think I'm blind?

1049
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,805
Where could it have come from?

1050
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,241
Those came here
with the Blue Division.

1051
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:34,646
Who ended up with them?

1052
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,646
Just because I went straight
doesn't mean I'll tell you for free.

1053
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:43,807
How much?

1054
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,482
Stop it, damn it!

1055
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,485
Mug$y...

1056
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,483
"Mugsy" sells them.

1057
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,368
You had to go and be a cop...

1058
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,369
just like that bastard.

1059
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:26,921
Wait.

1060
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,848
How do you know my father?

1061
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,728
I arrested him a couple times.

1062
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,083
He was a tough bloke.

1063
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,571
What happened to him?

1064
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,966
He cheated the Portuguese
and you can see where it got him.

1065
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,569
No wonder he's bitter, huh?

1066
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,001
Even worse, his son became a cop.

1067
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,567
There's a black sheep
in every family.

1068
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,444
Does anyone else on the force know?

1069
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,489
No. I'm the only one.

1070
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:01,403
Let's keep it that way.

1071
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,851
I don't know.
We don't sell arms here.

1072
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,202
Right. But maybe you can help me.

1073
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,925
I don't know anything.

1074
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,929
But you must have seen someone or...

1075
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,407
- I said I don't know anything.
- The police think you do.

1076
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,806
Yeah, all of them.

1077
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,446
And that gun wounded
a police officer today.

1078
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,086
- People are upset.
- No wonder.

1079
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,727
You know how we policemen get
when you don't collaborate.

1080
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,002
You'll have to look elsewhere.

1081
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,528
You don't have to give us names.

1082
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,689
Nobody gives us their names.

1083
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:47,362
Okay. But what if a foreigner came in
wanting to buy it.

1084
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,289
South American, for example.

1085
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,686
Where would he be from?

1086
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,120
Argentina.

1087
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,130
The son of a bitch was Argentinean.

1088
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:06,962
Everybody listen up, please.
Each of you pick a table

1089
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,762
and gather all the visas given
to South Americans arriving in Spain

1090
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,361
in the last month and order them
by day of arrival.

1091
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,528
Understood?
Right, get to work.

1092
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,601
Good morning.

1093
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,928
- Good morning. They're here.
- I can see that.

1094
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,006
What are you doing?

1095
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,487
Ordering them by arrival date.
Can you give me a hand?

1096
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,251
No, not by date.
We only need Argentineans.

1097
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,408
What if the)I re Chilean or Mexican?

1098
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:37,647
You heard the dealer.

1099
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,921
Right.

1100
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,883
- Have you had breakfast?
- No.

1101
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,242
You shouldn't work
on an empty stomach.

1102
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,087
Today's Sunday.

1103
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,611
- So?
- I have Mass.

1104
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:52,931
- So you skip breakfast?
- To take Communion.

1105
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,890
Can you help me out?

1106
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,491
I don't like priests.

1107
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,005
I'm going to have breakfast.

1108
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,362
Okay, boys.

1109
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,131
Focus on the Argentineans.
They're Argentinean.

1110
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,407
No.

1111
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,322
No.

1112
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:18,927
No.

1113
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:21,842
No.

1114
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:24,928
No.

1115
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:27,164
Wait. Can I see this one?

1116
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,763
Moises Landa.

1117
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,005
His face...

1118
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,251
Moises Landa?

1119
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,169
You said the robbers were...

1120
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,247
Wait.

1121
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,684
No. He's not a bank robber.

1122
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,245
He was...

1123
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,407
A what?

1124
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:49,449
- A client. He came to see Mr. Ferran.
- What for?

1125
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:50,846
I don't know.

1126
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,401
When was that?

1127
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,721
Well...

1128
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:59,728
Of course, it was a few days before
dona Carmen came in...

1129
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:00,682
Dona Carmen?

1130
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,047
Dona Carmen.

1131
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,765
Carmen Polo, Franco's wife.

1132
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:04,768
Yes.

1133
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,603
Moises Landa.
What else do you remember?

1134
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,523
He had an asthma attack.
If it weren't for the nurse...

1135
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:16,767
What nurse?

1136
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:19,801
- The girl who treated him.
- What do you want?

1137
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,281
You have a visitor.

1138
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,164
- From the insurance company?
- Insurance?

1139
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,210
This will only take a second.

1140
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:32,365
Right, the nurse.
What else can you tell me about her?

1141
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,802
She said she worked at the Concepcion.

1142
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,411
- The clinic?
- Yes.

1143
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,324
- Good morning.
- Hello, good morning.

1144
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,126
- Something to drink?
- No, I have people waiting.

1145
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,800
Here's the list of what was taken
from the jeweler's.

1146
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,082
Great, thank you very much.

1147
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,128
- What's the total amount?
- 35,817 pesetas.

1148
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,607
And the clover?
A clover on a chain.

1149
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,802
The clover? The clover...

1150
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,570
500 pesetas.

1151
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,370
Not very much, is it?

1152
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:02,291
For a robbery at a jeweler's
like this one?

1153
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,970
It's nothing.

1154
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,447
- Anything else?
- No, no. That's it.

1155
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,603
Well, yes. One moment.

1156
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,926
- Can Ferran be trusted?
- What do you mean?

1157
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:15,647
Of course. Ferran's a serious jeweler.
Why do you ask?

1158
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,365
No, because...

1159
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:20,609
a few days before the robbery...

1160
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,281
Franco's wife visited the jeweler's.

1161
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:24,686
- Dona Carmen?
- Yes.

1162
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,848
- What did she take?
- I don't know, actually.

1163
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,565
That woman is always after something.

1164
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,922
You asked if Ferran could be trusted.

1165
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,691
He's the one who proposed
creating a fund.

1166
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,041
What fund?

1167
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,846
Franco's wife often takes jewels
without paying,

1168
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,883
so Madrid's biggest jewelers

1169
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,208
created a fund to reimburse
each other.

1170
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,801
And it was Ferran's idea.

1171
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,725
Anything else?

1172
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,651
No, thank you.
I'll see you out.

1173
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:07,246
Miguel?

1174
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,286
Miguel?

1175
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,122
Let's see.

1176
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,609
- It looks beautiful on you.
- Does it?

1177
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,965
I really like it.

1178
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,170
Yeah, I wanted...

1179
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,600
I wanted to give it to you
before I leave.

1180
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,127
You're leaving?

1181
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,529
Yeah, tonight with my uncle

1182
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:45,767
and...

1183
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,571
the thing is...

1184
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,085
Forget it.

1185
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:52,123
No. What's wrong?

1186
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,289
My uncle hurt himself, out himself,
there's a little hole and...

1187
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:02,291
I don't know if he'll be able
to travel.

1188
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,289
You should bring him here
to see a doctor.

1189
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,447
Yeah, but...

1190
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,881
he doesn't like these places.

1191
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:11,482
I don't know where he'll go.
It's a Uruguayan thing.

1192
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,367
Well, then?

1193
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,723
Well, I was thinking...

1194
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:19,487
that...

1195
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,247
maybe if you came to us,

1196
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,760
you could treat him and we'd get
a little extra time together.

1197
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,963
I can't leave work.

1198
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,165
What time do you get off?

1199
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,564
Policemen, huh?

1200
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:57,650
You don't know very much
for policemen.

1201
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:58,648
Right.

1202
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:00,922
- He was treated here?
- Yes.

1203
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,441
That's strange.
This is a maternity ward.

1204
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:04,766
We know that.

1205
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,691
- What day was it?
- The 4th or 5th, in the morning.

1206
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,367
Let's see.

1207
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:17,527
Well.

1208
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,929
- Landa, Moises.
- That's right.

1209
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,770
Breathing trouble, yes.

1210
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:22,882
Any address?

1211
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,605
- No.
- Who treated him?

1212
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,680
Doctor Sebastian,
but he's off on Sundays.

1213
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,769
- Will he be in tomorrow?
- Afternoon.

1214
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:32,049
Great, thanks. Very kind of you.

1215
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,890
- Thank you.
- Wait. Teresa!

1216
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,087
What is it?

1217
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,805
You treated the guy with asthma?

1218
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,122
Yes.

1219
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,482
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

1220
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:45,325
I'd never met a Moises before.
Did something happen to him?

1221
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:47,648
- Well, you see...
- He lost some papers.

1222
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:52,084
Someone turned them in and we thought
you might have his address in Madrid.

1223
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,281
How do you know he was here?

1224
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:55,323
The police know a lot of things.

1225
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,966
The taxi driver who brought him here
found the papers.

1226
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:58,888
Right.

1227
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,245
Do you know where we can find him?

1228
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,008
No. He went back to his country
that evening.

1229
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,931
- To Argentina.
- He said he lived in Panama.

1230
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,923
Do you know his address there?

1231
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:11,008
No.

1232
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,440
Or his hotel in Madrid?

1233
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,450
- Or what he was doing here?
- No.

1234
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,244
You haven't heard from him since?

1235
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,524
He sent me a record.

1236
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,610
How nice of him.

1237
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,121
- Yes.
- Did it have a return address?

1238
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,648
No. Someone brought it.

1239
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:28,807
A mutual friend?

1240
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,246
His son.

1241
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,005
Landa's son?

1242
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:37,127
Yes.

1243
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,650
Do you know where we can find him?

1244
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:43,167
No.

1245
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,002
He brought it and left right away.

1246
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,611
He hasn't called you...?

1247
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,561
No, no.

1248
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:53,445
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go back to work.

1249
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,449
Dust a couple more questions.
- It's okay, Naranjo.

1250
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,768
She's busy, can't you see?

1251
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:01,808
Thanks for your time. If you see him,
tell him to contact us

1252
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,047
about the papers.

1253
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:06,528
I probably won't see him again.
If you don't mind...

1254
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:07,607
Yes.

1255
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,691
- Did you see it?
- Sure, he likes the girl.

1256
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,689
- The clover.
- What clover?

1257
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:17,689
The silver clover.

1258
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:20,042
Bloody hell, Naranjo.
Damn it.

1259
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,326
Where were you?

1260
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,687
The clinic.

1261
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,209
You're an idiot.

1262
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,242
Nobody saw me.

1263
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,205
Teresa's going to treat you.

1264
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,880
I'm bringing her
when she gets off work.

1265
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,761
And the police will follow you here.

1266
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,644
If they haven't already.

1267
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,161
Let's go.

1268
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:11,725
Where?

1269
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:15,204
To the clinic.
They can't find us here.

1270
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,289
Promise me something, Miguel.

1271
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:21,166
If something happens,
never say you were at this house.

1272
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,605
What can happen?

1273
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,570
Promise me.

1274
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,001
I promise.

1275
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,882
- Get Ferran's jewels and let's go.
- What about Evita's?

1276
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,605
Ferran's.

1277
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,364
Watch the corner with Berruguete.
You, over there.

1278
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,569
Let me know if you see anything.

1279
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,682
They'll be waiting around the corner

1280
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:53,405
- How many men?
- Two cars.

1281
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,522
Good.

1282
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,609
When the nurse comes out, right?

1283
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,043
- I'll call them and they'll follow us
- If the robbers don't show up first

1284
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,480
Then we'll go to plan B.

1285
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:02,761
- Want some?
- No.

1286
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,644
- Go ahead.
- No, thank you.

1287
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,126
You're going to miss Mass.

1288
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,085
- At 8 at the Trinitarian.
- Sure.

1289
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,845
She's coming out.

1290
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,731
I'll call the cars.

1291
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:17,322
Damn it, hurry up, Ramos.

1292
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,090
How does this thing work?

1293
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:23,489
Naranjo. It's a man, not a nurse.

1294
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,730
You're kidding.

1295
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,241
You can't see anything
in this light.

1296
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:33,171
There was plenty inside
and you didn't see the clover.

1297
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,369
You can't see a damn thing, can you?

1298
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,290
Very clever.

1299
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,049
What will you do on Monday?

1300
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:43,447
- And you?
- Your medical exam.

1301
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:48,291
If nobody squeals,
I'll pass it like every year.

1302
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,931
- You can't see anything?
- Sure I can.

1303
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,805
But not much.

1304
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:58,963
The problem is it's glaucoma
and it's getting worse.

1305
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,129
A policeman who can't see
is dangerous.

1306
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:04,524
Especially one who spends
all day typing.

1307
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,890
Today you're not typing.

1308
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,047
Wait.

1309
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,165
There's a car coming.

1310
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,129
Why don't you retire?

1311
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,727
If I retire now,
they'll pay me a pittance

1312
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:23,526
and I won't be able to take care of
my wife and son.

1313
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:26,929
She can go to hell,
but I want him to study like you.

1314
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,929
But not to be a cop.

1315
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,970
You don't like being a cop?

1316
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,969
It's my life, of course I do.

1317
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:36,606
What I don't like is...
Hold on a second.

1318
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:38,766
Who's getting out?

1319
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,566
A young man.

1320
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,649
What don't you like?

1321
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,683
The other one's getting out.

1322
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,041
Yes, but...

1323
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:47,527
Wait.

1324
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,006
- An older guy?
- Yes.

1325
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,688
- Is he injured?
- I don't know.

1326
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,245
You're the one who can see,
damn it!

1327
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,647
- How's he wearing his coat?
- Well...

1328
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:58,605
- Hanging over his shoulders?
- That's right.

1329
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,241
Make the call.
You can forget Mass, Ramos.

1330
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,601
This is Ramos. Plan B.

1331
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,286
There's no one here.

1332
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,842
Don't tell them where the house is.

1333
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,246
Don't tell who?

1334
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,445
Them.

1335
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,525
Bank robbers arrested...

1336
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,848
Uruguayan bank robbers
to stand trial...

1337
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,849
Nurse suspected accomplice...

1338
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:52,849
Police catch robbers in 48 hours...

1339
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,610
All jewels recovered.

1340
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,041
Young inspector Benito Ramos amazes

1341
01:22:57,240 --> 01:23:00,130
by arresting bank robbers
in record time.

1342
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:03,324
Stop thinking about it.
The case is closed.

1343
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,251
- And well done, by the way.
- There are still loose ends.

1344
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,841
Are there? Like what?

1345
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:11,846
Ferran hid his dealings with Landa
from us.

1346
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:13,804
Leave Ferran out of this.

1347
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,561
Yes, but Landa was the link
between the robbers and the nurse.

1348
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,001
The case is closed, Ramos.

1349
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,085
And Landa works in Panama

1350
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,611
at Peron's office.

1351
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:25,488
SQ?

1352
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:28,684
Evita liked jewelry
and Peron needs money.

1353
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,048
You didn't hear me?
Forget it.

1354
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,969
The robbery took place

1355
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,561
only days after Franco's wife
visited the jeweler's.

1356
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,171
If I say the case is closed,

1357
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,408
the case is closed. And Ramos,

1358
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,171
watch yourself.
Your promotion is still unsigned

1359
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,490
Naranjo, have a seat.

1360
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,289
What did you tell that kid?

1361
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:56,922
You want him to end up like you?

1362
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:00,329
It doesn't add up, Verdu.
And you know it.

1363
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:02,682
I know a lot of things, Naranjo.

1364
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,645
And one of them is not to touch this.

1365
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:13,248
I hear the head of security job
is vacant at our embassy in Havana.

1366
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:16,200
A well-paid job, quiet place,

1367
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,209
nice climate,
surrounded by mulatto girls

1368
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,408
You forget the robbery,

1369
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,080
I'll put in a word for you
and the job is yours.

1370
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:28,160
It's the chance of a lifetime,
Naranjo.

1371
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:31,530
If you have vision,
you won't let it get away.

1372
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,008
You have one day to think it over.

1373
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,326
Very well.

1374
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,766
I'm sorry we couldn't finish the case.

1375
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,769
That's okay, it doesn't matter.

1376
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:56,243
How did you know the robbery
might be related to Evita's jewels?

1377
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:57,407
And dona Carmen?

1378
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,090
It was a shot in the dark,

1379
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,931
but he confirmed it was a bull's-eye.
You saw him.

1380
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,169
- Damn, Naranjo.
- What?

1381
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:11,087
I don't get it. With your experience,
they have you here,

1382
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,361
doing paperwork...

1383
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,085
Stuff from the war

1384
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:17,327
Were you a Red?

1385
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:18,567
No, no.

1386
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:21,809
I was a cop, but with the other ones,
the ones who lost the war.

1387
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,765
And you know how that gets repaid
in this country.

1388
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,325
Did you get your exam results back?

1389
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:27,967
Well?

1390
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:30,851
Fine. I have a good memory.

1391
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:32,845
And good vision.

1392
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:36,089
And good vision, Naranjo.
They're the ones who are blind.

1393
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:41,647
Ramos!

1394
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:45,764
Are there really
a lot of mulatto girls in Cuba?

1395
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:57,728
You'll pay dearly for this, Landa.

1396
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,930
You'll pay dearly for this.

1397
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,489
The general had better not find out.

1398
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:06,727
Please.

1399
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:09,963
The bank robbers were our people?

1400
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:11,605
- Yes.
- Who are they?

1401
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,486
Merello and another guy
you don't know.

1402
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:16,967
Merello? Are you kidding me?

1403
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,250
He's the injured one?

1404
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:20,646
Who's the other one?

1405
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,968
An Argentinean acquaintance of mine.

1406
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,003
But neither of them will talk.

1407
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,363
Landa, Landa...

1408
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:32,042
You assured me
there wouldn't be any trouble.

1409
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:35,403
- What will happen to the jewels?
- The jewels are safe.

1410
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:37,521
Are you sure?

1411
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:38,607
Yes.

1412
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,091
Landa...

1413
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:06,885
- This too?
- Yes.

1414
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:08,684
Why didn't you tell me
you were leaving?

1415
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,121
Would you have come to Mexico with me?

1416
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:14,008
Does the general know you're leaving?

1417
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,009
The general already has another girl.

1418
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:18,362
That conniving little Isabelita.

1419
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,689
Miguel left me this for you.

1420
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:24,409
- Is he staying in Madrid?
- Yes.

1421
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:25,767
How lucky.

1422
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,087
Madrid.

1423
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:30,049
Madrid, Madrid...

1424
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:42,801
Dear Landa.

1425
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:46,570
This may all seem silly to you,

1426
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:50,401
but when I was little my mother
talked a lot about you.

1427
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:53,683
She talked about when you met...
I don't know...

1428
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:57,885
Things she said to you,
trips you took together...

1429
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:00,526
I always imagined you two together

1430
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:03,610
and began to dream
of having a father like you.

1431
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:06,246
It was foolish of me, I know.

1432
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:09,489
But all that made me feel
a little less alone

1433
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,569
and I swore that some day
I would find you.

1434
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,851
That's why I came to Panama
to meet you.

1435
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:18,010
And when I saw you, I knew you were
my father. My heart told me so.

1436
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:22,247
That's why I'm going to Madrid,
to make you proud of me.

1437
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,727
Although I never doubted you...

1438
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:26,729
How could a son doubt his father?

1439
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:29,651
...But if you're reading this,
it means things didn't go as planned

1440
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:32,571
and it's possible
I'll never see you again.

1441
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:36,651
I hope I made you proud. I send you
the hug I never got to give you.

1442
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:40,567
Long live Peron, long live Evita,
long live Argentina.

1443
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:42,444
Your son, Miguel.

1444
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:00,285
Today's Tuesday.

1445
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,847
What the hell do you care?

1446
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:06,329
It's visiting day.

1447
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,290
He won't come.

1448
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:12,162
He must have read the letter by now.

1449
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:14,601
What if the dancer
didn't give it to him?

1450
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:17,890
Why wouldn't she?

1451
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:18,967
Bermejo.

1452
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,488
- What is it?
- Visitor.

1453
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:26,568
- What about me?
- You'll go after.

1454
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,886
I won't stop until
I get you out of here, Merello.

1455
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:05,369
When? I'm sick of being Uruguayan.

1456
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:07,689
I'll take care of it.

1457
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:10,884
Sooner or later,
you two are coming back to Panama.

1458
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:12,805
How's the general?

1459
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:17,082
He ordered me to keep fighting
until they send you back

1460
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:20,090
and he can give you a hug
personally.

1461
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:24,481
- He didn't forget us?
- He would never forget you, Merello.

1462
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:27,001
He's proud of you.

1463
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,725
And grateful...

1464
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:31,526
that you didn't tell them
where the jewels are.

1465
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:33,370
They're Evita's.

1466
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:37,602
Yes, of course.
Where did you hide them?

1467
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:41,560
The general would like to see them.

1468
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:49,320
Landa, you know I would do anything
for the general.

1469
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:53,760
And you know I'd never keep anything
that wasn't mine.

1470
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:58,041
But until we get out of here...

1471
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,361
I'll do everything in my power
to get you out, Merello.

1472
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:05,445
But those jewels are very important.

1473
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:09,806
To everyone. To the general,
to the movement, to the fatherland.

1474
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,241
They're more important
than our own lives.

1475
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:15,845
Than yours and mine, definitely.

1476
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:19,044
You and I knew what
we were getting into, Landa.

1477
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,289
But not the kid.

1478
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,921
And he took it like a man

1479
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:29,442
and never told them where we hid
the jewels. And they hit him hard.

1480
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:35,486
He's rotting in here.
If you don't get him out quick...

1481
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:37,682
You're going romantic on me, Merello.

1482
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,602
When we get out of here,

1483
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:44,407
I'll tell you where we hid the jewels.
Don't worry.

1484
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:50,921
- You want to see the kid, right?
- Please.

1485
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:53,210
They're for you.

1486
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:16,401
How are you?

1487
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,287
You look like you've lost weight.

1488
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:25,127
Plenty of beans, not much red meat.

1489
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:28,126
Are you sleeping okay?

1490
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:33,445
It's a bit cold.

1491
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,560
I'll send you a couple blankets.

1492
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:42,090
Have you seen Teresa?

1493
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:44,962
No.

1494
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,485
Go and see her.

1495
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:53,646
Tell her we're not angry at her,
that we know she had

1496
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:55,805
nothing to do with it.

1497
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:04,010
And give her this.

1498
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:10,570
I made it in the workshop.

1499
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:20,765
Did Rosita give you a letter?

1500
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:26,362
From me?

1501
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:31,521
Did you read it?

1502
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:39,883
Then you know that...

1503
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:44,805
we're family.

1504
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:05,325
You know the first thing
I'm gonna do when I get out?

1505
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:12,246
Give my daddy the hug
I never got to give him.

1506
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:25,886
I'll get you out of here, son.

1507
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:27,886
I swear.

1508
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:29,764
I'll get you out.

1509
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:46,803
23 years is a long time, Colonel.

1510
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:51,003
Armed robbery.

1511
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,043
Dressed as soldiers.

1512
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,169
It was a court martial.

1513
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:58,611
- They could have got longer.
- Yes, of course.

1514
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:02,806
But there must be some way
to get them out.

1515
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:04,889
A pardon, perhaps.

1516
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:08,001
They've been in prison
for less than two months.

1517
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:09,850
There must be something.

1518
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:11,883
This is a serious country, Landa.

1519
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,368
Yes, I'm not questioning that.

1520
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:22,282
What worries me is to what extent
your men can be trusted.

1521
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:24,562
Absolutely, Colonel.

1522
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:28,560
But being away from home for so long,
in a foreign country...

1523
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:32,525
Knowing if they talk
they could implicate Franco's wife...

1524
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:33,562
Landa...

1525
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:36,809
They were only doing their duty
as patriots,

1526
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,001
Colonel.

1527
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:41,283
I can't get them out of prison
just like that.

1528
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:43,323
But we'll see what we can do.

1529
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:44,927
Give me...

1530
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,842
Give me a couple months.

1531
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:52,765
And make sure
they keep their mouths shut.

1532
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:26,485
Come on, let's go.

1533
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:55,608
Let's go!

1534
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:02,441
Come on.

1535
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:14,045
Where are we?

1536
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:17,487
Cross the grove.

1537
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:21,526
The)I re waiting by the river.
Right. Goodbye.

1538
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:23,967
Hey...

1539
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,041
I told you they'd get us out!

1540
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:58,445
There they are.

1541
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:04,169
BANK ROBBERS SHOT TO DEATH

1542
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:08,684
FUGITIVES SHOT BY POLICE
AFTER RESISTING ARREST

1543
01:40:09,305 --> 01:40:15,325
