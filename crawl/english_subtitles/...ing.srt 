Screenplay by Jin Kim

10
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:07,409
A film by Eonhee Lee

11
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:51,285
Why do you get so excited
every time you see the ballet?

12
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,598
Isn't it wonderful?

13
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,767
Just once I would like to see
one in person.

14
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:00,203
I wonder if this troupe will
come to Korea?

15
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,773
Would you like to go see it
over there?

16
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,274
- Really?
- Really!

17
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,715
- We're going to Europe, then?
- Yes.

18
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:11,750
And we'll really get to see
the ballet, too?

19
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,442
We'll watch the ballet
until we're sick of it!

20
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,286
- But what about your restaurant?
- I sold it.

21
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,155
- Why?
- To go to Europe.

22
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,657
Really?

23
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:24,251
No! Lies, lies!

24
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,524
It's all lies!

25
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,292
What a liar!

26
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,008
Want me to prepare
a bath for you?

27
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,577
Sounds great.

28
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,009
- Did you bring your medicine?
- Yes, I've got it here.

29
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,876
Did someone move in?

30
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,577
Get in the house.
I'm going.

31
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,188
Didn't you forget something?

32
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,293
- You're insatiable!
- That's an expression of affection.

33
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,992
Why don't you
get a boyfriend?

34
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,605
What a hopeless class this is!

35
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,715
Teacher, please.
Help us wake up.

36
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,374
You come on up here!

37
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,482
I'll wake you up with
a slap to the head!

38
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,985
Teacher, please tell us about
your first love!

39
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,387
Haven't you loved someone
like the crossing guard did?

40
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:05,732
Oh, you poor girls, do you
really believe that story?

41
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:09,498
Stop talking and
write this down.

42
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,556
(A 100-day anniversary ring!)

43
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,198
How are you doing in class?

44
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,596
Alright.

45
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,762
Because you came in the
middle of the semester ...

46
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,066
... it will be harder to make friends,
but they'll come around.

47
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,674
I wouldn't worry about it.

48
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,367
So this is Mina?

49
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,050
If you're feeling uncomfortable ...

50
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,345
... don't hesitate to come to me ...

51
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,454
... and if you have any questions at
all, don't be afraid to ask.

52
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,917
Now, go!

53
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,263
Well ...

54
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,265
... I do have one question.

55
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:19,766
You mean about Kisu,
the crossing guard?

56
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,875
Oh, Kisu?
The man with the flags ...

57
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,671
... in front of the school?

58
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,781
When he was in high school ...

59
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,042
... he liked a girl in our school ...

60
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,549
... and one rainy day ...

61
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:35,347
...when Kisu
was waiting for her ...

62
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:40,050
... she was struck by a car while
crossing the street and was killed.

63
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,355
Since then, he has stood in front
of our school, directing traffic.

64
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,363
When it rains, he bursts
into tears.

65
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,764
Isn't that just a story
that students tell?

66
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,564
I suppose so.

67
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,255
- Excuse me.  White wine, please.
- Yes, just a moment.

68
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,166
Jukja asked a fortuneteller ...

69
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,964
... if she would find a boyfriend
before she died ...

70
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,163
The oracle said ...

71
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,866
... she would find
a boyfriend that winter.

72
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,968
So Jinju asked
the same question ...

73
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,080
... and the fortuneteller said ...

74
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:38,650
"Why don't you just
watch soap operas instead?"

75
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,650
Being in love
is a nice thing, isn't it?

76
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:46,952
You don't get hungry or cold
even when you don't eat in winter.

77
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:50,961
You're absolutely right.  We had
those days too, didn't we?

78
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,570
- Misuk.
- What?

79
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,269
You know about Mina.

80
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,180
Don't say anything
if it's about Mina.

81
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,046
I think about it enough as it is.

82
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:17,553
But still, why isn't she
in the hospital?

83
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,453
There's no cure for her.

84
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,958
So, why stay
in the hospital?

85
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,358
But there could be
a miracle.

86
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,556
Miracle? Yes, there could be ...

87
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,167
... but I think it's already a miracle
that Mina has lived until now.

88
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:39,472
Mina has been in and out of the
hospital since she was born ...

89
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,639
... with operations and injections ...

90
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,752
... all over her body.

91
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,954
Now they say
there's no more hope.

92
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,149
I can't make her
suffer more ...

93
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,351
for her few last months.

94
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,860
You sure you won't regret it
after Mina's gone?

95
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:09,469
I will drink ... cry ...

96
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,876
... and call you.

97
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,944
Don't tell me!
Are you watching that again?

98
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,953
It's so embarrassing!

99
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,147
What?

100
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,349
Naked guys dancing like that ...

101
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:30,155
I don't know where to look!

102
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,262
Just don't look down there!

103
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,664
How? It's impossible not to look.

104
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,568
Protruding ... and so noticeable!

105
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:44,073
I'm still a woman, you know.

106
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,039
I'm leaving now.

107
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,645
Lock the door!

108
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:42,892
I'm sorry, did that hurt?
I'll get you some medicine.

109
00:12:29,787 --> 00:12:31,755
Can I get a cigarette?

110
00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:33,747
Cigarette!

111
00:12:35,392 --> 00:12:38,452
Take off your headphones ...

112
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:40,563
... and look at me!

113
00:12:45,736 --> 00:12:48,204
Will you give me a cigarette?

114
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:51,970
I'll pay you double.

115
00:13:05,255 --> 00:13:07,416
I just moved in downstairs.

116
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,228
Shouldn't you say, "Nice to meet
you", or something like that?

117
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,059
I need a light, too!

118
00:13:23,507 --> 00:13:25,065
No lighter?

119
00:13:27,411 --> 00:13:29,572
I'll return it as soon as I use it.

120
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:46,353
Interesting.
Isn't that a Navy insignia?

121
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,988
- Throw it to me!
- Next time.

122
00:14:09,887 --> 00:14:11,149
Hello!

123
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:13,049
Hello.

124
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,851
I'm your new
neighbor downstairs.

125
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:16,653
Nice to meet you.

126
00:14:16,793 --> 00:14:17,953
Oh, I see.

127
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:21,360
About yesterday, thank you.
I'll give it back to you soon.

128
00:14:25,102 --> 00:14:28,469
- You lent him something?
- Uh, yeah.

129
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:30,072
He's good-looking.

130
00:14:30,207 --> 00:14:32,072
You weren't looking
at his face, I guess.

131
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:34,677
Come on, he's
exactly your type.

132
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:36,779
If you like him that much,
you can have him.

133
00:14:36,914 --> 00:14:40,145
Ah, don't BS me!

134
00:14:53,397 --> 00:14:55,558
Oh, there's a present for
you in the back seat.

135
00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:56,961
A present?

136
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:10,079
- A cellphone?
- Don't you like it?

137
00:15:26,697 --> 00:15:28,164
Hello.

138
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,362
What?

139
00:15:33,603 --> 00:15:36,163
Since this is your first time
I'll give you a break ...

140
00:15:36,306 --> 00:15:39,070
... but if you call me for no reason
I'll stop carrying this phone.

141
00:15:45,582 --> 00:15:47,447
The total is W29,000 ($28).

142
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:51,650
Isn't it a bit warm for
a mitten?

143
00:15:51,788 --> 00:15:54,450
Don't you have
a bag with handles?

144
00:15:59,196 --> 00:16:02,359
Hey, troublemaker!

145
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,469
You look like an
exemplary student, though.

146
00:16:06,603 --> 00:16:09,572
Sneaking a smoke behind
your mother's back?

147
00:16:09,906 --> 00:16:11,771
Give me back my lighter!

148
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:15,371
Why?  Planning some more
undercover smoking?

149
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:17,473
Why are you picking on me?

150
00:16:17,614 --> 00:16:21,550
That's what guys do when they
find a girl they like.

151
00:16:21,685 --> 00:16:23,846
You know what, I studied
psychology a little.

152
00:16:23,987 --> 00:16:29,254
Human beings have a tendency
to solve problems unconsciously.

153
00:16:29,393 --> 00:16:32,556
If someone makes you feel bad ...

154
00:16:32,696 --> 00:16:35,358
... you keep thinking about them.

155
00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:38,567
Like how school boys pull ...

156
00:16:38,702 --> 00:16:41,967
... on the skirts of girls they like.

157
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:45,069
Those little kids
know that instinctively.

158
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,766
It's all in psychology books.

159
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:51,078
Wasn't that on TV?
I saw that program, too.

160
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:54,240
Huh? It was on TV, too?

161
00:16:55,385 --> 00:17:00,254
Oh, I forgot your
lighter again.

162
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,450
Take this, instead of the cigarette
that I borrowed yesterday.

163
00:17:04,294 --> 00:17:06,262
No I want my lighter back!

164
00:17:06,396 --> 00:17:11,857
Hey, don't be such a grump!
This isn't just candy, it's my heart.

165
00:17:28,885 --> 00:17:31,854
Hello, my princess!
Did you have fun today?

166
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,650
"Princess" ... do you think I'm a baby?

167
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:40,661
Of course, dropping things all over.
Are you missing something?

168
00:17:41,698 --> 00:17:45,156
Someone found it
and gave it to the janitor.

169
00:17:46,603 --> 00:17:49,163
Keep it safe!
It's expensive.

170
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:52,764
Save my number and my restaurant
number in it.

171
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,374
It will store up to
1,000 phone numbers.

172
00:17:56,513 --> 00:17:59,539
I don't even know 10 numbers.

173
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:10,651
Well, aren't you going to answer it?

174
00:18:13,597 --> 00:18:16,566
- Hello.
- Hi, trouble- maker!

175
00:18:18,702 --> 00:18:20,363
Wrong number.

176
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,677
Don't hang up!
I'm really sorry about today.

177
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:31,781
Give me a chance to apologize.

178
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:33,850
What number did you dial?

179
00:18:33,984 --> 00:18:35,849
Ah, is your mother there?

180
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:38,250
- You got the wrong number.
- Wait, hold on!

181
00:18:38,388 --> 00:18:42,654
Open your window in an hour.
It's important, please!

182
00:18:47,397 --> 00:18:52,164
Wow, this phone is pretty cool!
It's a camera, too.

183
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:56,169
Mina... don't you want to
fall in love?

184
00:18:56,306 --> 00:18:58,274
Misuk, wake up.

185
00:18:58,408 --> 00:19:01,468
Okay, here is a picture of
a crazy woman.

186
00:19:01,611 --> 00:19:03,476
When I was your age, that's
all I could think about.

187
00:19:03,613 --> 00:19:08,641
Where I could find a sexy guy?
Where I could find my love?

188
00:19:11,288 --> 00:19:12,949
So was it successful?

189
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:15,250
Of course!  My romantic life
was really prospering back then.

190
00:19:15,392 --> 00:19:18,759
My dating life was always
packed and crowded.

191
00:19:18,895 --> 00:19:20,157
It was awesome.

192
00:19:20,297 --> 00:19:22,356
That's your problem, Misuk ...

193
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:24,467
... confusing love and business.

194
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:27,866
And you want to get back
just as much as you give.

195
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:29,767
Real love's not like that.

196
00:19:29,906 --> 00:19:33,569
It's just being happy without
expecting anything in return.

197
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,770
You read too many of those
romance comic books.

198
00:19:36,913 --> 00:19:40,349
In my opinion,
Love is like this...

199
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:44,249
Someone you love gets hit by a
car and killed one rainy day.

200
00:19:44,387 --> 00:19:46,651
After that, you can't leave
the accident site.

201
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,157
You go there to direct traffic,
thinking about your love.

202
00:19:50,293 --> 00:19:53,558
Never missing a single day,
crying when it's raining ...

203
00:19:53,697 --> 00:19:56,860
What morose
comic books you read!

204
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,764
Anyway, I will definitely find
the man of my destiny ...

205
00:19:59,903 --> 00:20:02,269
... and fall madly in love
with him.

206
00:20:02,405 --> 00:20:05,374
When I finally introduce him to
you, please be opposed to him ...

207
00:20:05,508 --> 00:20:08,068
- ... even if you like him.
- Why?

208
00:20:08,211 --> 00:20:09,974
Because it'd be cool.

209
00:20:10,914 --> 00:20:14,645
I will have an immortal love
that overcomes all obstacles.

210
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:17,344
A love that can't be defeated ...

211
00:20:17,487 --> 00:20:21,048
... by parents, nations
or even death.

212
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:27,555
What about you? Have you
ever had a passionate love?

213
00:20:27,697 --> 00:20:29,062
Of course.

214
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:32,362
- My father?
- Mmm-hmm.

215
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:35,369
Do you still love him?

216
00:20:35,505 --> 00:20:38,565
I don't know.
I've forgotten everything.

217
00:20:45,482 --> 00:20:49,350
- Lies!
- It's true!

218
00:20:49,486 --> 00:20:54,549
- You still think about me, don't you?
- Once in a while.

219
00:20:54,691 --> 00:21:00,561
- What kind of thoughts?
- Thoughts of how much I owe you.

220
00:21:00,697 --> 00:21:04,463
Do you think Mina is a debt?

221
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:09,971
Mina is a gift.  The greatest
gift you ever gave to me.

222
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:13,872
Then what do you think
you owe me?

223
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:17,570
Happiness.

224
00:21:18,782 --> 00:21:25,551
I owe you my happiness.
And I owe Mina, as well.

225
00:21:25,689 --> 00:21:28,954
There's no way
I can repay you ...

226
00:21:29,092 --> 00:21:34,155
... but I can reward Mina, so I'll
do as much as I can for her.

227
00:21:34,297 --> 00:21:38,961
But I need your help.

228
00:21:39,102 --> 00:21:45,371
Help our Mina to only
know happiness ...

229
00:21:45,508 --> 00:21:47,271
... until she goes to you.

230
00:22:08,998 --> 00:22:12,764
"Hurry and open your window
or you'll regret it!"

231
00:24:09,285 --> 00:24:12,345
"Tonight, I'll wait for you.
Same time, same place."

232
00:24:41,084 --> 00:24:45,350
Hey!  Hey, there!
Room 306!

233
00:24:51,895 --> 00:24:53,760
Hey, you!
What are you doing there?

234
00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:57,161
Uh ... there ...

235
00:25:01,804 --> 00:25:06,173
There's a ... m-mouse ...
on the window ledge.

236
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:08,677
A mouse at night ...

237
00:25:10,713 --> 00:25:13,739
What a strange boy ...

238
00:25:33,102 --> 00:25:34,660
You know ...

239
00:25:36,205 --> 00:25:39,174
You knew my hand was like this
before you gave birth, right?

240
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,678
I read that people
get abortions ...

241
00:25:42,812 --> 00:25:46,543
... for much smaller problems.

242
00:25:47,483 --> 00:25:50,145
Why didn't you do that?

243
00:26:07,103 --> 00:26:10,266
Mina, you're all
grown up now, right?

244
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:18,174
There's one secret that
I've never told anyone.

245
00:26:21,484 --> 00:26:24,749
I didn't want to tell you in a
time or place like this.

246
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:29,747
What is it?  Tell me.

247
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:35,757
The truth is, your father ...

248
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:38,765
... isn't your real father.

249
00:26:39,502 --> 00:26:42,369
Your hand looks just like
your father's did.

250
00:26:42,505 --> 00:26:45,565
Your father was an alien.

251
00:26:59,188 --> 00:27:01,554
- Get out!
- Fooled you, didn't I?

252
00:27:01,691 --> 00:27:03,056
- No way! I didn't ...
- I had you going!

253
00:27:03,192 --> 00:27:06,355
You totally believed me
for about 30 seconds.

254
00:27:06,496 --> 00:27:07,861
Cut it out!

255
00:27:21,511 --> 00:27:23,570
Maybe three seconds.

256
00:27:44,801 --> 00:27:49,170
Someone left this at the door
Is it yours, Mina?

257
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,670
Oh, my!

258
00:28:01,084 --> 00:28:04,144
"This turtle cannot live
without its mate ..."

259
00:28:04,287 --> 00:28:06,152
"... and I've taken the
other one hostage."

260
00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:08,348
"If you don't want
the turtles to die ..."

261
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:10,459
"... surrender now."

262
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:19,263
Aw... it's so sweet!

263
00:28:36,285 --> 00:28:37,752
Come on in!

264
00:28:43,793 --> 00:28:46,159
Why are you standing there?

265
00:28:46,295 --> 00:28:50,356
You think I set a trap?

266
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,977
What kind of house is this?

267
00:29:02,111 --> 00:29:04,978
This apartment was just a studio
to start with.

268
00:29:06,883 --> 00:29:10,751
The owner let me rent it cheap
provided he could leave his stuff here.

269
00:29:12,388 --> 00:29:14,549
Say, why are you empty-handed?
Where's my turtle?

270
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,658
Wasn't it a present for me?

271
00:29:16,793 --> 00:29:19,455
A present?  That was just bait!

272
00:29:20,296 --> 00:29:22,264
Then I spit the bait out ...

273
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:23,956
... so give me back my lighter.

274
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,967
What a heartless neighbor!

275
00:29:27,103 --> 00:29:29,264
Okay, wait a second.

276
00:29:29,405 --> 00:29:31,066
Where did I put that lighter?

277
00:29:45,588 --> 00:29:47,351
I can't find it right now.
Use this one instead.

278
00:29:50,526 --> 00:29:51,993
"Call, when you are lonely."

279
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,959
Oh, hey, that's not mine.

280
00:30:02,004 --> 00:30:06,270
This must be my friend's.
What a clumsy guy he is.

281
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:11,468
Here it is.
"Heran Erotic Massage"

282
00:30:13,082 --> 00:30:14,549
Wait a sec!
Where did I ...

283
00:30:17,687 --> 00:30:19,655
I don't care.
I just want mine back.

284
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:24,453
I'm sure I put it
somewhere safe.

285
00:30:25,494 --> 00:30:28,861
It's really important to me!
Find it right now.

286
00:30:28,998 --> 00:30:32,559
Don't worry, I'll find it.

287
00:30:32,702 --> 00:30:36,661
I don't believe what you
say, Mister, just find it!

288
00:30:36,806 --> 00:30:41,266
"Mister?" I'm just a few years
oIder than you.

289
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,573
Call me "big brother".
Say it ... "bro-ther..."

290
00:30:46,782 --> 00:30:49,649
Hmm, you don't trust me
at all, do you?

291
00:30:49,785 --> 00:30:50,945
Wait ...

292
00:30:55,992 --> 00:30:57,254
Here!

293
00:30:58,194 --> 00:31:02,358
Take this as a hostage, to go
with the one in your house.

294
00:31:02,498 --> 00:31:06,662
I wanted to use them as bait,
but now they are real hostages.

295
00:31:06,802 --> 00:31:11,466
Wait a little, I will come
to save you soon.

296
00:31:11,607 --> 00:31:13,666
Don't make any trouble.

297
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:18,178
Oh well, at least she won't
eat you or anything.

298
00:31:19,782 --> 00:31:21,841
By the way, what was your
number again?

299
00:31:21,984 --> 00:31:24,145
I memorized it from your phone
the other day ...

300
00:31:24,287 --> 00:31:25,447
... but I forgot it.

301
00:31:25,588 --> 00:31:27,146
What for?

302
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,258
Don't you want
your lighter back?

303
00:31:32,595 --> 00:31:35,257
- (011) 9262-8979.
- Hold on! Wait!

304
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:37,161
What was it?

305
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,359
(011) 9262-8979.

306
00:31:39,502 --> 00:31:44,371
(011) 9262-8979 ...
(011) 9262-8979 ...

307
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:47,869
What on earth are you doing now?

308
00:31:50,212 --> 00:31:53,841
It's okay.
Don't you watch TV at all?

309
00:31:53,983 --> 00:31:57,544
The TV ad says you can remove
stains like this easily.

310
00:31:57,687 --> 00:32:00,747
Huh?  Isn't this supposed to work?

311
00:32:18,507 --> 00:32:20,975
Erased! I think it's working now!

312
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,977
It should be.  What do you think
we're doing this for?

313
00:32:29,885 --> 00:32:33,446
Oh crap!  Crap!

314
00:32:33,589 --> 00:32:36,251
Why the hell did you do this?

315
00:32:36,392 --> 00:32:37,950
He's insane.

316
00:32:39,795 --> 00:32:41,160
I saw them just wipe it off on TV.

317
00:32:41,297 --> 00:32:44,061
This must be a different
kind of floor.

318
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,668
Of course it is, silly!

319
00:32:46,802 --> 00:32:50,169
Only new floors have that feature.

320
00:32:53,709 --> 00:32:56,371
He's not crazy.
He's just stupid.

321
00:32:56,512 --> 00:32:58,377
- How stupid?
- Wait a minute ...

322
00:32:58,514 --> 00:33:01,142
... isn't this Mina's
phone number?

323
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:03,148
Why did you write this?

324
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:04,445
What?

325
00:33:06,589 --> 00:33:08,056
Right!

326
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,454
"How come Mina's
number is here?"

327
00:33:10,593 --> 00:33:12,458
What the ...

328
00:33:14,697 --> 00:33:17,063
Oh!  I take photographs!

329
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:18,757
She's so pretty,
I was going ...

330
00:33:18,901 --> 00:33:20,562
to ask her to be my model.

331
00:33:20,703 --> 00:33:24,161
- Oh, It's nothing ...
- Hey, hey!

332
00:33:24,306 --> 00:33:27,173
Well, isn't that a typical way
to seduce a girl?

333
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:29,573
- No! It really isn't!
- You're right!

334
00:33:29,712 --> 00:33:33,739
He's trying to seduce me!
The photo thing is just an excuse.

335
00:33:33,883 --> 00:33:36,147
I knew it!
It's so obvious!

336
00:33:36,285 --> 00:33:40,153
Once you start taking photos,
he'll ask you to do a ... um ...

337
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:42,757
That ... what do you call it?

338
00:33:42,892 --> 00:33:46,157
A "noodle" model?

339
00:33:46,295 --> 00:33:50,356
You know ... a model
that poses naked?

340
00:33:50,499 --> 00:33:51,158
A nude model?

341
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:55,361
Yes, a nude model!

342
00:33:55,504 --> 00:33:59,167
Well, on the other hand ...

343
00:33:59,308 --> 00:34:02,072
... having a picture of you all young
and pretty wouldn't be that bad.

344
00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:04,771
Really? Then I should do it?

345
00:34:11,987 --> 00:34:16,356
Um, nice model.
Nice expression.

346
00:34:20,396 --> 00:34:21,454
Give me that.

347
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:35,877
- No?
- I don't smoke in the daytime.

348
00:34:37,313 --> 00:34:39,747
You suck at delinquency.

349
00:34:41,183 --> 00:34:42,445
Give it to me.

350
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:45,654
I'll show you.

351
00:34:47,089 --> 00:34:49,250
Let me show you
the easiest way.

352
00:34:49,391 --> 00:34:52,656
Set this on "P",
then it's automatic.

353
00:34:52,795 --> 00:34:54,660
Hold it at an angle, like this.

354
00:34:54,797 --> 00:34:57,357
And then press this button
to focus.

355
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:03,461
And after the "click" sound ...

356
00:35:03,606 --> 00:35:06,473
... just press the shutter.
Try it!

357
00:35:12,381 --> 00:35:15,350
Why take my lighter
when you've got so many already?

358
00:35:17,386 --> 00:35:19,547
Didn't you smoke yesterday?

359
00:35:19,688 --> 00:35:21,451
That's none of your business.

360
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,854
Did you or did you not think
of me when you were smoking?

361
00:35:26,095 --> 00:35:27,960
You did!

362
00:35:28,097 --> 00:35:30,065
You've started thinking
about me every time you smoke!

363
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:33,362
It's because I have your lighter.

364
00:35:33,502 --> 00:35:37,768
What do you think of my
"tension-creates-attraction" theory?

365
00:35:37,907 --> 00:35:42,071
No wonder you've got so many
lighters in your house.

366
00:35:42,211 --> 00:35:45,442
Okay, you deserve to meet me.
I agree!

367
00:35:45,581 --> 00:35:46,946
Who deserves whom?

368
00:35:47,082 --> 00:35:48,447
You and me.

369
00:35:49,885 --> 00:35:52,752
How dare an old guy like you say
such a thing to a young girl!

370
00:35:52,888 --> 00:35:54,947
I'm only a little older than you.

371
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:58,253
Besides, I treat people 10 years
older or younger like my own age.

372
00:35:59,895 --> 00:36:02,955
Then I should treat you
like my age too?

373
00:36:05,901 --> 00:36:08,563
I think I had crush on you
from the first time I saw you.

374
00:36:21,283 --> 00:36:22,841
I'm going home now.

375
00:36:28,997 --> 00:36:32,364
I heard that the downstairs boy
came by today?

376
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,559
Boy?

377
00:36:34,702 --> 00:36:40,163
How would I call him then?
Downstairs "fellow"? Downstairs "dude"?

378
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:43,672
I like that.

379
00:36:43,811 --> 00:36:47,440
I heard he gave you turtles?
What's the name?

380
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:49,140
"Neil" and "Armstrong".

381
00:36:49,284 --> 00:36:50,251
What?

382
00:36:53,187 --> 00:36:55,951
I mean the downstairs "dude".

383
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,557
Lee Young-Jae.

384
00:36:58,693 --> 00:37:02,561
- What does he do?
- Takes photographs.

385
00:37:02,697 --> 00:37:05,860
What a handsome guy
doing such a cool thing!

386
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,968
Which means he's just
a slacker.

387
00:37:08,102 --> 00:37:13,972
Well, he seems like a nice guy.
You know I have an eye for men.

388
00:37:14,509 --> 00:37:17,672
I can introduce you if you want.

389
00:37:17,812 --> 00:37:21,248
Never mind.
You keep him!

390
00:37:21,382 --> 00:37:23,850
I'd rather buy an egg and wait
for it to become a chicken to eat ...

391
00:37:23,985 --> 00:37:27,648
... then wait for that dude to grow up.

392
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,572
Kang Mina!

393
00:38:04,892 --> 00:38:06,553
It's going to rain today.

394
00:38:27,281 --> 00:38:29,249
Hi, my Mina!

395
00:38:29,384 --> 00:38:32,046
What's up with you
visiting me here?

396
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:35,849
To maintain my popularity.

397
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:40,154
Then why didn't you come to
the hospital to see me?

398
00:38:40,294 --> 00:38:43,957
Did you have to
bring me out here?

399
00:38:44,098 --> 00:38:47,465
You don't even want to
set one foot in the hospital?

400
00:38:47,602 --> 00:38:50,765
I even wish I could rip off your
nurse's uniform.

401
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:54,370
No, not today!

402
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:58,170
I'm wearing an old bra today.

403
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:07,047
It's raining!

404
00:39:07,588 --> 00:39:11,192
I don't have an umbrella.

405
00:39:11,192 --> 00:39:12,853
I have one. I'll walk
with you to the hospital.

406
00:39:12,994 --> 00:39:14,052
Mmm.

407
00:39:19,033 --> 00:39:21,001
Hey, you still don't
have a boyfriend?

408
00:39:23,037 --> 00:39:28,907
Except for eating meat,
I'm practically a monk.

409
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:31,302
Then you've never had a boyfriend?

410
00:39:32,046 --> 00:39:36,676
Well, can I call them "boyfriends"?

411
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:39,181
Why do you ask,
by the way?

412
00:39:41,722 --> 00:39:44,885
Have you got a boyfriend?

413
00:39:45,026 --> 00:39:46,493
Huh?

414
00:39:47,528 --> 00:39:49,496
No, I was just ...

415
00:39:53,935 --> 00:39:56,597
You really don't
need to feel insecure.

416
00:39:56,737 --> 00:39:58,898
Don't worry, just do
what you want to do.

417
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,806
There are no right answers.
Follow your feelings.

418
00:40:02,944 --> 00:40:06,471
- That's the right answer.
- Okay.

419
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,484
Okay.

420
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:14,781
I'm sorry but some customers just ...

421
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:17,584
... showed up without reservations.
Let's go some other time.

422
00:40:17,725 --> 00:40:18,783
How about these flowers, miss?

423
00:40:18,926 --> 00:40:20,985
- Over there!
- Okay.

424
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:24,393
Gosh, I am late!  I've got to go.
TaIk to you later, bye!

425
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:35,406
Hello?

426
00:40:35,943 --> 00:40:38,810
- What are you doing now?
- Going home.

427
00:40:38,946 --> 00:40:40,675
What will you do at home?

428
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:45,479
I've got lots of time.  Is there
anything you want to do with me?

429
00:40:47,922 --> 00:40:49,685
I want sacks.

430
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:58,098
What?  Sex!
Hello?  Hello?

431
00:40:58,232 --> 00:40:59,790
Mina?

432
00:41:02,637 --> 00:41:04,502
Well ... that is ...

433
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,401
After we've been
dating for a while.

434
00:41:08,543 --> 00:41:13,276
After we're really close ...

435
00:41:13,414 --> 00:41:17,180
I mean, when two people
really want each other.

436
00:41:17,318 --> 00:41:21,379
This is so embarrassing,
but I should be considerate.

437
00:41:22,423 --> 00:41:26,587
Oh god ... uh, but if you want to
do it, I'm sure I'd be good ...

438
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:29,189
Tramp!

439
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:32,094
No, I'm not!
It really sounded like that!

440
00:41:32,233 --> 00:41:34,701
And who call them
"sacks" these days?

441
00:41:46,147 --> 00:41:48,479
The way you talk to me has been
disrespectful lately.

442
00:41:48,616 --> 00:41:52,677
Didn't you say you treat most people
like they're your age? Oh! My bus!

443
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:08,798
Oh my! Look what you did!
What am I going to do?

444
00:42:08,936 --> 00:42:10,494
I'm so sorry.

445
00:42:15,543 --> 00:42:17,602
I'm sorry.

446
00:42:18,346 --> 00:42:22,476
It's okay.
It was an accident.

447
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:26,477
I apologize.

448
00:42:42,937 --> 00:42:43,699
Take off your glove.

449
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:46,705
- It's okay.
- It's all sticky!

450
00:43:02,723 --> 00:43:04,281
Is it ticklish?

451
00:43:04,425 --> 00:43:07,588
It may look strange,
but it works fine.

452
00:43:14,735 --> 00:43:18,193
Blast all the humans with your death ray!

453
00:43:33,621 --> 00:43:36,385
Hey, don't step on my head!

454
00:43:37,725 --> 00:43:41,889
- What are you doing under my legs?
- Enjoying the view.

455
00:43:43,731 --> 00:43:45,494
Hey, you hungry?

456
00:43:46,834 --> 00:43:48,597
Here's a donut for you!

457
00:44:00,314 --> 00:44:03,579
Can't you do it better?
It can't make it up here!

458
00:44:21,936 --> 00:44:25,895
Hey!  What are you
doing up there?

459
00:44:32,146 --> 00:44:35,877
Hey Mina!
You ran off.

460
00:44:36,016 --> 00:44:37,483
Why did you leave me alone?

461
00:44:37,618 --> 00:44:39,085
The guard saw your
empty window ...

462
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,881
... and treated me like a prowler.

463
00:44:41,021 --> 00:44:42,579
You should thank me for ...

464
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:44,987
not shouting "Stop, thief!"

465
00:44:50,831 --> 00:44:52,594
Hello, ma'am.
How are you?

466
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:55,292
This is for you.

467
00:44:55,436 --> 00:44:57,495
Oh, I am sorry to
trouble you so often.

468
00:44:57,638 --> 00:44:58,400
You must be very tired?

469
00:44:58,539 --> 00:45:01,007
Yes, I'm a little worried about ...

470
00:45:01,142 --> 00:45:04,600
... the young man downstairs.

471
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:06,770
Single guys living alone often ...

472
00:45:06,914 --> 00:45:08,779
... have booze and girls on their minds.

473
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:11,476
It gets on my nerves.

474
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:13,086
- I don't ...
- Take care!

475
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,486
Oh, you're leaving?
Take care!

476
00:45:22,129 --> 00:45:24,188
You shouldn't
look down on them.

477
00:45:24,331 --> 00:45:26,299
I couldn't help you even if
they ran away.

478
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:28,697
Don't you think they feel all
cooped up in a goldfish bowl?

479
00:45:28,836 --> 00:45:31,100
They should get some
fresh air sometimes.

480
00:45:35,843 --> 00:45:38,004
Am I that pretty?

481
00:45:38,145 --> 00:45:42,081
Well you have a disease too.
A "princess disease".

482
00:45:45,219 --> 00:45:47,483
Wow!  It's been a long time
since I've seen one of these.

483
00:45:47,621 --> 00:45:48,781
What is it?

484
00:45:48,923 --> 00:45:51,483
You don't know this?
It's a hopscotch grid!

485
00:45:53,828 --> 00:45:55,887
By the way, Misuk and I
are going to Europe.

486
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:57,588
Only two young girls together?

487
00:45:59,733 --> 00:46:02,702
Oh, Misuk is my mother.

488
00:46:02,837 --> 00:46:04,395
You're so sassy.

489
00:46:04,538 --> 00:46:07,098
How can you call your
mother by her name?

490
00:46:09,743 --> 00:46:12,007
Is she your stepmother?
I've not heard this story.

491
00:46:12,746 --> 00:46:14,680
What are you, some kind
of private investigator?

492
00:46:14,815 --> 00:46:20,185
Oh, no.  You know how
the maid talks sometimes.

493
00:46:24,425 --> 00:46:26,689
Since I was sick and
in the hospital ...

494
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:28,795
... instead of going to school -

495
00:46:28,929 --> 00:46:31,295
What's that got to do with
using your mom's name?

496
00:46:31,432 --> 00:46:34,094
- so I had no friends.

497
00:46:34,635 --> 00:46:35,795
The kids in my ward ...

498
00:46:35,936 --> 00:46:38,996
... were scared of my hand.

499
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:42,504
By the time we got used
to each other ...

500
00:46:42,643 --> 00:46:44,611
... and became friends ...

501
00:46:44,745 --> 00:46:48,181
... they'd get well and leave
the hospital.  Or they died.

502
00:46:48,315 --> 00:46:49,475
How about you?

503
00:46:49,617 --> 00:46:53,178
I was in and out of the hospital.

504
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,881
Once, after a big operation,
I was in a coma for months.

505
00:46:58,325 --> 00:47:00,486
Even if I'd wake up ...

506
00:47:00,628 --> 00:47:03,188
... I'd just catch
some other disease.

507
00:47:04,431 --> 00:47:07,491
Do you know what my nickname
was among the nurses?

508
00:47:07,635 --> 00:47:09,603
"The 13th Floor Fixture."

509
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:13,096
How about now?
Are you okay now?

510
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,606
- Yes, clearly.
- No, you're dead!

511
00:47:15,743 --> 00:47:16,801
What?

512
00:47:17,645 --> 00:47:19,476
You're dead if you
step on the crack!

513
00:47:31,825 --> 00:47:33,690
You were saying?

514
00:47:33,827 --> 00:47:36,694
I was always complaining about
having no friends.

515
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:39,697
So one day,
Misuk entered my room ...

516
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:42,495
... wearing pigtais, hoIding a doll ...

517
00:47:42,636 --> 00:47:51,101
... and she said, "Hi, my name
is Misuk.  Can we be friends?"

518
00:47:51,245 --> 00:47:56,080
- What a nice mother!
- I like her, too.

519
00:48:13,934 --> 00:48:15,299
Good night.

520
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,503
Why such a dutiful kiss?

521
00:48:21,642 --> 00:48:23,405
I'm being nice to you,
and you're complaining?

522
00:48:23,544 --> 00:48:26,775
Wait a minute.
You look different.

523
00:48:26,914 --> 00:48:29,974
Unnatural.
Do you have a boyfriend?

524
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:32,085
You've been practicing your
kissing, haven't you?

525
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:34,983
What?  Knock it off!

526
00:48:35,122 --> 00:48:40,389
Well, I see I've struck a nerve!
Who is he?

527
00:48:40,527 --> 00:48:42,586
I said there's nothing
to taIk about.

528
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:46,791
Anyway, good luck. Don't be too
difficult like you are with me.

529
00:48:46,934 --> 00:48:48,902
Be nice to him.

530
00:48:49,636 --> 00:48:52,104
I'm surprised!
Hooking up with boys ...

531
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,899
It's not like that!

532
00:48:55,943 --> 00:48:59,970
Aquarius?  Sorry, but you'll have
bad luck with boys all month.

533
00:49:00,114 --> 00:49:05,575
No way! I've got
3 blind dates next week.

534
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:08,085
Really? You know, I'm an expert
on juggling guys.

535
00:49:08,222 --> 00:49:09,689
Can't I go there
instead of you?

536
00:49:09,823 --> 00:49:10,881
Why you?
I shouId go.

537
00:49:11,025 --> 00:49:13,687
Stop fighting.  What's yours?
Let's decide from the sign.

538
00:49:13,827 --> 00:49:15,385
I'm a Capricorn.

539
00:49:15,529 --> 00:49:17,497
You go!  You've got
terrific luck with love.

540
00:49:17,631 --> 00:49:18,893
Of course!

541
00:49:19,033 --> 00:49:23,299
- No way! It's the same sign ...
- Hey ...

542
00:49:23,437 --> 00:49:25,701
Can I see the Zodiac too?

543
00:49:37,017 --> 00:49:40,180
LUCKY COLOR: ORANGE.
LUCKY ICON: PINK HEART.

544
00:49:52,933 --> 00:49:59,202
Wow, your maid is
really a fantastic cook!

545
00:49:59,339 --> 00:50:01,807
Did you take this picture yourself?

546
00:50:01,942 --> 00:50:03,910
Yes, in Hawaii.

547
00:50:04,845 --> 00:50:05,903
Hawaii?

548
00:50:06,914 --> 00:50:10,782
I went there as an assistant
making a fashion catalogue.

549
00:50:13,921 --> 00:50:17,379
Hmm ... not bad!
It must be nice to travel.

550
00:50:17,524 --> 00:50:19,788
But Hawaii's a little stale.

551
00:50:19,927 --> 00:50:21,690
Hawaii is "stale"?

552
00:50:21,829 --> 00:50:24,389
How about Europe, then?

553
00:50:24,531 --> 00:50:26,999
I began to like Hawaii so much
after I visited there.

554
00:50:27,134 --> 00:50:29,193
So I studied about it, and now ...

555
00:50:29,336 --> 00:50:31,600
... I am an expert on Hawaii.

556
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:33,797
I even studied
the Hawaiian language.

557
00:50:33,941 --> 00:50:35,602
"Ohno" means "delicious".

558
00:50:35,742 --> 00:50:37,903
Thank you is "mahalo".

559
00:50:47,821 --> 00:50:49,482
You always listen to
this song, don't you?

560
00:50:49,623 --> 00:50:52,091
Yes, I like it.

561
00:50:52,226 --> 00:50:56,492
Don't you think the lyrics are
a bit too depressing?

562
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:59,292
Really?  What do they mean?

563
00:51:00,033 --> 00:51:02,092
Well, it's just ...

564
00:51:03,237 --> 00:51:08,197
Will Neil and Armstrong become
big like this turtle one day?

565
00:51:08,342 --> 00:51:12,972
Hey, is this brain totally empty?
Hello! Anyone home?

566
00:51:13,113 --> 00:51:16,082
They're a totally different species.

567
00:51:16,216 --> 00:51:17,683
Look here!  Even where they live.

568
00:51:17,818 --> 00:51:21,686
This one lives in the sea, but
NeiI & Armstrong live in a fish bowl.

569
00:51:21,822 --> 00:51:24,188
You're so ignorant.

570
00:51:25,626 --> 00:51:28,993
Then is that why you look ugly?
Because you're so smart?

571
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:42,008
Now I know why I liked him
a lot from the beginning.

572
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:52,681
Is your father an alien, too?

573
00:52:30,524 --> 00:52:32,082
Before the main shooting ...

574
00:52:32,226 --> 00:52:35,992
... I need to get some
rough cuts first.

575
00:52:36,129 --> 00:52:40,293
I'd like to take some pictures here
before rehearsal starts.

576
00:52:40,834 --> 00:52:42,199
Shall we?

577
00:52:42,336 --> 00:52:44,395
- Wait a minute, please.
- Yes.

578
00:53:08,328 --> 00:53:10,193
WouId you like to try this on?

579
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:13,891
- Oh, no thanks.
- It's okay.

580
00:53:14,034 --> 00:53:15,695
You can try it.

581
00:53:55,942 --> 00:53:59,207
- Shall we start now?
- Sure.

582
00:54:08,722 --> 00:54:12,488
Now, hold this bar, and try this.

583
00:54:43,623 --> 00:54:46,683
And move your foot like this.

584
00:54:55,235 --> 00:54:56,600
Repeat.

585
00:55:08,415 --> 00:55:10,883
Now, shall we try?

586
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:27,195
Why don't you take
off your glove? It's slippery.

587
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:50,185
Oh, okay, yes.  Holding the bar ...

588
00:55:50,323 --> 00:55:53,292
... like this.

589
00:56:45,045 --> 00:56:46,478
Hey!

590
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:49,980
Miss!  Are you okay?

591
00:56:50,116 --> 00:56:51,674
Mina!  Mina!
What happened?

592
00:56:51,818 --> 00:56:52,682
I don't know!
She just -

593
00:56:52,819 --> 00:56:57,483
Mina!  Are you okay?
Mina!

594
00:56:57,624 --> 00:56:59,990
Look at me!
Call an ambulance!

595
00:57:00,126 --> 00:57:02,492
Mina!  Mina ...

596
00:57:17,844 --> 00:57:19,402
Are you okay now?

597
00:57:20,914 --> 00:57:24,281
Where am I?
The hospital?

598
00:57:25,218 --> 00:57:28,278
No, you're at home.

599
00:57:28,421 --> 00:57:30,787
Then why is she here?

600
00:57:30,924 --> 00:57:34,087
There's no need to be rude.

601
00:57:34,227 --> 00:57:37,390
I came to see if you're okay.

602
00:57:39,633 --> 00:57:41,601
Are you going to put me
in the hospital?

603
00:57:41,735 --> 00:57:44,795
She says you don't need to.
Don't worry.

604
00:57:44,938 --> 00:57:49,602
The hospital is full anyway.
You wouldn't get in even if you begged.

605
00:57:49,743 --> 00:57:53,372
This IV is to rehydrate and give you
vitamins.  Now get some sleep.

606
00:57:53,513 --> 00:57:59,179
Misuk, why don't you go and work?
Don't stay home because of me.

607
00:57:59,319 --> 00:58:01,287
Okay.

608
00:58:01,421 --> 00:58:02,786
You can go now, too.

609
00:58:02,923 --> 00:58:05,289
I'll pull this out after it finishes.

610
00:58:05,425 --> 00:58:07,290
Yes, let's leave together.

611
00:58:07,427 --> 00:58:09,190
I'll give you a ride.

612
00:58:47,434 --> 00:58:48,992
Yun-Jung!

613
00:58:51,738 --> 00:58:56,505
You think I'm wrong
for discharging Mina ...

614
00:58:56,643 --> 00:58:59,407
... from the hospital like that?

615
00:59:00,914 --> 00:59:02,279
No.

616
00:59:03,917 --> 00:59:05,475
The reason I let Mina stay
at home is because ...

617
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:09,088
... I want to be with her ...

618
00:59:09,723 --> 00:59:12,886
... even if it's
for just one more day.

619
00:59:15,528 --> 00:59:17,086
Mina ...

620
00:59:18,231 --> 00:59:21,598
... when she was hospitalized
again last year ...

621
00:59:21,735 --> 00:59:24,203
... she cut her wrists.

622
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:31,203
When I got back to her room
after admitting her ...

623
00:59:33,413 --> 00:59:36,382
... her sheets were covered
with blood ...

624
00:59:44,424 --> 00:59:46,892
So ...

625
00:59:48,028 --> 00:59:53,591
... please don't accuse me of
not doing anything for her.

626
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,382
Ah, this is nice!

627
01:01:56,523 --> 01:01:59,788
You see?
Isn't it nice out here?

628
01:01:59,926 --> 01:02:02,486
- Aren't you cold?
- I'm alright.

629
01:02:02,629 --> 01:02:04,187
I feel much better now.

630
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:07,891
I was itching to go out
after staying inside all day.

631
01:02:08,034 --> 01:02:11,299
It seems that you enjoy going
out a lot these days.

632
01:02:11,437 --> 01:02:13,803
Hey, why don't you stand up
and push me?

633
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,999
Hey, I'm the patient.

634
01:02:16,142 --> 01:02:19,111
Right, you stay there
and I'll push you.

635
01:02:19,245 --> 01:02:22,271
Weren't you thinking I'd say that?
Stop nagging and push me.

636
01:02:22,715 --> 01:02:26,481
- So this why you gave birth to me?
- Yes.

637
01:02:30,623 --> 01:02:32,784
How did you feel wearing
ballet slippers today?

638
01:02:32,926 --> 01:02:34,894
It was okay.

639
01:02:35,028 --> 01:02:38,191
I think ballet isn't as elegant
as I thought before.

640
01:02:38,331 --> 01:02:40,094
It's very hard work.

641
01:02:40,233 --> 01:02:42,895
That's why I didn't want
you to do ballet.

642
01:02:43,036 --> 01:02:47,405
They say 30% of ballerinas
are in chronic pain.

643
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:48,700
Okay.

644
01:02:48,842 --> 01:02:50,605
So don't work too hard.

645
01:02:50,743 --> 01:02:54,372
And don't skip any of your medicine.
If you start to feel anemic -

646
01:02:54,514 --> 01:02:57,381
Boring.  Stop it.

647
01:02:57,517 --> 01:02:59,382
Okay, I'll stop.

648
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:01,180
But please keep pushing me.

649
01:03:01,321 --> 01:03:02,481
No.

650
01:03:02,622 --> 01:03:05,284
If you push me, I will take you
to Europe next month.

651
01:03:05,425 --> 01:03:06,790
Next month?

652
01:03:07,927 --> 01:03:12,091
- What about school?
- You can skip it.

653
01:03:12,232 --> 01:03:14,996
That doesn't sound like
something a mother wouId say.

654
01:03:17,337 --> 01:03:20,898
How about going to Hawaii
instead of Europe?

655
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:24,806
Why? Didn't you want to go to
a ballet performance in Europe?

656
01:03:24,944 --> 01:03:27,469
There's something I'd rather
see in Hawaii.

657
01:03:27,614 --> 01:03:33,075
Really?  Then we could go to Hawaii.
It'd be cheaper anyway.

658
01:03:33,219 --> 01:03:37,588
You know, I've been thinking
about it and ...

659
01:03:37,724 --> 01:03:40,989
... I don't think we want to go
as part of a tour group.

660
01:03:41,127 --> 01:03:44,392
Of course not.
That's not our style.

661
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:48,899
But it's dangerous for two pretty
young women to go by themselves.

662
01:03:49,035 --> 01:03:52,698
Especially as my beauty is so
internationally renowned.

663
01:03:52,839 --> 01:03:54,101
Obviously.

664
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:58,006
And if it's just us, we can't take
pictures of us together.

665
01:03:58,845 --> 01:04:00,369
You're absolutely right.

666
01:04:00,513 --> 01:04:03,073
Then, maybe we should
take someone with us?

667
01:04:03,216 --> 01:04:04,376
Yes.

668
01:04:04,517 --> 01:04:09,386
As a carrier and bodyguard.
As a photographer and tour guide.

669
01:04:12,225 --> 01:04:13,590
Can you come with us?

670
01:04:13,726 --> 01:04:15,887
- It would be an honor.
- Not you.

671
01:04:16,029 --> 01:04:17,587
My pleasure.

672
01:04:30,043 --> 01:04:32,705
- It's finished.
- Thank you.

673
01:04:33,212 --> 01:04:35,077
You see? I knew
it would be great.

674
01:04:35,214 --> 01:04:37,478
That's because my face is pretty.

675
01:04:37,617 --> 01:04:40,279
- Now, your turn.
- Oh, I'm ...

676
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:43,878
Why don't you have
a seat anyway?

677
01:04:44,924 --> 01:04:46,585
PIease make it really pretty.

678
01:04:51,431 --> 01:04:54,093
I'm a real genius to think of this!

679
01:04:54,233 --> 01:04:58,192
Such a great idea!

680
01:04:58,738 --> 01:05:00,797
This is your first manicure, right?

681
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:04,000
"Pedicure."  It's for the toes.

682
01:05:04,143 --> 01:05:08,773
Give me a break.

683
01:05:08,915 --> 01:05:12,373
Whatever it is, this is the
first time for me too.

684
01:05:16,322 --> 01:05:18,688
Oh, my lighter!

685
01:05:19,926 --> 01:05:21,393
I finally got it back.

686
01:05:22,228 --> 01:05:26,096
Hey, let me use it again
to light a cigarette.

687
01:05:26,232 --> 01:05:30,396
No way!
Here, I'll light it for you.

688
01:05:40,013 --> 01:05:41,981
Where did you get that?

689
01:05:42,115 --> 01:05:43,980
It's my father's.

690
01:05:44,117 --> 01:05:48,986
He didn't give it to me, actually.
Misuk was hiding it and I found it.

691
01:05:49,122 --> 01:05:50,680
Was he in the navy?

692
01:05:50,823 --> 01:05:52,586
Yes.

693
01:05:52,725 --> 01:05:54,590
What kind of man was he?

694
01:05:55,628 --> 01:05:58,188
We never talk about him.

695
01:05:58,331 --> 01:06:01,198
Misuk and I ... felt we'd just
get too depressed.

696
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:08,799
Hey, I think I will feel awkward
whenever I have to pee.

697
01:06:10,143 --> 01:06:11,405
Why?

698
01:06:11,544 --> 01:06:13,478
Because you'll always be watching!

699
01:06:14,514 --> 01:06:15,572
Ah!

700
01:06:17,517 --> 01:06:19,678
Cold!  Too cold!

701
01:07:13,739 --> 01:07:16,799
You'll end up an alcoholic
if you keep drinking like this.

702
01:07:16,943 --> 01:07:19,673
No, I'm okay.  Really.

703
01:07:19,812 --> 01:07:21,780
You seem worried.

704
01:07:21,914 --> 01:07:23,176
No.

705
01:07:23,516 --> 01:07:27,885
Why would I be worried when
I have such a pretty daughter?

706
01:07:28,721 --> 01:07:32,487
My Mina.  Will you live well
without me?

707
01:07:32,625 --> 01:07:34,593
Why? Do you want to
marry again?

708
01:07:34,727 --> 01:07:36,490
Will you?

709
01:07:37,029 --> 01:07:40,692
Worry about yourself.
I'll be fine.

710
01:07:41,434 --> 01:07:44,995
Yes, you'll be fine without me.

711
01:07:49,442 --> 01:07:53,071
Well ... do you like the
downstairs "dude"?

712
01:07:53,212 --> 01:07:56,670
I don't know!  What kind of
silly question is that?

713
01:07:56,816 --> 01:08:00,377
Tell me.  I'll help you.

714
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,283
It's not like that.

715
01:08:02,421 --> 01:08:04,685
Then what is it?

716
01:08:04,824 --> 01:08:11,992
It's just ... he's fun to be with
and he's nice to me.

717
01:08:12,131 --> 01:08:14,099
How nice!  I should thank him.

718
01:08:18,237 --> 01:08:22,196
Mina, have a great time in Hawaii.

719
01:10:01,741 --> 01:10:05,108
There's no way I can repay you ...

720
01:10:05,244 --> 01:10:11,774
... but I can reward Mina, so
I'll do as much as I can for her ...

721
01:10:11,917 --> 01:10:16,479
... so you must help me.

722
01:10:16,622 --> 01:10:20,285
Help our Mina to only
know happiness ...

723
01:10:20,426 --> 01:10:23,486
... until she goes to you.

724
01:10:23,629 --> 01:10:26,097
Help me ...

725
01:10:36,242 --> 01:10:38,107
Kang Mina!

726
01:10:38,744 --> 01:10:40,575
Mina!

727
01:10:41,113 --> 01:10:43,377
Mina!

728
01:10:46,619 --> 01:10:48,587
Hey, Mina!

729
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,591
Mina!

730
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,581
You ... your eyes are puffy?

731
01:11:22,722 --> 01:11:25,384
- I drank some beer last night.
- Alone?

732
01:11:25,524 --> 01:11:28,186
You drank alone, too.

733
01:11:35,835 --> 01:11:40,204
Wow.  What a nice surprise!

734
01:11:40,339 --> 01:11:43,706
Oh, right, it'll rain today.
Hold on, I'll get an umbrella.

735
01:11:53,719 --> 01:11:55,880
Mina, your umbrella!

736
01:12:18,144 --> 01:12:20,374
Hey, excuse me.

737
01:12:22,014 --> 01:12:24,380
Can you call Mina, please?

738
01:12:24,517 --> 01:12:26,382
- That girl?
- Yes.

739
01:12:56,715 --> 01:12:59,275
Something happened in the class?

740
01:13:55,841 --> 01:13:57,900
That poor guy is so sad.

741
01:14:02,014 --> 01:14:04,380
Losing his love,
being left alone ...

742
01:14:06,519 --> 01:14:10,785
... consumed by love.

743
01:14:21,634 --> 01:14:27,595
He is a very lucky man.
Not everyone can have that kind of love.

744
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:31,608
And he'll live with that love
forever in his heart.

745
01:15:44,817 --> 01:15:46,580
Mom!

746
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:48,380
Yes?

747
01:16:05,838 --> 01:16:11,105
If I lie here like this
I can only see the sky.

748
01:16:11,243 --> 01:16:14,076
I feel like I'm on an airplane.

749
01:16:14,213 --> 01:16:16,875
You've never been on an airplane.

750
01:16:19,118 --> 01:16:21,086
Do you think I can?

751
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,888
We will go to Hawaii soon.

752
01:16:25,124 --> 01:16:27,490
Right.

753
01:16:47,312 --> 01:16:49,371
Isn't there a regular customer ...

754
01:16:49,515 --> 01:16:52,279
... in this restaurant who likes you?

755
01:16:52,418 --> 01:16:56,787
Don't you know? All the guys who
come here, come to see me.

756
01:16:57,623 --> 01:16:59,784
No, I mean it.
Someone who's serious.

757
01:17:00,826 --> 01:17:02,885
Someone who's nice,
who you could marry.

758
01:17:03,028 --> 01:17:04,996
Now, with a little make up
you look nice ...

759
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:07,394
... but what will you do
after you get old?

760
01:17:07,533 --> 01:17:10,400
Children are no use
when you get old.

761
01:17:11,737 --> 01:17:17,107
What?  Now you have a boyfriend,
you don't need mom anymore?

762
01:17:17,242 --> 01:17:18,709
It's just ...

763
01:17:19,144 --> 01:17:22,477
I think you'll be lonely ...

764
01:17:22,614 --> 01:17:24,479
... after I get married and leave.

765
01:17:26,118 --> 01:17:27,676
Don't worry.

766
01:17:31,623 --> 01:17:33,181
I do worry.

767
01:17:36,528 --> 01:17:38,689
If you insist.

768
01:17:38,831 --> 01:17:42,699
I'll find a nice man soon.
Someone kind, with money.

769
01:17:42,835 --> 01:17:45,303
Are you sure you'll
call him "dad"?

770
01:17:45,437 --> 01:17:48,201
No way!  I don't even
call you "mom", only Misuk!

771
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:52,299
I'll just call his name.
"Hey, Bubba!"  Like that.

772
01:17:52,444 --> 01:17:54,173
No!  Never!

773
01:17:54,313 --> 01:17:57,680
You will call him, "Leonardo!"

774
01:17:57,816 --> 01:17:59,579
What!

775
01:18:09,328 --> 01:18:12,991
Mmm, the smell of dawn.

776
01:18:22,141 --> 01:18:23,608
Are you sleepy?

777
01:18:23,742 --> 01:18:28,679
Of course.
I just fell asleep.

778
01:18:30,015 --> 01:18:31,482
- What?
- This ...

779
01:18:31,617 --> 01:18:35,485
This is a present for a good kid
who got up early.

780
01:18:35,621 --> 01:18:36,781
.. and ...

781
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,984
... take these too.

782
01:18:40,425 --> 01:18:44,088
Why?  Don't you like them?

783
01:18:44,229 --> 01:18:47,198
I don't need hostages anymore.

784
01:18:47,332 --> 01:18:49,391
Now, I trust you.

785
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,601
Let's take a picture together.

786
01:18:58,143 --> 01:19:01,078
- Now?
- Yes!

787
01:19:01,213 --> 01:19:04,273
I'm very happy right now.

788
01:19:04,416 --> 01:19:05,781
Right at this moment.

789
01:19:05,918 --> 01:19:10,685
I want a witness who'll testify
that I was happy.

790
01:19:10,823 --> 01:19:15,283
You, Neil and Armstrong,
all in a picture together.

791
01:19:15,427 --> 01:19:18,988
But looking like this?

792
01:19:19,131 --> 01:19:22,191
Now is the best you've looked
since I've known you.

793
01:19:29,942 --> 01:19:31,807
Hurry!  Hurry!

794
01:20:22,327 --> 01:20:25,194
Mina!  What are you looking for?

795
01:20:25,330 --> 01:20:26,797
A sea turtle.

796
01:20:26,932 --> 01:20:29,196
Where is it, anyway?

797
01:20:29,334 --> 01:20:31,700
Why?  You'll go to Hawaii
to see one soon, anyway.

798
01:20:31,837 --> 01:20:34,499
Didn't you say it would be hard
to find one, even in Hawaii?

799
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:39,202
Of course, not all people can find
a sea turtle, but I'll help you find one.

800
01:20:39,344 --> 01:20:43,576
No matter how difficult,
so don't worry.

801
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:56,286
The sea turtles aren't on display.
They're having their regular checkups.

802
01:20:56,428 --> 01:20:58,293
Why so disappointed?

803
01:20:58,430 --> 01:21:00,694
I'll show you a real one soon.

804
01:21:00,832 --> 01:21:03,096
One not locked up in a tiny aquarium ...

805
01:21:03,235 --> 01:21:05,396
... but one in the real Pacific.

806
01:21:06,038 --> 01:21:07,903
Let's get something nice to eat.

807
01:21:31,229 --> 01:21:33,493
Mina!  Mina!

808
01:21:33,932 --> 01:21:35,900
Mina!  Mina!

809
01:22:34,326 --> 01:22:36,886
That poor guy is so sad.

810
01:22:40,332 --> 01:22:42,892
Losing his love,
being left alone ...

811
01:22:45,037 --> 01:22:49,201
... consumed by love.

812
01:22:52,911 --> 01:22:55,072
Now, I trust you!

813
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:53,989
I want you to take this back.

814
01:25:06,811 --> 01:25:10,178
I should've noticed something
was wrong from the beginning.

815
01:25:10,315 --> 01:25:13,773
I thought it was a lot of money
just to spend time ...

816
01:25:13,919 --> 01:25:15,784
... with your daughter
and take pictures of her.

817
01:25:17,923 --> 01:25:20,084
If I take this, it means ...

818
01:25:21,726 --> 01:25:25,093
... I met Mina because of money.

819
01:25:26,631 --> 01:25:28,394
I can't do that.

820
01:25:32,237 --> 01:25:34,705
If I do that,
I could never see her again.

821
01:25:38,643 --> 01:25:40,577
Sorry.

822
01:25:41,813 --> 01:25:44,373
I am sorry.
Really sorry, Young-Jae.

823
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:12,774
Unlike what most people think,
Hawaii has distinct seasons.

824
01:26:13,311 --> 01:26:16,576
These distinctions are
clear to Hawaiians.

825
01:26:16,715 --> 01:26:20,879
It is summer when the ripe
mangoes begin to fall ...

826
01:26:21,019 --> 01:26:25,683
... and when you smell
ginger flowers in the wind.

827
01:26:25,824 --> 01:26:29,783
The signs of winter are the rains ...

828
01:26:29,928 --> 01:26:32,488
... and the huge waves
that surfers love.

829
01:26:33,231 --> 01:26:34,994
The people who live in cool places ...

830
01:26:35,133 --> 01:26:38,591
... such as Kauai and Maui Islands ...

831
01:26:38,737 --> 01:26:43,106
... gather by the fire
around Christmastime.

832
01:26:43,241 --> 01:26:46,870
Hawaii has a warm climate all year.

833
01:26:47,012 --> 01:26:51,574
Rainy from October to March,
dry from April to September.

834
01:26:51,716 --> 01:26:56,176
However, the weather changes
only slightly between seasons.

835
01:26:56,321 --> 01:27:01,691
So you can enjoy sunny skies
most of the year.

836
01:27:01,826 --> 01:27:06,092
You can often find sea turtles ...

837
01:27:06,231 --> 01:27:08,199
... along the coast ...

838
01:27:10,835 --> 01:27:12,894
... and the turtles are waiting ...

839
01:27:13,038 --> 01:27:16,405
... for Mina to come ...

840
01:27:17,242 --> 01:27:19,767
... and see them.

841
01:28:25,844 --> 01:28:28,574
Why don't you get some rest?
I'll stay here.

842
01:28:29,614 --> 01:28:31,081
Let's go, Misuk.

843
01:29:58,536 --> 01:30:01,004
What are we going to
talk about today?

844
01:30:06,511 --> 01:30:07,773
Oh, yes.

845
01:30:07,912 --> 01:30:11,575
We'll go to the West Beach
and see the "green flash" sunset.

846
01:30:13,117 --> 01:30:17,486
You can only see it on a
totally clear day ...

847
01:30:17,622 --> 01:30:20,284
... at the last moment when the sun
sinks beneath the horizon.

848
01:30:21,326 --> 01:30:24,887
Some say it will give you love.

849
01:30:25,029 --> 01:30:27,691
Some say it grants wishes.

850
01:33:14,932 --> 01:33:17,400
What is this?

851
01:33:17,535 --> 01:33:20,402
- Is that a real human hand?
- It's creepy.

852
01:33:20,538 --> 01:33:23,006
Yeah, it's creepy.
Let's go!

853
01:33:39,023 --> 01:33:40,888
We've graduated.

854
01:33:41,426 --> 01:33:44,088
All the good seasons are gone.

855
01:33:44,228 --> 01:33:46,196
Now what am I going
to do for a living?

856
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:49,299
Whatever you do,
just take care of yourself.

857
01:33:49,434 --> 01:33:51,197
Broken arms and broken legs ...

858
01:33:51,335 --> 01:33:52,495
Pathetic!

859
01:33:52,637 --> 01:33:55,105
Should we commit some kind of
wild scam together?

860
01:33:55,239 --> 01:33:57,605
- What?
- To make some money.

861
01:34:26,137 --> 01:34:28,002
I am so sorry.

862
01:34:28,139 --> 01:34:31,006
I know that I did
a terrible thing to you.

863
01:34:31,843 --> 01:34:34,676
PIease understand it as a
selfish mother's love ...

864
01:34:34,812 --> 01:34:36,871
... and forgive me ...

865
01:34:41,919 --> 01:34:43,477
... and one more ...

866
01:34:49,026 --> 01:34:50,994
... this ...

867
01:34:59,937 --> 01:35:05,898
"To my dear Young-Jae, who shared
the happiest time of my life."

868
01:36:06,037 --> 01:36:08,301
"To my dearest Mom ..."

869
01:36:16,814 --> 01:36:20,875
"I know it must've been hard for you
to do this for me, thank you."

870
01:36:22,019 --> 01:36:24,385
"I don't know how many
more days I have ..."

871
01:36:24,522 --> 01:36:26,990
"... but I'll be happy."

872
01:36:28,125 --> 01:36:32,994
"I want to give this to you
as a present, before I leave."

873
01:36:34,131 --> 01:36:37,999
"I'm happy now."

874
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:49,999
