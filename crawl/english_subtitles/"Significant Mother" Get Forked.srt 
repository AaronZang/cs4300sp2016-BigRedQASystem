1
00:00:02,241 --> 00:00:04,241
It was like a summer camp and a spa

2
00:00:04,243 --> 00:00:06,648
went to town on each other,
didn't do the hokey pokey

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,382
got pregnant and gave birth to this place.

4
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:12,068
I mean, we did a couple massages
in front of campfire...

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,070
And a moonlight zip line for two.

6
00:00:14,072 --> 00:00:15,738
You hate laying still for that long.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,739
You hate heights.

8
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:17,940
Not anymore.

9
00:00:17,942 --> 00:00:19,775
You know, I hate to admit it,

10
00:00:19,777 --> 00:00:22,245
but it sounds like you two are
actually improving each other.

11
00:00:22,247 --> 00:00:23,613
Yeah, he makes me a better person.

12
00:00:23,615 --> 00:00:25,147
- We make a great team.
- Yes!

13
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:27,016
You know who I make
a great team with? Tessie.

14
00:00:27,018 --> 00:00:28,284
Your dad got the Tesla?

15
00:00:28,286 --> 00:00:29,986
Yeah, and my phone works as a key.

16
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:32,154
I guess this is what
his midlife crisis looks like.

17
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:34,190
Almost as good-looking as yours.

18
00:00:34,192 --> 00:00:35,725
I want to see what Harrison's can do.

19
00:00:35,727 --> 00:00:38,494
No, no, no, no.
Hey, Dad trusted me to drive it.

20
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,730
Relax, honey. It's just a car.

21
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:42,798
But... hey, careful! Careful.

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,268
It's not the messiah. It's a car.

23
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,836
You really need to loosen up.

24
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,205
You know what? You need
someone to loosen you up.

25
00:00:49,207 --> 00:00:52,742
Yeah, like a girl that will
bring out another side of you.

26
00:00:52,744 --> 00:00:54,176

Now, I need you to put on

You know, when your feet wear protection,

00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,728

Is it weird that all
your songs are about Nathaniel?

164
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:05,060
No, because that's not true.

I'm writing one right now that's about you.

your gift of music with my ears.

In the meantime,

170
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:16,539
I can think
of a couple things you can open.

171
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:19,842
Not now, Samantha, you've got work to do.

00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:42,024
Oh, not good.

206
00:07:42,026 --> 00:07:44,994
I went out with tons of women
who seemed all wrong for me,

207
00:07:44,996 --> 00:07:47,329
and it turns out
they were all wrong for me.

208
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:49,598
So stick a fork in me, because I'm done.

209
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,268
No, no, no, wait. Give us one more chance.

You haven't seen Annie.

00:07:53,337 --> 00:07:54,503
Annie?

212
00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:56,138
Scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot.

213
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,274
You got forked without me?

214
00:07:58,276 --> 00:07:59,875
But this was our thing!

215
00:07:59,877 --> 00:08:02,544
Well, you were brewing. I was bored, and...

216
00:08:02,546 --> 00:08:05,047
Wow, you sure you want me
to go out with a girl

217
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:06,815
who lists sex as an interest?

218
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:10,653
At least she didn't list it
as an occupation, right?

219
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:12,154
Look, she's hot, she's different,

220
00:08:12,156 --> 00:08:13,689
and she's getting her master's degree.

221
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:15,524
She looks familiar.

222
00:08:15,526 --> 00:08:18,160
Oh, no. I'm not going out with
someone you already slept with.

223
00:08:18,162 --> 00:08:20,629
No, from something else.

224
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:22,765
Definitely didn't sleep with her.

225
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:25,234
Not that I wouldn't. I totally would.

226
00:08:26,704 --> 00:08:28,103
If I were you.

227
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:29,939
But I am me.

228
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:32,508
And the only person I totally
would with is my girlfriend,

229
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,076
even if she got forked without me.

230
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:35,511
Okay, so we are all in agreement

231
00:08:35,513 --> 00:08:36,946
that Nate should go out with Annie.

232
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:38,180
In an hour.

233
00:08:38,182 --> 00:08:40,249
- Wait, now?
- Whoa, wow, wow.

234
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:42,117
I'm sorry, it's just she was really pushing

235
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:44,286
to meet me... us... you.

236
00:08:44,288 --> 00:08:47,256
And she's kind of on her way
to Ruby Jewel's right now.

237
00:08:47,258 --> 00:08:48,757
I know I should have told you sooner.

238
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,125
Yes, you should have.

239
00:08:50,127 --> 00:08:51,794
Look, if this doesn't work out,

240
00:08:51,796 --> 00:08:57,132
I will never set you up again, ever, eh?

241
00:08:57,134 --> 00:08:59,335
Eh?

242
00:08:59,337 --> 00:09:00,970
Yeah, fine. Deal.

243
00:09:00,972 --> 00:09:04,006
Yay! Yay, we did it again!

244
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:05,207
Hashtag!

245
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:08,277
Teamwork-ish.

246
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:14,350
I'm having a really good time.

247
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:15,918
Not that I thought I wouldn't,

248
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,487
but, well, I kind of thought I wouldn't.

249
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:20,689
Yeah, I've had a lot of bad dates too.

250
00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:22,391
This is...

251
00:09:22,393 --> 00:09:23,792
Refreshing.

252
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:25,561
Yeah.

253
00:09:25,563 --> 00:09:29,898
So tell me more.
Are you close with your parents?

254
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,633
Um...

255
00:09:31,635 --> 00:09:33,602
Did I strike a nerve?

256
00:09:33,604 --> 00:09:37,106
No, it's... it's just not
really first date fare.

257
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:39,174
Oh, who cares about dating rules?

258
00:09:39,176 --> 00:09:41,210
Let's live dangerously.

259
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:43,312
My dad's in jail. Your turn.

260
00:09:43,314 --> 00:09:45,647
My parents are getting divorced.

261
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:48,617
My mom got remarried to my dad's dad.

262
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:51,186
Well, my mom's dating my best friend.

263
00:09:51,188 --> 00:09:53,422
They have sex in my house.

264
00:09:53,424 --> 00:09:57,659
Is it weird that
weird family stuff turns me on?

265
00:10:01,532 --> 00:10:03,565
Do you have protection?

266
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:05,100
Uh, sort of.

267
00:10:05,102 --> 00:10:07,369
Never mind.

268
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:09,938
Pick a flavor.

269
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,907
Am I gonna taste it?

270
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,263
What did I do last night?

271
00:10:18,265 --> 00:10:20,699
Ahh, it's funny you should ask.

272
00:10:20,801 --> 00:10:23,034
I had the best sex ever!

273
00:10:23,036 --> 00:10:24,503
Mm.

274
00:10:24,505 --> 00:10:26,104
In the Tesla.

275
00:10:26,106 --> 00:10:27,706
Did you do it in the frunk or the trunk?

276
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:31,076
Oh, a gentleman does not kiss and tell.

277
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:32,711
So I'll tell you everything else we did.

278
00:10:32,713 --> 00:10:33,879
Mm!

279
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:37,082
- Jimm it felt so good.
- Oh.

280
00:10:37,084 --> 00:10:39,651
She made me feel... electric.

281
00:10:41,054 --> 00:10:43,555
I'm so proud of you, buddy!

282
00:10:43,557 --> 00:10:48,193
I mean, it was like
she knew every move in the book.

283
00:10:48,195 --> 00:10:51,029
Oh, my gosh. You're up!
How did it go last night?

284
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:53,265
- It went very well, Mom.
- Very well.

285
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:55,500
I even told her about you
guys, and she didn't freak out.

286
00:10:55,502 --> 00:10:57,269
And we're having dinner at Lincoln tonight,

287
00:10:57,271 --> 00:10:58,804
and she said she'd love to meet you both.

288
00:10:58,806 --> 00:11:00,172
Wow, you're really going for it.

289
00:11:00,174 --> 00:11:01,406
I'd love to meet her too.

290
00:11:01,408 --> 00:11:03,108
Okay, then I'll give her a call,

291
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,277
and you guys can swing by for a drink.

292
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,112
But one drink.

293
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:08,380
- All right.
- Okay.

294
00:11:08,382 --> 00:11:09,815
Ah!

295
00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:11,416
Teamwork!

296
00:11:11,418 --> 00:11:14,920
So I remembered
why Annie looked so familiar.

297
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:15,887
Why?

298
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:19,958
Oh, my God.

299
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
I set my baby up with a porn star?

300
00:11:21,962 --> 00:11:22,961
She's an amateur.

301
00:11:22,963 --> 00:11:24,262
I have to tell him.

302
00:11:24,264 --> 00:11:25,964
No, no, no. You can't tell him.

303
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:28,233
If he finds out she does porn,
he will never see her again,

304
00:11:28,235 --> 00:11:30,001
and he's just starting
to come out of his shell.

305
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:31,369
And, remember, we did this

306
00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:33,472
so Nate would meet someone different.

307
00:11:33,474 --> 00:11:34,973
She's different.

308
00:11:34,975 --> 00:11:37,909
There is different, and there's porn.

309
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:40,111
Oh, relax, Mom.

310
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:41,546
Never call me Mom.

311
00:11:41,548 --> 00:11:43,648
Okay. Let this play out naturally.

312
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,617
And I'm sure Annie will tell him

313
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:48,320
in her own time, when it's right.

314
00:11:48,322 --> 00:11:52,057
And if she doesn't, Nate will
work it out when she does that.

315
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:53,959
- Wow.
- We are on for tonight.

316
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:56,194
Just swing by, say hello.
It'll be a quickie.

317
00:11:56,196 --> 00:11:58,697
Honey, you know, we have
something to tell you...

318
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:00,131
We are excited about a quickie.

319
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:01,900
I just want to say
that you guys were right,

320
00:12:01,902 --> 00:12:03,802
so thank you for pushing me.

321
00:12:03,804 --> 00:12:06,137
I was really uptight, but with
AnniAn I'm finally relaxing.

322
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:07,873
So I'll see you tonight. All right?

323
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,141
Ba-da-pa. Ba-da-pa!

324
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:11,743
- See, I told you.
- Oh, my God.

325
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:12,878
Hashtag...

326
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,279
This isn't over.

327
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:19,217
Oh, sorry.

328
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:20,452
No, you're fine. You're fine.

329
00:12:20,454 --> 00:12:21,686
Keep your feet up.

330
00:12:21,688 --> 00:12:25,490
Dirty desk, dirty table, who cares?

331
00:12:25,492 --> 00:12:28,226
Okay, are you stoned again?

332
00:12:28,228 --> 00:12:29,995
Stoned on sex.

333
00:12:29,997 --> 00:12:32,597
Or high on sex.
I don't really know drug lingo.

334
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:36,601
But I had the best sex of my life...

335
00:12:37,804 --> 00:12:39,304
<i>In my dad's car.</i>

336
00:12:39,306 --> 00:12:41,206
Wow, I didn't think that was your thing.

337
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,774
Yeah, well, you know.

338
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:46,278
Old Nate... he would have
put down a protective sheet.

339
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,748
But new Nate... Oh, he went with it.

340
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,182
Thrice.

341
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:53,051
Okay.

342
00:12:53,053 --> 00:12:57,055
Well, new Sam is writing a song
about her feelings for Atticus.

343
00:12:57,057 --> 00:12:58,657
So...

344
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:02,894
Oh, okay.

345
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:06,665
It's not ready yet, but, um...

346
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:10,702
♪ Atticus, oh, Atticus ♪

347
00:13:10,704 --> 00:13:14,072

349
00:13:19,646 --> 00:13:20,879
It's not bad.

350
00:13:20,881 --> 00:13:22,981
But who's the song about?

351
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:24,516
Took me seven hours to write that.

352
00:13:24,518 --> 00:13:26,585
- I'm sorry.
- Why is it so hard?

353
00:13:26,587 --> 00:13:28,386
That's what Annie said last night.

354
00:13:28,388 --> 00:13:29,955
She was confused why you were hard?

355
00:13:29,957 --> 00:13:32,390
No, just thought maybe now that I was,

356
00:13:32,392 --> 00:13:34,326
you know, hooking up in cars...

357
00:13:34,328 --> 00:13:35,760
I could be the kind of guy

358
00:13:35,762 --> 00:13:36,962
who makes those kind of jokes.

359
00:13:36,964 --> 00:13:38,730
- No.
- No?

360
00:13:38,732 --> 00:13:40,966
Just like dating Atticus does
not make me the kind of girl

361
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:42,867
who can write songs about her feelings.

362
00:13:42,869 --> 00:13:44,569
Eh, at least I'm trying.

363
00:13:44,571 --> 00:13:46,838
You are. You're trying. We're both growing.

364
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,374
- Me? Like, 6 inches...
- Uhuh.

365
00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:51,109
You know, I regretted that immediately.

366
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:52,544

Annie, this is my mom, Lydia.

373
00:14:10,797 --> 00:14:11,997
my best friend/her boyfriend.

374
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:13,598
A multi-hyphenate. Great to meet you.

375
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,000
Will you join us for dinner?

376
00:14:15,002 --> 00:14:16,167
- No...
- Oh, yes. We'd love to.

377
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:17,168
Oh, no, they were j... Oh.

378
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,704
Yes. Oh, yes.

379
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:26,444
This restaurant is amazing.

380
00:14:26,446 --> 00:14:28,079
You must be so proud.

381
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:31,716
Yes. It's nice to see Nate's hard, smart,

382
00:14:31,718 --> 00:14:33,284
legitimate work pay off.

383
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:35,220
I love it when my hard work
pays off at my job too.

384
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:36,621
Oh, we don't need to get into that.

385
00:14:36,623 --> 00:14:37,956
Tell us about it.

386
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,658
Well, when things are hard,

387
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,095
I just push myself
that much more until, boom!

388
00:14:44,097 --> 00:14:46,464
Students with special needs
can read because of me.

389
00:14:46,466 --> 00:14:48,366
She's a teacher!

390
00:14:48,368 --> 00:14:50,869
Babe, aren't you so happy
we're getting to know Annie?

391
00:14:50,871 --> 00:14:52,170
I'm also a tech geek.

392
00:14:52,172 --> 00:14:53,838
I know more about the Tesla than this guy.

393
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,141
Yeah.

394
00:14:56,143 --> 00:14:59,277
So you would know how
to upload amateur videos online.

395
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:03,148
That's a random thing to ask.

396
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,849
We love amateur videos.

397
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:06,284
We actually made one ourselves.

398
00:15:06,286 --> 00:15:07,786
No, that was for private use.

399
00:15:07,788 --> 00:15:09,320
Guys...

400
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:11,189
You know, it must have been hard for you

401
00:15:11,191 --> 00:15:13,324
to reinvent yourself after your separation.

402
00:15:13,326 --> 00:15:15,827
I admire your courage.

403
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:19,831
Moving past your past is not easy.

404
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,167
Well, thank you. That was very nice.

405
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:24,135
I'm trying to reinvent myself too.

406
00:15:24,137 --> 00:15:25,670
But it's tough for people to see

407
00:15:25,672 --> 00:15:27,972
that I'm more than just my amateur videos.

408
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:31,209
Well, I... it's just, I...

409
00:15:31,211 --> 00:15:33,178
I get it, you're looking out for your son.

410
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,347
Who is very confused. What videos?

411
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:37,682
I have to pee.

412
00:15:37,684 --> 00:15:39,484
I'll let your mom explain everything.

413
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:48,426
What the hell is going on?

414
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:50,128
Nothing! It's not a big deal.

415
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,864
It seems like a pretty big deal. Jimmy?

416
00:15:52,866 --> 00:15:56,101
It's a funny story, actually.

417
00:15:56,103 --> 00:15:58,269
La-de-da. La-de-da.

418
00:15:58,271 --> 00:16:00,872
Annie does some porn.

419
00:16:00,874 --> 00:16:03,208
What?

420
00:16:05,112 --> 00:16:06,711
You set me up with a porn star?

421
00:16:06,713 --> 00:16:08,113
She's more of a character actress.

422
00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:09,314
Why didn't you tell me?

423
00:16:09,316 --> 00:16:10,682
She wanted to. I told her not to.

424
00:16:10,684 --> 00:16:12,283
But he was right.

425
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:14,185
He was right. I...

426
00:16:14,187 --> 00:16:16,888
I didn't give her a chance,
and I judged her like a mom.

427
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:20,024
And she actually seems
really nice. I'm sorry.

428
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:22,761
- So nice.
- Yeah.

429
00:16:22,763 --> 00:16:24,529
I'm sorry for breaking up our team.

430
00:16:24,531 --> 00:16:26,364
You were being protective and responsible.

431
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:27,398
Yeah.

432
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,433
I love that about you.

433
00:16:28,435 --> 00:16:29,667
Yes. Thank you for saying that.

434
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:30,869
We all make mistakes, and...

435
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:32,470
- It was...
- You grow, I grow.

436
00:16:32,472 --> 00:16:34,172
I don't even know
if it was really a mistake.

437
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:35,707
I was just waiting... No, you're right.

438
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:37,408
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Great. Okay?

439
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,577
Are we done with the cheesy
apologies? Because porn...

440
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:41,980
- She does porn!
- Oh, it's not a big deal.

441
00:16:41,982 --> 00:16:44,282
Except for her last video,
called "It's a Big Deal."

442
00:16:44,284 --> 00:16:45,917
Biggest deal I've ever seen.

443
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,752
I don't bowl because I can't wear shoes

444
00:16:47,754 --> 00:16:49,454
that have had too many feet in them.

445
00:16:49,456 --> 00:16:51,256
How many videos has she...
No, don't tell me.

446
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:53,291
No! I need to know. I have to look her up.

447
00:16:53,293 --> 00:16:54,692
Where's my phone? Where's my phone?

448
00:16:54,694 --> 00:16:56,594
- No, um...
- Where's my...

449
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:01,332
She stole my phone,
and she's stealing dad's Tesla!

450
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:04,335
Oh, no! No!

451
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:09,760
And that all happened in the Tesla?

452
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,895
- Yes.
- Impressive.

453
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,530
So does this Annie have a last name?

454
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:17,467
Well, they don't list
last names on Get Forked.

455
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,536
It's the dating app where my mom found her.

456
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,805
She sometimes goes by "Annie Hole."

457
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,673
Wow, you stuck
your Woody Allen in Annie Hole?

458
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,075
Good for you.

459
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,010
There's nothing good about this.

460
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,279
Relax, kid. You're insured.

461
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,847
I've seen her videos,

462
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,016
and a night with her is well
worth the cost of admission.

463
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,684
Which is nothing, because you're insured!

464
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:35,885
You got ofeasy.

465
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:40,256
Based on those videos, real easy.

466
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,527
I like that cop.

467
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:46,096
Look, I may be insured, but I still...

468
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,598
Oh, my God. It's her!

469
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,966
I mean, it's you! It's her!

470
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,735
Oh!

471
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,269
Annie? Where the hell are you?

472
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:55,772
I'm sorry, Nate. I really am.

473
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,273
Apologies don't make up for the fact

474
00:17:57,275 --> 00:17:58,975
that you're a porn star car thief!

475
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,277
I'm just trying to pay my way
through grad school.

476
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,679
You know how I feel

477
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,447
about teaching adults with special needs.

478
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:06,149
I did this for them.

479
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,550
For their reading.

480
00:18:07,552 --> 00:18:08,918
But I really did like you.

481
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,420
Really?

482
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,589
In another life,
this could have been something.

483
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,024
A little advice, though.

484
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,558
Maybe don't post pictures of yourself

485
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,294
in a $150,000 car on the Internet.

486
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:20,764
<i>Might attract the wrong kind of girl.</i>

487
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,268
- She hung up.
- Oh.

488
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,936
Oh, God.

489
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:28,938
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

490
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,141
I never should have gotten
involved in your love life.

491
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,275
No, no. It's mine too.

492
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,077
We pushed too hard,

493
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,547
and I guess the worst thing
that could happen is really bad.

494
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:38,982
I don't know. Maybe the cop's right.

495
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,350
I did get off easy.

496
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,785
I'm glad that you see it that way,

497
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,620
because I just wanted you
to keep an open mind

498
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,255
and try something different.

499
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:49,025
Yeah, because it worked out
well for you guys. I know.

500
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,593
Now how about we go get me tested?

501
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:52,262
I've already made an appointment. Come on.

502
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,296
- Very good.
- Oh, Mom.

503
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,531

- Yeah, sure.
