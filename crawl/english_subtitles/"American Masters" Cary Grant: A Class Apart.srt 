2
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,366
Not yet, Cary.

3
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,886
Not yet, Cary.

4
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,081
Okay, Cary. Now.

5
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,839
Hi!

6
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,482
Been seeing me in your dreams?

7
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,805
When you say movie star...

8
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,604
...Cary Grant epitomizes that persona.

9
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,243
It fit him.

10
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,120
First of all, he was the most
beautiful-Iooking human being.

11
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,882
The camera loved him.

12
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,207
- Something about my face.
- It's a nice face.

13
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,203
Cary Grant is the ideal fantasy figure.

14
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,201
The absolute essence...

15
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,163
...of glamour and sophistication,
attractiveness and smarts.

16
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,163
You're losing your eye.
You used to pitch better than that.

17
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:24,363
He had such fun in performing and you
could see that in the performance.

18
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,926
He was so full of joy and you
could see it in his body...

19
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,883
...you could see it on his face.
He just let it all out.

20
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,521
Oh, I'm so sorry.

21
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,448
It never looked like he was acting.

22
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,683
You thought that was Cary Grant,
off-screen and on-screen.

23
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,122
Watching Cary in a film, it seems
effortless. It seems he's playing himself.

24
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,488
What looked easy was a terrible
emotional complication for him.

25
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,724
I think he was a street fighter.
I trusted him...

26
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,085
...and I fell in love with him...

27
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,889
...and I was unable really
to cope with him.

28
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,764
We're only human, you know.

29
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,479
You... All of you with your
sophisticated ideas.

30
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,924
Ain't it awful?

31
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,602
When you talked to Cary, you never
could get past the Cary Grant persona.

32
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,364
Dry your eyes, baby,
it's out of character.

33
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,004
He keeps you on your toes.
He keeps you edgy.

34
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:21,204
You just never feel relaxed with him
entirely. He's too dangerous, too smart.

35
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,970
He was a work in progress.
Hollywood gave him a name...

36
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,122
...but he was the person who was
going to transform himself...

37
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,680
...from Archie Leach to Cary Grant.

38
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,085
Everybody wanted to be Cary Grant.
Cary said:

39
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,002
"Even I'd like to be Cary Grant."

40
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:41,518
There was no way he could possibly
embody all the facets that he portrayed.

41
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,360
"For more than half my 58 years,
I have peered from behind a façade.

42
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,603
The protection of that façade proved
both an advantage and a disadvantage.

43
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,809
If I couldn't see out,
how could anyone see in?"

44
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,881
People wanted to be associated
with Cary...

45
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,084
...wanted to be part of him.

46
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,765
Whether it be that they wanted him to
be Jewish because they were Jewish...

47
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,125
...to be gay because they were gay...

48
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,239
...so that they could've been in some
tiny, tiny little part of his life.

49
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:37,488
It is much more difficult to take
ahold of his persona...

50
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,285
...his career, nail it down
than people realize.

51
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,524
That's why he was so clever
about never really giving interviews...

52
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,810
...never talking about himself,
never letting anyone penetrate.

53
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,767
<i>The one exception was a series</i>
<i>of autobiographical essays...</i>

54
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,966
<i>... Grant wrote in 1963.</i>

55
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,804
You know where I grew up?

56
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,685
In a one-room shack with a dirt floor.

57
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,284
You talk about this side of your
family and that side.

58
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,283
As far as I know, we only had one side,
and it was awful poor.

59
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,680
"I was born in Bristol, England in 1904.

60
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:20,241
My family name is Leach, to which
was added Archibald Alexander...

61
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,129
...with no opportunity
for me to protest."

62
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,881
It hadn't been a very happy childhood.
His parents were not happily married.

63
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,928
"They were named Elias and Elsie Leach.

64
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,445
My father earned his money
pressing suits...

65
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,649
...and progressed too slowly
to satisfy my mother's dreams."

66
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,686
They rowed about everything.

67
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,480
He always felt
that he'd been responsible.

68
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,563
"My parents did not seem
particularly happy together...

69
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,641
...and I seemed to be caught
in a battle...

70
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,723
...which eventually took residence
inside my own character."

71
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,358
<i>Returning home from school one day...</i>

72
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,409
<i>... a 9-year-old Grant discovers</i>
<i>that his mother is gone.</i>

73
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,920
He was told his mother had gone to
the seaside, and she never came back.

74
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,964
He was filled with guilt
that he'd done something.

75
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,041
"There was a void in my life...

76
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,328
...a sadness of spirit that affected
each daily activity.

77
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,448
There was no further explanation
of Mother's absence."

78
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,319
His father also had an affair with another
woman and had a child with her...

79
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,129
...so it was very difficult
for him in many ways.

80
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,000
<i>Miserable at school and with</i>
<i>little parental supervision...</i>

81
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,446
<i>... Grant cuts class to attend local</i>
<i>stage shows.</i>

82
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,886
<i>Eager to belong, his constant</i>
<i>presence and sheer persistence...</i>

83
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,486
<i>... lands him a job as a lighting apprentice</i>
<i>at the Empire Theater.</i>

84
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,805
"The Saturday matinee was in full swing
when I arrived backstage...

85
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,889
...and that's when I knew. What other
life could there be but that of an actor?

86
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,884
They were classless and cheerful.
They traveled and toured.

87
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,202
I had a place to be,
and people let me be there."

88
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,999
He learned about the Pender Troupe,
and he wanted to join the group.

89
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,003
So he sent Bob Pender a letter
and signed his father's name.

90
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,606
Pender got the letter, accepted Cary...

91
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,285
...and all hell broke loose because the
father didn't know where he had gone.

92
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,248
Eventually he traced him and he was,
of course, returned...

93
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,767
...and went back to school and then
was eventually expelled from school...

94
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,087
...and finally went running back again
happily to the Pender group.

95
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,887
They traveled all through Great Britain
to all of the provinces.

96
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,126
This is where he learned pantomime...

97
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,084
...and juggling and pratfalls.
It's where he learned his timing...

98
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,766
...something that he carried with him
through the rest of his career.

99
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,047
<i>In 1920, the Pender Troupe</i>
<i>sails for America...</i>

100
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,441
<i>... to play New York's</i>
<i>Hippodrome Theater.</i>

101
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,885
To me it was extraordinary that this kid
had gone with the Pender Group...

102
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,049
...to New York and then, when they
went back to England, he stayed on.

103
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,761
He was only 18 years old,
all by himself.

104
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,319
It was very tough.
He hardly had any money at all.

105
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,924
He was doing virtually anything
he could do...

106
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,800
...including walking on stilts
to promote Coney Island...

107
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,519
...and selling ties on the street corner.
I mean, literally, anything.

108
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,126
<i>All the while, a determined Grant</i>
<i>auditions endlessly...</i>

109
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,680
<i>... and slowly begins to book jobs</i>
<i>on the vaudeville circuit.</i>

110
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,922
"I strove to make everything I did
at least appear relaxed.

111
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,083
Perhaps by relaxing outwardly,
I could eventually relax inwardly.

112
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,526
Sometimes I even began
to enjoy myself on stage."

113
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,443
<i>Now under contract</i>
<i>by the Hammerstein Organization...</i>

114
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,398
<i>... it is not until 1927 that he appears</i>
<i>in</i> Golden Dawn...

115
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,483
<i>... his first of many</i>
<i>Broadway productions.</i>

116
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,481
He was now a leading
man on Broadway...

117
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,403
...and his friends then became
John Quickney and Henry Ford.

118
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:08,406
He would be around somebody
that he'd admire, and he'd learn.

119
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,562
I daresay, he learned from these
playboys from New York...

120
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,722
...who were all rich,
came from good families...

121
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,848
...knew how to dress,
knew how to behave.

122
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,798
<i>Grant absorbs all he can</i>
<i>from high society...</i>

123
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,530
<i>... while continuing to perform</i>
<i>in season after season...</i>

124
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,124
<i>... of operettas, dramas</i>
<i>and light comedy.</i>

125
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,289
<i>He had now been performing on</i>
<i>the stage for almost half his life.</i>

126
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:36,444
<i>And in 1929, Grant is asked</i>
<i>to do a screen test.</i>

127
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,369
When he took his first screen test
for Fox, he was rejected.

128
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,122
He was told he didn't have a hope.

129
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,963
His neck was too thick,
and he was a little bow-legged.

130
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,281
So whoever that was
was maybe a little shortsighted.

131
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,205
<i>Undaunted by Fox's refusal,</i>
<i>a resourceful Grant...</i>

Well, I <i>sprechen sehr gut</i> Chinese to you.

136
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,526
You and me, we chop suey
through the park. We chow mein.

137
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,045
Hey? Hong Kong? Ping-Pong?
What do you say?

138
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,765
<i>From this inauspicious start...</i>

139
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,206
<i>... Grant is convinced that</i>
<i>he has a future in film.</i>

140
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,598
<i>He drives to Los Angeles...</i>

141
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,330
<i>... and after meeting the head</i>
<i>of Paramount at a party...</i>

<i>... is signed within a matter of weeks.</i>

<i>The studio immediately requests</i>
<i>that Archie Leach change his name.</i>

<i>in the play</i> Nicky...

<i>... and his surname from</i>

00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,723
<i>... including Carole Lombard</i>
<i>and Marlene Dietrich.</i>

150
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,719
There's where he's learning
his movie craft.

151
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:00,406
He is learning to listen,
to respond to the leading lady...

152
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,522
...to know where the focus
is supposed to be.

153
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,122
<i>Grant is 29 when Mae West</i>
<i>casts him...</i>

154
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,521
<i>... as her love interest</i>
<i>in</i> She Done Him Wrong.

155
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,163
- Well, then. Guess I'm taking your time.
- What do you suppose my time's for?

156
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,764
Sit down.

157
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,086
He's now only a pretty boy
in the West movies.

158
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,848
He's like upholstery. He's just there
to be her straight man.

159
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,526
That's it. Loosen up, unbend.
You'll feel better.

160
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,639
He was very stiff. He said, "You
notice how my hand is in my pocket...

161
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,802
...because I didn't know
what to do with my hands."

162
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,122
One of the few people that he
totally disliked was Mae West...

163
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,639
...who always claimed
that she had made him a star.

164
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,200
And he said, "Listen, I'd made
half a dozen movies before that."

165
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,760
So, you know, he felt he had
his own credentials.

166
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,525
He didn't need Mae West yammering
on about how she'd made him a star.

167
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:59,040
Come up again, anytime.

168
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,246
Thanks, I will.

169
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:06,006
<i>Nonetheless,</i> She Done Him Wrong <i>is</i>
<i>the young actor's biggest hit to date.</i>

170
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,809
<i>After appearing in eight films</i>
<i>in less than a year...</i>

171
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,848
<i>... Grant turns his attention</i>
<i>towards his personal life.</i>

172
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,921
- Hello, darling. Have a nice trip?
- Lovely.

173
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,919
- Say, where'd you get the flowers?
- From an admirer.

174
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,318
Not bad.

175
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,403
The first time Cary met Virginia Cherrill
was at one of the parties...

176
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,085
...at the Marion Davies' house.
She was a Chicago socialite, beautiful...

177
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,799
...had some fame because
she played the little blind girl...

178
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,042
...in Charlie Chaplin's <i>City Lights</i>.

179
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:39,682
<i>After a brief engagement,</i>
<i>Grant marries Cherrill in 1934.</i>

180
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:44,685
Cary's first wife, Virginia Cherrill, made
a remark which I think is very apropos.

181
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,365
"I was in love with Cary.

182
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,486
Cary was in love with himself.

183
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,040
I didn't stand a chance."

184
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:55,442
"I doubt if either of us was
capable of relaxing sufficiently...

185
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,919
...to trust the happiness
we might have had.

186
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,843
My possessiveness and fear
of losing her...

187
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,444
...brought about the very condition
it feared.

188
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,089
The loss of her."

189
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,447
<i>The couple divorced after less</i>
<i>than a year of marriage...</i>

190
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,885
<i>... and Grant returns to the</i>
<i>Malibu beach house...</i>

191
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,929
<i>... that he had been sharing with</i>
<i>fellow actor, Randolph Scott.</i>

192
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,205
<i>Although Grant was now earning a</i>
<i>comfortable living as a working actor...</i>

193
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,930
<i>... he had yet to give a</i>
<i>standout performance.</i>

194
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,366
He was a successful, young
leading man...

195
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,039
...who was nice-Iooking
but had no particular identity.

196
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,648
You can see him evolve in the movies
in the first few years.

197
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,367
His presence is straight leading man,
perfectly adequate...

198
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,920
...likable, almost too good-Iooking,
without a lot of depth...

199
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,207
...and there's glimmers
in a picture here, a picture there...

200
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,407
...but it explodes in <i>Sylvia Scarlett.</i>

201
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,319
There's room for both of us here. Come
on, get your pajamas, let's get curled up.

202
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,245
- But... But...
- But, but, but what?

203
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,198
<i>Grant is loaned out to RKO to star</i>
<i>opposite Katharine Hepburn...</i>

204
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,326
<i>... in George Cukor's</i> Sylvia Scarlett.

205
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,442
Jimmy Monkley, friend of the world,
nobody's enemy but me own.

206
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,329
Yeah, I can tell that
by the look of you.

207
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,324
He meets Kate...

208
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,923
A bit ticklish, aren't you?

209
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,121
...who is playing a boy in disguise.

210
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,322
Well, toodle-Ioo. See you later.

211
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:24,284
He played the sublime cockney,
absolutely relaxed.

212
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,169
He's himself and he's funny.

213
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:32,802
He knew what this character was,
and he gave a marvelous performance.

214
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,319
Gentlemen adventurer,
one of the hawks.

215
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,527
"Orcs"? Oh, hawks, hawks.

216
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,925
Yeah, hawks. The word "hawks."

217
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:43,082
Sparrows and hawks, that's humanity.

218
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,879
The hawks boss it over the sparrows,
that's nature.

219
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,484
You want to be a sparrow?
Look at them all around you.

220
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:52,323
What are they? Mere slaves. Me?

221
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,681
I'm out to beat the system.
Easy come, easy go. That's my motto.

222
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:59,678
<i>The film is a dismal failure</i>
<i>for the director and his star.</i>

223
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,968
<i>Yet Grant emerges not only unscathed</i>
<i>but more popular than ever.</i>

224
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,247
The fact that Cary was
being utterly dishonest...

225
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:13,085
...charmingly unscrupulous,
seemed to fit Cary.

226
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,282
He got the right part.

227
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,726
He suddenly flowered. He suddenly
felt the ground under his feet.

228
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,683
<i>Exhilarated after working</i>
<i>with Cukor and Hepburn...</i>

229
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,286
<i>... Grant returns to his home studio</i>
<i>with little enthusiasm.</i>

230
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,284
He quickly became discontented with
his arrangement at Paramount...

231
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:34,046
...because his roles were uninspired and
the projects were not very interesting.

232
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,360
So he became an independent...

233
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,328
...which was really unheard of
back in those days.

234
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,441
Extremely brave, I think,
at that stage...

235
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,999
...and it's a perfect example
of how bright Cary was.

236
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,962
He knew what he was
capable of doing...

237
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,167
...and he wanted to change
the mix a tiny bit.

238
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,601
And he was extremely successful,
got a percentage of the gross...

239
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,807
...and he actually asked for a percentage
of some of the films.

240
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,360
I remember once talking to him
about <i>Penny Serenade</i>, he says:

241
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,248
"Yeah, I just got a check on that."

242
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:07,165
I thought, "Jesus, that was 1941. He
had already got a piece of the action."

243
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:13,439
He got where he was
by working very, very hard.

244
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:17,962
Most self-made men, they say, "Pull
yourself up by your own bootstraps."

245
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,802
And Cary said that to me.

246
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,887
And I said, "First of all...

247
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,803
...how many people in the world...

248
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,882
...with bootstraps look like you?"

249
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,479
<i>Perfectly aware that his looks</i>
<i>have been an asset...</i>

250
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,847
<i>... Grant is eager to show the</i>
<i>audience what he is capable of.</i>

251
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,884
<i>He jumps at the chance to work with</i>
<i>director Leo McCarey and Irene Dunne...</i>

252
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,449
<i>... in</i> The Awful Truth.

253
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,965
- Well...
- How are you? I'm glad...

254
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:45,247
- Excuse me, what do you say?
- I say, I'm glad to know you.

255
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,968
How can you be glad to know me?

256
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,519
I know how I'd feel if I were
sitting with a girl...

257
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,920
...and her husband walked in.
- I'll bet you do.

258
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:56,720
<i>The Awful Truth</i> was the birth of the
Cary Grant we came to know and love.

259
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,649
He was wonderful, physically.

260
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,929
He could do wonderful pratfalls
and slapstick.

261
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:09,248
The fact that he threw his whole
being into it, no holds barred.

262
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,600
It was the first time
you saw a leading man...

263
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,449
...in that kind of comedy
being funny, really funny.

264
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,529
It was usually up to the woman.

265
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,163
- May I have a drink?
- Certainly.

266
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,686
I had three or four before I got here,
but they're beginning to wear off.

267
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,081
<i>The Awful Truth</i> is an
Irene Dunne movie.

268
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,885
She's the center of it.
She's on-screen more than he is.

269
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,964
I can't possibly interpret this as jealousy.

270
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,526
I've taken a definite turn for the better.

271
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,009
Nothing's gonna hurt me anymore.

272
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:44,642
She could not do the part she does
to the level she does it...

273
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,525
...without a partner of
his stature and ability.

274
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,888
Take it.

275
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,206
<i>Though this was regarded as</i>
<i>his breakthrough role...</i>

276
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,719
<i>... Grant is initially resistant</i>
<i>to his director.</i>

277
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:03,769
The way McCarey worked
was he would improvise the scenes.

278
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,569
When he couldn't think
of what to do, he'd say, "Hold it."

279
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,369
He'd go and play the piano for a while
and think about it.

280
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,407
Then he'd come back and say,
"Okay."

281
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,882
At the end of the first day,
Irene was crying.

282
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,610
She didn't know what kind
of a part she was playing.

283
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,445
Cary said, "Let me out of this and
I'll do another picture for nothing."

284
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,601
That's how we did it.
We never had a script.

285
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,729
<i>The chaos worked.</i>

286
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:31,122
<i>McCarey would go on to win an Oscar</i>
<i>and Grant became a star.</i>

287
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:34,088
The performance he was afraid of giving
in <i>The Awful Truth</i>...

288
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,810
...turned him into the Cary Grant
that we all know.

289
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,006
Cary caught on quickly.

290
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:43,368
It was right in his groove,
his kind of comedy, of humor.

291
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,040
He could laugh with you
as you were watching him.

292
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:51,840
He knew you were laughing,
and he was encouraging it.

293
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:56,640
That's what it's all about, falling in love
by being funny with each other.

294
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,842
He's really the only male star that
was made by screwball comedy.

295
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,729
Because usually that genre,
that style...

296
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,041
...made women stars.
It didn't make male stars.

297
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,640
<i>Grant is now one of the most</i>
<i>sought-after actors in Hollywood.</i>

298

303
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,168
"I learned that she had experienced
a nervous breakdown...

304
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,798
...and been taken to an institution.

305
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,768
I was a full-grown man living
in America...

306
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,205
...thousands of miles away in California.

307
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,760
I was known by most people of the
world by sight and by name...

308
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,522
...yet not to my own mother."

309
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:51,206
<i>Reunited, mother and son begin</i>
<i>an uneasy relationship.</i>

310
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:55,124
Cary had brought her a wonderful fur
coat he had made for her in New York.

311
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:59,283
And Cary told me, she looked
at him and she said:

312
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:05,047
"Archie, I've never seen so
many wrinkles in me life."

313
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,922
And it devastated him.

314
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,049
Devastated him.

315
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,080

<i>heiress and a lost dinosaur bone.</i>

318

Bringing Up Baby <i>is Grant's</i>
<i>introduction...</i>

319
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,808
<i>... into the world of</i>
<i>director Howard Hawks.</i>

320
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,679
Grant is a little nervous about the part,
didn't know how to approach it.

321
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:40,365
Hawks said, "Think of Harold Lloyd,"
and gave Grant the Harold Lloyd glasses.

322
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,318
Hey, that's my ball.

323
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,718
He ran with it.

324
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,241
- You shouldn't do that, you know.
- But...

325
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,844
- What shouldn't I do?
- Talk while someone's shooting.

326
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,887
I forgive you because I got a good shot.

327
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,847
He runs into this
harebrained heiress...

328
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,404
...who's completely impervious
to anyone's feelings.

329
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,965
- Get out of my car.
- Get off my running board.

330
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,519
- This is my running board!
- All right, honey!

331
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,806
She hears what he says,
but she doesn't listen.

332
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,249
Even though Katharine Hepburn
is driving him crazy...

333
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:14,289
...he realizes she's bringing him alive
in a way he's never been alive before.

334
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,446
- You're angry, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

335
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,841
The love impulse in man frequently
reveals itself in terms of conflict.

336
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,887
- The what impulse?
- Love impulse.

337
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:26,049
The back of Hepburn's dress being torn
off was come up with by Cary Grant.

338
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,320
I was only trying to be nice.

339
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,242
Thank you.

340
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:34,562
He had been first row of the balcony at
the giant Roxy Theater in New York City.

341
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:39,286
His fly was open, and it got caught
on the back of this woman's dress.

342
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,522
Instinctively, he just kind of got
behind her and followed her out.

343
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,840
He mentioned this to Hawks,
Hawks loved this...

344
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,087
...and came up with one of the
great sequences in American cinema.

345
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,524
- Get behind me.
- I am.

346
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,248
- Get closer.
- I can't get closer.

347
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,925
- You ready? Be calm. Left foot first.
- All right.

348
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,568
It gets sillier and sillier, like
<i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>...

349
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,563
...with all sorts of misconceptions,
they're out in the woods.

350
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,204
It's a kind of surreal screwball comedy.

351
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,884
Come on, Baby! Come on down.
Come on.

352
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,728
Oh, David, make him get down.

353
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:17,007
I suppose you'd like me to climb up
and push him down.

354
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,764
Well...
Well, maybe we better sing.

355
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,966
Well, sing, David.

356
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,526
Grant was concerned
that he was changing...

357
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,762
...or dropping his characterization
that he established early on...

358
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,125
...and Hawks said to him,
"No, you're changing."

359
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,919
- Run, Susan, while you have the chance!
- No, I won't leave you. I love you.

360
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,327
You are actually changing
under the influence...

361
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:49,245
...of this Katharine Hepburn character,
so you are becoming a bit more normal.

362
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,487
I've discovered that was the best
day I ever had in my whole life.

363
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,689
David, you don't mean that.

364
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,243
I never had a better time.

365
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,283
Even though the impression
that he had...

366
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,881
...is that it was a destructive
influence in his life...

367
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,486
...that's one thing that makes it so
extraordinary. Everybody is loony.

368
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,203
It's a one-of-a-kind movie.

369
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,808
- David, can you ever forgive me?
- Oh, dear.

370
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,167
- I, I...
- You can, and you still love me.

371
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,959
- Susan, that...
- You do? Oh, David!

372
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,724
Oh, dear. Oh, my.

373
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,967
<i>It will be four years before</i>

Linda.

382
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:59,209
<i>Holiday</i> expresses the kind of
<i>joie de vivre</i> that Cary had in life.

383
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:02,407
You get a sense of that in that picture.

384
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:06,125
When he enters this enormous mansion
where Katharine Hepburn lives...

385
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,689
Judas!

386
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:11,365
...he's overwhelmed by it, and he has
a kind of loose, shambling walk...

387
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,806
...like he's still a country boy
whose clothes didn't quite fit.

388
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,762
You accept him as a natural
free spirit who...

389
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,848
Trying to attain some respectability
and earn money...

390
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,602
...but that's not really who he is.

391
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,483
I've been working since I was 10,
I want to find out why.

392
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,046
The answer can't be just to pay bills
and to pile up more money.

393
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,882
The government takes most of it.

394
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,483
Yes, but what is the answer?

395
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,766
I don't know.
That's what I intend to find out.

396
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:43,840
Here he is in <i>Holiday</i> challenging
the ongoing attitude of the times.

397
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:49,926
I mean, that's a figure that belongs
more in the 1960s or 1970s.

398
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,805
<i>During filming, Grant is able to combine</i>
<i>a growing dramatic skill...</i>

399
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,006
<i>... with his characteristic light touch.</i>

400
00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:01,767
He developed this style of comedy
and this dash, this dapper thing.

401
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:05,047
You see, he didn't depend
on his looks.

402
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,166
He wasn't a narcissist.

403
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:11,289
He acted as though he were
just an ordinary young man.

404
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,128
That made it all the more appealing.

405
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,844
When things get tough,
when I feel a worry coming on...

406
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,921
...you know what I do.

407
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,729
There! And then the worries are over.

408

<i>Fulfilling a boyhood fantasy...</i>

409

<i>... Grant leaves the confines</i>
<i>of the sound stage...</i>

410
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,922
<i>... for George Stevens '</i> Gunga Din.

411

<i>... Grant stars alongside the icon 's son.</i>

413
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,282
<i>The spirited atmosphere on the set...</i>

414
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:44,523
<i>... even extends itself to one</i>
<i>important casting decision.</i>

415
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,925
Cary said that he was
interested in <i>Gunga Din</i>...

416
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,479
...and I said, "Which part
did you want me to play?"

417
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,008
He said, "Toss a coin,"
and it was decided as simply as that.

418
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,641
And that's how it happened
that I won the girl.

419
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,638
<i>Second only to</i> Gone With the Wind <i>as</i>
<i>the year's biggest moneymaker...</i>

420

<i>... Grant would often count the film</i>
<i>as one of his favorites.</i>

421
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,125
<i>Gunga Din</i> really was the <i>Star Wars</i>
of its time.

422
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:12,965
It captivated kids in that same way.

<i>Grant now adds action hero</i>
<i>to his résumé.</i>

425

Cary Grant was always Cary Grant...

426
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,766
...but different textures of Cary Grant.

427
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:33,128
Within his parameters
and within that perimeter...

428
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,558
...there's a lot of stuff.

429
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:38,643
He had the great ability
of being able to play...

430
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:42,280
...everything from slapstick,
fall-down comedy...

431
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,601
...to dramatic stuff
with a sense of danger.

432

<i>Director Howard Hawks casts Grant</i>
<i>in his first dramatic leading role:</i>

434

- There he is!
- Joe! Joe! Pull her up! Pull her up!

435
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,361
I've known a lot of flyers,

They don't sit and moan about what
will happen when they hit the ground.

437
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,366

00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,604
Haven't you any feelings?
Don't you realize he's dead?

441
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,647
- Who's dead?
- Yeah, who's dead?

442
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,084
- Joe!
- Joe?

443
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,320
- Who's Joe?
- Anybody know Joe?

444
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,282
There's a kind of ethos of stoicism...

445
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,600
...which grows out
of male companionship...

446
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:38,364
...or men doing something
they know is dangerous.

447
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:41,642
The only way to get through extreme
danger is with a high spirit...

448
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,927
...and we'll stick together
and that's the way we'll get through it.

449
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,008
You...!

450
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,845
Wait a minute, you little fool.
Why don't you use your head?

451
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,645
- Come on, stop it.
- How can you act like this...

452
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,448
...with that poor kid...?
- He's dead.

453
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,009
- Yes, he's dead.
- That's right.

454
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:02,242
He's been dead about 20 minutes
and all the weeping in the world...

455
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:05,243
...won't make him any deader
20 years from now.

456
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:08,163
If you feel like bawling,
how do you think we feel?

457
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,002
It's an incredible performance...

458
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,559
...and if you didn't have someone
as magnetic...

459
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,925
...and likable as Cary Grant...

460
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,684
...it would be possibly a very
tough character to take...

461
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:22,401
...because he treats people very
callously. He treats life very callously.

462
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,367
But Hawks knew how to
use movie stars...

463
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,361
...and he very shrewdly
used Cary Grant.

464
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,408
I don't know who else
could've pulled off that part.

465
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,565
<i>In direct contrast to his film persona...</i>

466
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,728
<i>... Grant's off-screen living arrangement</i>
<i>with Randolph Scott...</i>

467
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:43,166
<i>... continued to fuel rumors of the exact</i>
<i>nature of their relationship.</i>

468
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:46,481
Immediately they would say,
"These two were living together.

469
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:49,039
There must've been something
going on between them."

470
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,438
It wasn't the case at all.

471
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,802
The house they had down
on the beach...

472
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:57,280
...was known to have women
going in and out like running water...

473
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,327
...just as the one that Niven had...

474
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,958
...had alcohol going in and out
like running water.

475
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,489
It was a different time.

476
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,125
<i>A series of early publicity photos...</i>

477
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,805
<i>... and the fact that Grant returns to</i>
<i>live with Scott between marriages...</i>

478
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:15,407
<i>... confirms the idea for many</i>
<i>that the two were lovers.</i>

479
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,798
They were good friends...

480
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,803
...and those photos were taken
in a house they were sharing...

481
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,403
...and who knows who said:

482
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:24,846
"Maybe you could go a little closer
for the sake of the shot."

483
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:28,127
And suddenly these two are living
together as man and wife...

484
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,407
...as opposed to just as friends.

485
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:35,119
<i>Indifferent to the gossip,</i>
<i>Grant saved the newspaper clippings...</i>

486
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:38,600
<i>... and mementos charting their</i>
<i>friendship in his scrapbooks.</i>

487
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:42,126
<i>Scott signs a menu from a</i>
<i>memorable dinner party:</i>

488
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,929
<i>"To my spouse, Cary."</i>

489
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:50,363
For goodness sakes, why would I
believe that Cary was homosexual...

490
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:53,283
...when we were busy fucking?

491
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:59,163
Maybe he was bisexual, he lived
43 years before he met me.

492
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:01,002
I don't know what he did.

493
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,239
<i>Aware but indifferent to the rumors...</i>

494
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:08,767
<i>... the two even managed to poke fun</i>
<i>at themselves in</i> My Favorite Wife.

495
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,561
Once a rumor starts,
it is just perpetuated.

496
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:30,969
As Cary would say, sometimes if no one
can find anything bad to say about you...

497
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,280
...you are a tightwad
or you're homosexual.

498
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:36,288
<i>Grant and Scott</i>
<i>remained lifelong friends...</i>

499
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:41,399
<i>... and though the rumors never fade, no</i>
<i>damage is done to either man 's career.</i>

500
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:47,805
<i>Over 30 years will pass before</i>
<i>Grant finally addresses the issue.</i>

501
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,408
You won't be half as good
on any other paper and you know it.

502
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,004
We're a team!
You need me, and I need you...

503
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,484
Sold to the American!

504
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,763
<i>Grant and director Hawks reunite</i>
<i>for</i> His Girl Friday.

505
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,966
<i>Thrown into the chaos</i>
<i>is Rosalind Russell...</i>

506
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,167
<i>... in a remake of the stage classic</i>
The Front Page.

507
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:09,845
<i>The film will become renowned</i>
<i>for the speed of its dialogue.</i>

508
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:14,767
I didn't think it was particularly fast,
and in order to make <i>His Girl Friday</i>...

509
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:19,321
...which was the same story, faster,
we started using overlapping dialogue...

510
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,441
...and we stepped it up
about 20 percent.

511
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,841
Oh, Walter, you're wonderful
in a loathsome sort of way.

512
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:28,366
Now, will you be quiet long enough
for me to tell you what I came to say?

513
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,367
- I have a lunch date already.
- Break it.

514
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,760
I cannot break it.
Take your hands off of me!

515
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,966
- What are you playing, osteopath?
- Temper.

516
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:39,482
You can't have people talking and saying
important things at the same time.

517
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:43,768
They have to have a few words in front
and a few behind that can be lost...

518
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:47,047
...and out in the clear comes
the stuff that you ought to hear.

519
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:50,481
- I need that.
- Answer me, Hildy. You don't, do you?

520
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,720
Take those Miss America pictures
off page six.

521
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,608
Tell me. Please tell me the truth.

522
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,323
Wait a minute.

523
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,560
- Look here, my good man.
- You shut up, Burns.

524
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:01,324
- How can I do anything...?
- You're doing all this.

525
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:04,368
She wanted to get away from you
and everything you stand for...

526
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,758
...but you're too smart.

527
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:08,245
The script was 180 pages,
the movie is 90 minutes.

528
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:12,562
That means they were doing...
They were shooting 30 seconds a page.

529
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,244
That stuff was going by fast.

530
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:19,409
When Rosalind Russell realized how
brilliant Cary Grant was at ad-libs...

531
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:22,960
...she hired this writer to come up
with some lines for her...

532
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:26,088
...for the given situations
that she knew she would be facing.

533
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,008
Would you mind if I sat down?

534
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:31,088
There's been a lamp burning
in the window for you, honey. Here.

535
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,639
Oh, I jumped out that window
a long time ago, Walter.

536
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:38,122
He's malevolent as Walter Burns.
He has such a range of mockery.

537
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,888
- "Oh, Walter."
- Teasing.

538
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:43,565
I don't want to brag, but I've still got
the dimple, and in the same place.

539
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,880
- Taunting.
- Listen, you insignificant...

540
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:49,440
...square-toed, pimple-headed spy.
Do you realize what you're doing?

541
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,885
Grant himself,
apart from the character...

542
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:55,645
...is lovable because
he's obviously enjoying this.

543
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,807
All right, Hildy, you win. I'm licked.

544
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,759
<i>The chemistry Grant is able to establish</i>
<i>with yet another leading lady...</i>

545
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:07,765
<i>... is undeniable, and the film</i>
<i>is a resounding success.</i>

546
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:15,320
<i>After a string of box-office failures,</i>
<i>some of which included Grant...</i>

547
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,560
<i>... Katharine Hepburn</i>
<i>returned to the stage...</i>

548
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:22,963
<i>... finding her signature role as</i>
<i>Tracy Lord in</i> The Philadelphia Story.

549
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,724
<i>Realizing this was her entrée</i>
<i>back into films...</i>

550
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,279
<i>... Hepburn purchased the screen rights.</i>

551
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:32,648
<i>Requesting her dream cast, she was told</i>
<i>that Clark Gable wasn 't interested...</i>

552
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:35,119
<i>... and Spencer Tracy unavailable.</i>

553
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,804
<i>Instead Hepburn was</i>
<i>offered Jimmy Stewart</i>...

554
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:41,645
<i>... and $ 150,000</i>
<i>to find her third co-star.</i>

555
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:45,368
<i>Grant gladly accepted.</i>

556
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:49,006
<i>The Philadelphia Story</i> is about giving
Katharine Hepburn her comeuppance.

557
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:54,722
It's built around that. It's built to throw
water in her face and slap her down.

558
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,648
But he has to do it in a way
that it's not overbearing...

559
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,199
...where it's not too preachy,
where you don't think:

560
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,689
"God, you don't deserve her."

561
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:07,565
Which is kind of a tough thing to do.
It's a really deft piece of playing.

562
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:11,279
No, you're slipping, Red.
I used to be afraid of that look...

563
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,566
...the withering glance
of the goddess.

564
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,290
I didn't think that alcohol would...
Oh, shut up.

565
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:20,642
And he is, in his own way, despite the
sarcasm and mockery and everything...

566
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:25,247
...Ioyal to her, and shows that
he knows her and wants her.

567
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:28,482
He needs to be asked again,
because he screwed up the marriage.

568
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:32,006
You never had any understanding
of my deep and gorgeous thirst.

569
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,489
That was your problem.

570
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:37,609
Granted. But you took on that problem
with me when you took me, Red.

571
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,806
You were no helpmate there.
You were a scold.

572
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:42,723
It was disgusting.
It made you so unattractive.

573
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:47,560
Well, that's a really hard scene to play
because it's about explaining...

574
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:51,962
...who you are, which is the worst thing
any actor can be forced to do.

575
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,888
Strength is her religion, Mr. Connor.

576
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,447
She finds human imperfection
unforgivable.

577
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:00,443
When I discovered my relationship
to her was supposed to be...

578
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:04,046
...not that of a loving husband
and a good companion, but...

579
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:07,563
- Oh, never mind.
- Say it.

580
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:11,928
But that of a kind of high priest
to a virgin goddess.

581
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:15,719
Then my drinks grew deeper
and more frequent, that's all.

582
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:21,169
<i>Grant is perfectly at ease with</i>
<i>Hepburn and director George Cukor...</i>

583
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,321
<i>... free enough to bring</i>
<i>unexpected depth...</i>

584
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:26,607
<i>... as well as spontaneity</i>
<i>to his performance.</i>

585
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:31,645
- Oh, I wonder if I might borrow a drink.
- Certainly, like coals to Newcastle.

586
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,768
There is a moment in
<i>Philadelphia Story</i> that was...

587
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:38,121
...according to Grant and Stewart,
was improvised, is a scene...

588
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:41,959
...when Jimmy Stewart comes
to Cary Grant's house, and he's drunk.

589
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,683
And Jimmy Stewart hiccups.

590
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,324
Excuse me.

591
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:51,359
That was thrown in. You can see that
Jimmy is amused, and Cary looks down.

592
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,567
He was amused that Jimmy was
amused. They almost broke up.

593
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,169
But that's unusual.

594
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:59,248
C.K. Dexter Haven,
you have unsuspected depth.

595
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,763
Oh, thanks, old chap.

596
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,562
No matter how funny he was being...

597
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:06,359
...there was the sense of a kind of
serious person behind it...

598
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:09,403
...a real person, really interesting,
forceful person.

599
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,879
Oh, Dexter...

600
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:17,681
- I've done the most terrible thing to you.
- To me?

601
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,444
Oh, I doubt that.
I doubt it very much, dear.

602
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,566
You don't know. You don't know.

603
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,049
Well, maybe I shouldn't then.

604
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:27,765
But you must. You've got to.
I couldn't stand it if you didn't.

605
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:30,490
Dext, what am I going to do?

606
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:35,889
But why to me, darling? Why ask me?
Why do I come into it anymore?

607
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,723
She doesn't need to go
off with Jimmy Stewart.

608
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:43,486
She needs to return to the now
non-alcoholic C. Dexter Haven...

609
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,642
...who is the person
that she belongs with.

610
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,806
- Are you sure?
- I'll risk it. Will you?

611
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:51,279
You bet. You didn't do it
just to soften the blow?

612
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,929
- No, Tracy.
- Nor to save my face?

613
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:56,287
- It's a nice little face.
- Dext, I'll be yar. I'll promise to be yar.

614
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:59,522
- Be whatever you like. Are you all set?
- All set.

615
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,921
<i>The film is a hit and Hepburn</i>
<i>is back on top.</i>

616
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:14,527
<i>When the Oscar nominees are</i>
<i>announced, only Grant is overlooked.</i>

617
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:17,443
<i>The film is selected</i>

<i>... and Jimmy Stewart wins</i>
<i>as Best Actor of the Year.</i>

619
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:27,638
Cary gave his entire salary from <i>The</i>
<i>Philadelphia Story</i> to British War Relief.

620
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,963
He worked a great deal for war relief
programs and he visited army camps...

621
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:39,289
...and he toured with other
actors and actresses.

622
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,721
<i>Too old to serve,</i>
<i>Grant would continue to donate...</i>

623
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:46,883
<i>... portions of his salary</i>
<i>throughout World War II.</i>

624
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:50,765
<i>Now 36, Grant is paired once</i>
<i>again with Irene Dunne...</i>

<i>... and director George Stevens</i>
<i>in</i> Penny Serenade.

626
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:59,002
<i>Penny Serenade</i> is one of only two
films in which Cary Grant...

627
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,526
...received an Oscar nomination,
and significantly...

628
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:07,081
...he didn't play the Cary Grant
persona in either one of them.

629
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:11,966
- Have you got a Victrola inside?
- Why, yes, of course.

630
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,722
Would you let me hear this one?

631
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:16,927
Otherwise I'll have to take it home
and imagine how it sounds.

632
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:20,321
- Don't you have a machine at home?
- No.

633
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,286
Well, why on earth
did you buy a 27...?

634
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:36,848
He plays an ordinary man.
There is no tuxedo in this role.

635
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:40,286
He is a guy who doesn't
achieve much.

636
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:45,361
But the wonderful scene,
and unlike anything else in his career...

637
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:49,682
...is when he confronts an
unsympathetic judge to beg...

638
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,882
...to keep the little baby.

639
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:55,639
Look, judge, we've had
her over a year now.

640
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:58,643
Why, we've walked the floor
with her when she had the colic.

641
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,688
We've lost nights of sleep
worrying every time she cut a tooth.

642
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:05,126
We've gone through everything that
real parents have with their own.

643
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:07,890
It's a very powerful scene,
heartfelt, clearly.

644
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,399
He loved to make movies
about children.

645
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:16,088
Many of the productions he set up for
his own company had children involved.

646
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:21,165
Look, I'm not a big shot now. I'll do
anything. I'll work for anybody.

647
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,449
I'll beg. I'll borrow. I'II...

648
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:29,562
Please, judge, I'll sell anything
I've got until I get going again.

649
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,039
Only, she'll never go hungry
or go without clothes.

650
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,246
Not as long
as I've got two good hands.

651
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:37,607
<i>A disappointed Grant would lose</i>
<i>the Oscar to Gary Cooper...</i>

652
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:42,002
<i>... for his performance in</i> Sergeant York.
<i>But intent on exploring new roles...</i>

653
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:45,367
<i>... Grant begins production</i>
<i>on Alfred Hitchcock's</i> Suspicion...

654
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,407
<i>... in the spring of 1941.</i>

655
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:50,880
<i>This will be the first of four films</i>
<i>with the director who delights...</i>

656
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:54,565
<i>... in unconventional casting, enlisting</i>
<i>Grant to play a suspected murderer.</i>

657
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,883
Now, what did you think
I was trying to do? Kill you?

658
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:02,008
Nothing less than murder could justify
such violent self-defense.

659
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,649
- Look at you.
- Let me go.

660
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:06,961
<i>On the heels of her Oscar-nominated</i>
<i>performance in</i> Rebecca...

<i>... 22-year-old Joan Fontaine co-stars.</i>

662
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:15,922
It's based on a novel in which a rather
shady lady-killer marries an heiress...

663
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:21,323
...who is obviously a fortune hunter, and
it leads up to his actually killing his wife.

664
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:28,328
<i>Unusual for a Hitchcock film, there is</i>
<i>a great deal of tension on the set.</i>

665
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:32,324
<i>The script is incomplete.</i>
<i>Production drags on for five months...</i>

666
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,209
<i>... and Grant and Fontaine</i>
<i>do not get along.</i>

667
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:38,407
<i>Suspicion</i> is a botch,
but he's very exciting in it.

668
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:41,920
It's one of the few films
in which he's downright unpleasant.

669
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,728
Johnnie, get some water, quick.

670
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,921
It won't help.
I've seen this happen before.

671
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,808
There's nothing much you can do.

672
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:52,647
Oh, it's no use, darling.
It'll either kill him or go away by itself.

673
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,286
They never quite made up their mind...

674
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:02,839
...about who this character
was supposed to be.

675
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:06,042
They never made the basic
decisions you make about a character...

676
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,440
...when you tell an actor
what the part is about.

677
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,248
What do you know
about business?

678
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,480
Oh, very little. I was only...

679
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:15,369
Suppose Beaky had taken him
seriously. You'd ruin the scheme.

680
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:18,761
- You realize that?
- Yes, but it wasn't any good.

681
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:21,444
That's my business, not yours.

682
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,249
If I say it's good, it's good.

683

<i>Grant's character, a perplexing</i>
<i>blend of charm and menace...</i>

684
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:32,569

<i>RKO, forcing them to shoot two endings.</i>

685
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:37,526
<i>In the original novel, Grant's character</i>

<i>Before drinking it,</i>
<i>she hands him an envelope.</i>

687

<i>The letter inside names</i>
<i>Grant as her killer.</i>

<i>... unknowingly sealing his doom.</i>

690
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:53,841
Hitch said you can't have Cary Grant be
a murderer, because it's Cary Grant.

691
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:57,566
<i>Using a combination of new and</i>
<i>previously shot scenes...</i>

<i>... an ending is patched together.</i>

693
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:05,445
They were actually setting the entire
movie on fire before your very eyes...

694
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:09,649
...because by negating what has come
up until that point...

695
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,243
...it's an embarrassment.

696
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:14,567
<i>Nonetheless, Grant's persona</i>
<i>remains intact.</i>

697

<i>Fontaine wins the Oscar for her role...</i>

698

<i>most profitable film of the year.</i>

699
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:26,761
By the end of 1940
and coming into early '41...

700
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:31,128
...you see <i>The Philadelphia Story</i>,
<i>Penny Serenade</i>, <i>Suspicion</i>.

701
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:35,767
He can be a sophisticated,
comedy, leading romantic man.

702
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:40,521
He can be a suspected murderer
that's a complex character...

703
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:46,009
...and he can be an ordinary,
down-to-earth, simple family man.

704
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:50,123
Now, that's remarkable. And no one
ever thinks about this with Grant.

705
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:55,762
They have this one, much more
narrow idea of who he is on film.

706
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:01,166
<i>Grant begins dating Woolworth</i>
<i>heiress Barbara Hutton...</i>

707

<i>... while shooting</i>

<i>... and marries Hutton,</i>
<i>all within two weeks.</i>

710
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:15,480
<i>The press has a field day.</i>

711
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:19,962
<i>America 's richest woman has married</i>
<i>America 's biggest movie star...</i>

<i>... earning the couple the nickname</i>
<i>"Cash and Cary."</i>

713
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:29,683
Cary was married to my cousin Barbara
Hutton, and that's how I first met him.

714
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:35,084
I was about 16, I guess, or 17.
She was very beautiful, very beautiful.

715
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:39,960
She had these beautiful dark eyebrows
and huge blue eyes. She was gorgeous.

716
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:45,881
Cary gravitated towards women
of refinement. You see it now twice:

717
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:49,440
Virginia Cherrill
and now Barbara Hutton.

718
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:54,526
She was a difficult personality.
She had a very difficult childhood.

719
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,726
Her mother died when she was 8.

720
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:59,643
Her father was an alcoholic.
That was my father's brother.

721
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,488
The one thing that they had
in common was the fact that...

722
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:07,649
...neither one of them had
the love nor the care of a mother.

723
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:11,527
<i>A bright spot in the marriage</i>
<i>is Lance Reventlow...</i>

724
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:15,319
<i>... Hutton 's son from her previous</i>
<i>marriage to a Danish count.</i>

725
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:22,727
I was married to Barbara Hutton's son,
and Cary was literally a father to him.

726
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:28,283
<i>The victim of a bitter custody battle,</i>
<i>Lance prefers Grant to his own father.</i>

727
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:32,443
They had a wonderful relationship.
Cary adored him, and Lance adored Cary.

728
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,328
And it was a deep relationship.

729
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:38,642
<i>Despite Lance, Grant and Hutton 's</i>
<i>marriage quickly unravels...</i>

730
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:41,165
<i>... as the two struggle</i>
<i>with Grant's work ethic...</i>

731
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:44,242
<i>... versus Hutton 's constant need</i>
<i>to be entertained.</i>

732
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,878
Her friends didn't work.
Most of them were sycophants.

733
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:50,969
I knew some of those people later in my
life, and he was right to not like them.

734
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:53,803
They weren't that particularly terrific.

735
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:57,082
"Our marriage had little foundation
for a promising future.

736
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:00,128
Our backgrounds were
completely unalike.

737
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:03,282
Perhaps that in itself
was the initial attraction."

738
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:06,328
Cary and I talked about it many
times and he said, "You know...

739
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:10,199
...when you have that much money,
people treat you differently."

740
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:13,049
And Cary was treated differently
because he was an icon.

741
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:16,964
The difference there is Cary knew
why he was being treated differently.

742
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,358
Barbara didn't.

743
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:23,690
<i>The couple separate two years later,</i>
<i>and in 1945 finally divorce.</i>

744
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:26,887
But they certainly remained friends.
I mean, she would call him...

745
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,961
...right up to the time
before she died...

746
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:31,883
...and Cary was always very happy
to talk to her.

747
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:35,563
<i>Grant's next project</i>
<i>is his most personal.</i>

748
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:40,246
<i>At his insistence, RKO not only agrees</i>
<i>to produce</i> None But the Lonely Heart...

749
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:45,404
<i>... but to hire screenwriter</i>
<i>Clifford Odets to direct as well.</i>

750
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:52,444
- Anything in the shop needs mending?
- None that needs your help, Ernie.

751
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:54,885
Besides, it's Sunday.

752
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:58,800
Painting, polishing,
doing a spot of gardening?

753
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:01,962
Mean to do my best by you, Ma, love.

754
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:05,609
Happy couple, aren't we?

755
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:08,119
<i>None But the Lonely Heart</i>,
with Ethel Barrymore...

756
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,360
He played a cockney,
and she played his mum...

757
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:13,727
...was very close to his origins.
And it's an unrelentingly grim film.

758
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:16,279
"In many ways, the part
fit my nature better...

759
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:19,920
...than the lighthearted fellows
I was used to playing."

760
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:23,002
When he tried to expand and
work with Clifford Odets...

761
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:26,845
...who was a close personal friend of
his, trying to embody something else...

762
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:30,002
It's fascinating, too, because he tried
to use his physicality...

763
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:33,560
...in this really sort of swaggering,
butch kind of fashion.

764
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:37,722
- Look. Ain't I lovely?
- Rather dream, you are.

765
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:42,287
And it's about working-class squalor
and despair, and the central situation...

766
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:44,918
...is that he's come home
to his mom at long last...

767
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:47,524
...to be with her
while she dies of cancer.

768
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:51,160
<i>Clearly Grant was playing a role</i>
<i>written for someone half his age...</i>

769
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:54,128
<i>... affecting both the story</i>
<i>and his performance.</i>

770
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:57,362
<i>Ethel Barrymore wins the Oscar</i>
<i>as Best Supporting Actress...</i>

771
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:02,001
<i>... and although nominated for</i>
<i>Best Actor, Grant loses to Bing Crosby...</i>

772
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:04,400
<i>... and is never nominated again.</i>

773
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:09,047
It was a terrible flop,
and he never looked back.

774
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:15,281
He took me to a preview of a movie,
and he said:

775
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:20,604
The very important thing is that no
matter what people think of the movie...

776
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:24,604
...or anything, keep smiling.
If you show that you're vulnerable...

777
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:28,001
...and you show your feelings are hurt,
you'll be destroyed...

778
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:31,924
...and you mustn't, so keep smiling."

779
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:39,046
There are four directors who had a real
influence on the shaping of Cary Grant:

780
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:44,802
Alfred Hitchcock, Leo McCarey,
Howard Hawks and George Cukor.

781
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,207
"Each of those directors permitted
me the release of improvisation...

782
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:52,204
...during the rehearsal of each scene.
It permitted me to discover how far...

783
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:57,000
...I could go with confidence, while
guided by their quiet, sensitive approval."

784
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:02,039
Leo McCarey gave him
the pratfall, comedy persona.

785
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:05,885
Cukor adds the sophistication.

786
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:11,078
Hawks gives the masculinity,
the adventure...

787
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:13,724
...and then Hitchcock puts
it all together...

788
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:20,119
...and adds that little touch
of mystery and insanity.

789
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:30,889
<i>The director had learned</i>
<i>his lesson with</i> Suspicion.

790
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:34,167
<i>The Cary Grant persona had its limits.</i>

791
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,921
<i>With</i> Notorious<i>, Hitchcock achieves</i>
<i>the perfect balance.</i>

792
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:44,369
<i>Grant stars with Ingrid Bergman</i>
<i>as government agent T.R. Devlin.</i>

793
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:51,009
There's one more drink left apiece.
Shame about the ice.

794
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:53,001
- What is?
- It's gone.

795
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,081
- What's gone?
- The ice.

796
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:58,328
<i>Notorious</i> is one of Hitchcock's
two or three best pictures...

797
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:01,527
...and it's one of Cary's most
complicated performances.

798
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:05,040
<i>For Hitchcock, there was no such</i>
<i>thing as a straightforward love affair</i>.

799
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:07,963
<i>And so, despite Devlin 's</i>
<i>feelings for Alicia...</i>

800
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:10,849
<i>... he gives her the task</i>
<i>of seducing a Nazi criminal...</i>

801
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:14,605
<i>... and the audience watches</i>
<i>as he struggles with his inner turmoil.</i>

802
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:17,449
You land him, find out what's going
on inside his house...

803
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:20,841
...what the group around him
is up to and report to us.

804
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:26,849
I suppose you knew about this pretty
little job of mine all the time.

805
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:30,682
No. I only just found out about it.

806
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:34,644
He's very angry at her for acquiescing
in this plan a little too quickly...

807
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:37,529
...more quickly than he wants,
and he treats her as a slut.

808
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:40,927
You can add Sebastian's name
to my list of playmates.

809
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:48,204
Pretty fast work.

810
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:50,361
- That's what you wanted, wasn't it?
- Skip it.

811
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:53,880
He is a son of a bitch in this movie.
I mean, he's manipulative...

812
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:57,679
...and he's cold-hearted, and it's chilling
to watch how good he is at it.

813
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:00,523
Listen, you chalked up another boyfriend.
No harm done.

814
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,482
- I hate you.
- There's no occasion to.

815
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:03,878
You're doing good work.

816
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:07,087
What makes the movie romantic
is that his mistreatment of her...

817
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,889
...is brought out because
he's absolutely crazy about her.

818
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:13,042
I couldn't see straight
or think straight.

819
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:17,718
I was a fatheaded guy full of pain.

820
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:20,245
It tore me up not having you.

821
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:22,844
He didn't do that again
after that movie though.

822
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:25,359
It's like a kind of a blip in his career...

823
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:30,650
...and he went back to sort of being the
more or less conventional Cary Grant...

824
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:33,005
...and you feel the loss.

825
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,678
Miss Delwagon says
that middle-class people like us...

826
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,318
I know this is asking a lot,
but just one morning...

827
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:44,244
...I would like to sit down and have
breakfast without social significance.

828
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:47,442
Jim, you must take more interest
in your children's education.

829
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:49,880
Can't squeeze blood from a turnip.

830
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:55,569
When I was growing up, the big
Cary Grant films were things like...

831
00:49:55,730 --> 00:50:00,884
...<i>Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House</i>,
<i>Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer</i>...

832
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:05,601
...and these were gigantic hits,
and everybody responded to them.

833
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,646
- I hope you like basketball.
- Crazy about it.

834
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:13,564
I wrote a script called
<i>The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer</i>.

835
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:15,800
I got an Oscar
for that original screenplay.

836
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:21,488
And I'm convinced that I got it
because of Cary.

837
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,288
Because it was a comedy...

838
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:27,523
...and comedies usually aren't paid
that much attention to by critics.

839
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:32,929
<i>Now in his mid-40s, Grant is keenly</i>
<i>aware of taking age-appropriate roles.</i>

840
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:39,438
<i>Home, fatherhood and daily life lead to</i>
<i>a spate of uninspired, yet popular films.</i>

841
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:44,010
There must be a girl who thinks
it a wonderful career...

842
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:46,730
...to have a home and babies
and make her husband happy.

843
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:49,882
There are a lot of crude movies
in that period after <i>Notorious</i>...

844
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:53,759
...where it's just kind of Cary Grant
trading on the audience goodwill...

845
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:56,728
...the fact that people would go
see him in these movies.

846
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:59,165
And movies were getting
more interesting.

847
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:02,561
<i>Marlon Brando, Elia Kazan</i>
<i>and James Dean are among those...</i>

848
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:07,440
<i>... leading a generation of actors</i>
<i>and directors into new territory.</i>

849
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:11,808
I offended him because I had seen him
in a picture called <i>The Bishop 's Wife</i>...

850
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:16,919
...and I said to him,
"You are in a position now...

851
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:20,924
...where you can choose
the most wonderful movies.

852
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:22,961
Why are you doing this?"

853
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:26,486
He never answered because
he was deeply offended...

854
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:29,079
...and I learned to keep
my mouth shut.

855
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:32,799
<i>Grant, reunited with director</i>
<i>Howard Hawks, cannot overcome...</i>

856
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:37,361
<i>... the dated fountain-of-youth premise</i>
<i>of 1952's</i> Monkey Business.

857
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:40,489
- All set?
- Is your motor running?

858
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:42,129
Is yours?

859
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:45,282
- Here you are, doctor.
- Oh, thank you. Just mail me the bill.

860
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:47,520
- Certainly.
- Takes a while to warm up.

861
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,203
Does me too.

862
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:53,249
Well, watch your head,
I'll watch everything else.

863
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:56,527
He's basically still doing movies
that you could've done in the '20s.

864
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:59,887
These could've been silent two-reeler
movies, like <i>Monkey Business</i>...

865
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,369
...or <i>I Was A Male War Bride</i>.

866
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:06,679
Hey, did you hear that?
I must look pretty good.

867
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:08,806
- Don't be silly, that was for me.
- For you?

868
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:11,040
- Of course.
- I ought to punch him in the nose.

869
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:12,723
Remember, you're a lady.

870
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:18,248
He comes from an era in which
acting was a way to make a living...

871
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:21,920
...as opposed to being a way
to express your inner demons.

872
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:25,327
It was a way to feed yourself,
a way to feed your family...

873
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:27,248
...to keep the wolf from the door.

874
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:31,449
But that's also why he's so easy
to take over a long period of time...

875
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:35,489
...because even though he had
fabulous qualities as an actor...

876
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:39,563
...he didn't wanna squeeze the audience.
He doesn't wanna push you.

877
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:43,524
It's his job to do something that's fun,
not to change your life.

878
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,361
He was the commodity.

879
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:51,086
If you wanted to be happy,
you saw a Cary Grant movie.

880
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:55,608
And Cary Grant is asked to join
the screen's immortals...

881
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:58,364
...invited, that is, to make his imprint
in the cement...

882
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:00,919
...of Grauman's Chinese Theatre
in Hollywood.

883
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:05,922
<i>No matter what the critical response,</i>
<i>Grant's films during this period...</i>

884
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:08,200
<i>... never lose money at the box office.</i>

885
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:10,844
Holiday season crowds line
up around the block...

886
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:14,525
...for the world premiere of the Radio
City Music Hall's Christmas Show...

887
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:17,568
...UI's new release,
<i>Operation Petticoat</i>.

888
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:21,319
His most popular movie, and of his
career, was <i>Operation Petticoat</i>...

889
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:26,405
...which was basically a family
service comedy, slightly risqué.

890
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:29,204
Russell B. Downing,
president of the Music Hall...

891
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:32,999
...presents an illuminated scroll, honoring
Grant as the famed New York...

892
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:36,526
...show place's all-time favorite
movie star and box-office champion.

893
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:39,767
He didn't distinguish between
those pictures that were terrible...

894
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:42,239
...like <i>Operation Petticoat</i>
or <i>Walk, Don 't Run</i>.

895
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:45,766
Those were pictures to him that were
good because audiences went to them.

896
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:49,280
A good movie to Cary Grant
was a movie that made money.

897
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:53,921
<i>Cary Grant's interest in money, whether</i>
<i>in the workplace or in his personal life...</i>

898
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:57,446
<i>... had been a favorite</i>
<i>Hollywood topic for years.</i>

899
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:59,368
I remember walking down the street...

900
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:02,727
...with Cary Grant near Mt. Rushmore...

901
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:07,725
...and people asking him for his
autograph, and he charged 25 cents.

902
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:11,883
And I thought, "I don't do that.
Maybe I should."

903
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,606
He watched every penny...

904
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:19,605
...and I think it was rooted
in his childhood.

905
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:23,041
If you were lower class,
you were nothing.

906
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:26,762
And he was... He was not
about to be nothing.

907
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:31,599
Irving Reis, who directed
<i>The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer...</i>

908
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:36,161
...died and left a very young widow
and two little children.

909
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:39,965
Cary, who wasn't particularly
friendly with Irving...

910
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:44,169
...gave Vanessa, his widow, $ 10,000.

911
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:46,486
I said, "I understand you gave
her some money."

912
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,289
He knew I was alluding to the fact
that people said...

913
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:53,602
...he didn't like spending money.
He said, "I like to pick my spots."

914
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:57,966
<i>Though he is no longer as eager</i>
<i>to take chances professionally...</i>

915
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:00,690
<i>... Grant's personal life is another matter.</i>

916
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:07,006
Why don't you tell me all about yourself?
Things you've never told anyone else.

917
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:10,805
I met Cary onboard the <i>Queen Mary</i>.
It was absolutely marvelous.

918
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:13,968
When I left the <i>Queen Mary</i>,
I didn't think I'd see him again.

919
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:15,848
<i>Twenty years his junior</i>...

920
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:20,686
...<i>actress Betsy Drake had just finished</i>
<i>a successful stage run in London.</i>

921
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:24,326
But when I left the ship, I didn't give
him my telephone number.

922
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:28,483
He didn't know my telephone number.
He had to track me down.

923
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:33,969
<i>Endlessly pursued by Grant, Drake soon</i>
<i>came out to Los Angeles to join him.</i>

924
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:37,441
<i>Having broken her first contract</i>
<i>with producer Hal Wallace...</i>

925
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:42,809
<i>... Drake signed with RKO and was cast</i>
<i>opposite Grant in her first film role.</i>

926
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,766
How many have you?

927
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:48,323
Beg your pardon?

928
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:52,005
These. How many have you?

929
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:54,968
- Why, none, fortunately.
- Fortunately?

930
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:57,007
I'm not married.

931
00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:01,163
We eloped so that there wouldn't
be anybody bothering us.

932
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:04,362
<i>However, married life took</i>
<i>Drake by surprise.</i>

933
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:08,603
He came from the first part
of the 20th century.

934
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:11,563
Wives were expected
to behave a certain way.

935
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:16,758
And Cary swallowed my life.
I lost myself...

936
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:20,123
...in trying to please him.

937
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:24,489
Don't you find, by accepting
this interesting challenge...

938
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:28,040
...you're apt to neglect your husband?
- In what way?

939
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:31,361
How many ways are there?

940
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:32,804
Well, I assure you...

941
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:36,326
...that whatever inconvenience
he has been caused is temporary.

942
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:39,169
What I didn't know and
what I learned later, really...

943
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:41,764
...was that Cary was tired of being
a sex symbol.

944
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:46,282
He wanted to play a father,
and change his entire image...

945
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:50,045
...and also this was a chance for him
to make a picture with Betsy.

946
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:53,646
<i>But after two films with Drake,</i>
<i>Grant's interest in fatherhood...</i>

947
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:56,324
<i>... remained firmly on the screen.</i>

948
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:59,527
Cary knew from the very beginning
I wanted children.

949
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:03,842
He refused and said, "I want to travel.
There's so much I want to do.

950
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:06,524
I really don't want a child."

951
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:10,808
<i>The exception for Grant</i>
<i>was Barbara Hutton 's son, Lance.</i>

952
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:14,087
We visited him. He was living
with his governess...

953
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:19,563
...and a dog on a ranch,
ghost ranch in New Mexico.

954
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:25,206
I made an 8-mm movie
with Lance and Cary...

955
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:27,440
...called <i>The Killer of Fossil Gulch</i>.

956
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:32,566
<i>The bond between the two had only</i>
<i>grown stronger through the years.</i>

957
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:37,929
In it, Cary was shot by Lance,
and he did it so wonderfully.

958
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:41,048
So I kept in both shots when I cut it.

959
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:43,246
He wanted parents.

960
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:49,565
And I was devoted to him,
and I know Cary was.

961
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:56,124
<i>Tragically, Lance would die in a plane</i>
<i>crash in 1972 at the age of 36.</i>

962
00:57:57,290 --> 00:58:01,329
<i>It had been six years since</i>
<i>the artistic triumph of</i> Notorious.

963
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:04,846
<i>During this time, for reasons</i>
<i>that still remain a mystery...</i>

964
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:10,801
<i>... Grant turns down choice projects,</i>
<i>such as</i> Roman Holiday <i>and</i> Sabrina.

965
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:15,998
<i>His uncompromising professionalism even</i>
<i>keeps him away from</i> A Star Is Born...

966
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:19,560
<i>... directed by long-time friend</i>
<i>George Cukor.</i>

967
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:22,324
Judy wooed us.

968
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:26,165
She was so desperate,
but she kept after Cary.

969
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:31,245
But Cary did not want to do it because
Judy Garland was a drug addict...

970
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:35,449
...and Cary was a highly
disciplined actor...

971
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:40,684
...and expected you to show up on time
and know your lines.

972
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:44,525
And he didn't want to go
through the experience.

973
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:47,528
<i>Instead, Grant and Drake</i>
<i>leave Hollywood...</i>

974
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,807
<i>... fueling rumors that he</i>
<i>had decided to retire.</i>

975
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:56,368
He never spoke to me about retiring.
No, Cary loved to travel.

976
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:58,521
<i>The couple board a freighter for Asia...</i>

977
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:02,968
<i>... stopping to visit Gls wounded</i>
<i>in the Korean War.</i>

978
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:08,085
It was only because Hitchcock...

979
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:12,482
...asked for him specifically, and sent
him that great script, <i>To Catch a Thief</i>...

980
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:17,041
...that he did come back. The studio had
wanted Jimmy Stewart.

981
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:20,486
But Hitchcock said, "No, I want Cary."
And they got him.

982
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:23,369
<i>He returns to work with the director,</i>
<i>who guaranteed...</i>

983
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:27,728
<i>... both Grace Kelly and the</i>
<i>French Riviera as his co-stars.</i>

984
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:32,247
One of the movies that really illustrates
that everything has come together...

985
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:34,401
...perfectly for Grant
is <i>To Catch a Thief</i>.

986
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:38,199
Here's Hitchcock at his
light-entertainment best.

987
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:44,685
Here's the exquisitely beautiful Grace
Kelly at the peak of her gorgeousness...

988
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:49,839
...and Cary Grant playing a cat burglar,
and it's just light.

989
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:52,120
We don't have too much
of a mental challenge.

990
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:54,520
We're just going to have fun.

991
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:56,527
You got an opener?

992
00:59:56,690 --> 01:00:00,603
- You want a leg or a breast?
- You make the choice.

993
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:03,244
In private life, he was
a totally unsophisticated man.

994
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:05,446
He didn't know zilch about wines.

995
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:10,126
He didn't go to parties very much,
and his idea of a great meal...

996
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:13,168
...was sausage and mash
at an English pub.

997
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:15,400
So there was this great schism...

998
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,880
...between the person we saw
and imagined him to be...

999
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:22,838
...a guy in a tuxedo drinking
a martini, and the real Cary.

1000
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:27,125
You know as well as I do,
this necklace is imitation.

1001
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:30,001
Well, I'm not.

1002
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:37,166
<i>The film is a huge hit and</i>
<i>Grant leaves suburbia behind...</i>

1003
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:42,085
<i>... and returns to the suave rake</i>
<i>the public has come to love.</i>

1004
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:46,084
Here at 20th Century Fox Studio,
Cary Grant, Deborah Kerr...

1005
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:49,401
...and director Leo McCarey
discuss their newest production:

1006
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:51,128
<i>An Affair To Remember.</i>

1007
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:54,966
<i>An Affair To Remember</i>
is an awfully powerful story.

1008
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:58,122
The original picture is overall
a better picture.

1009
01:00:58,290 --> 01:01:03,080
McCarey always thought it was a better
picture, but the plot is pretty irresistible.

1010
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:08,245
<i>Half comedy, half tragedy, the story</i>
<i>of ill-fated lovers is practically...</i>

1011
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:13,484
<i>... a shot-by-shot remake of director</i>
<i>Leo McCarey's own 1939</i> Love Affair.

1012
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:15,561
I have a telephone call
for you from Paris.

1013
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:18,198
Mr. Ferrante, would you autograph
this for us?

1014
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:23,439
I hadn't seen one attractive woman
on this ship since we left. I was alarmed.

1015
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:26,204
I said to myself, "Don't beautiful
women travel anymore?"

1016
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:30,727
And then I saw you.
And I was saved, I hope.

1017
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:37,968
Tell me. Have you been getting
results with a line like that?

1018
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:42,888
Even when he was having fun
and laughing and making jokes...

1019
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:44,369
...at which he was excellent.

1020
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:46,441
Order the bouillabaisse. It's superb.

1021
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:49,038
Oh, shut up.

1022
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:54,159
There was still this remoteness. There
was still this keeping something a secret.

1023
01:01:55,450 --> 01:02:00,444
<i>At the film 's climax, a stoic Grant</i>
<i>discovers Kerr missed their rendezvous...</i>

1024
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:03,044
<i>... because of a terrible accident.</i>

1025
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:07,119
Cary was a devout believer
in keeping to...

1026
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:10,839
...and following the kind of image
that you have built up.

1027
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:13,405
He always kept...

1028
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:14,969
...Cary Grant.

1029
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:17,201
Why didn't you tell me?

1030
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:21,807
If it had to happen to one of us,
why did it have to be you?

1031
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:29,209
There was a most unexpected
vulnerability in Cary.

1032
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:32,402
If I said fear,
that wouldn't be right...

1033
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:36,609
...but he was wary of relationships
with women.

1034
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:41,522
<i>Betsy Drake had now been married</i>
<i>to Grant for seven years.</i>

1035
01:02:41,890 --> 01:02:45,166
<i>During that time she had shown</i>
<i>considerable talent as a writer.</i>

1036
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:47,844
<i>And after working</i>
<i>on several radio programs...</i>

1037
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:51,241
<i>... Drake completed</i>
<i>the screenplay to</i> Houseboat.

1038
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:53,321
<i>Grant took the project</i>
<i>to Paramount...</i>

1039
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:56,209
<i>... as a third vehicle</i>
<i>for the couple to star in...</i>

1040
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:59,760
<i>... hoping to lock down a director</i>
<i>before leaving for his next film.</i>

1041
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:02,205
I said, "Where are you going?"
He said, "To Spain.

1042
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:04,930
I'm making a picture called
<i>The Pride and the Passion...</i>

1043
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:07,320
...with Frank Sinatra
and some new Italian girl."

1044
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:09,889
<i>Grant arrives in Spain...</i>

1045
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:14,760
<i>... and quickly begins an affair</i>
<i>with a 23-year-old Sophia Loren.</i>

1046
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:19,446
I asked him about Sophia and him
on <i>The Pride and the Passion.</i>

1047
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:22,528
He says, "Yeah, well, we tore up
a few bullrings in Spain."

1048
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:26,723
That was evidently
a very dynamic affair.

1049
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:30,127
He was crazy about her. I think she
was a bit "the girl that got away."

1050
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:34,047
I got a call from Cary.
He says, "I just met the new Garbo.

1051
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:38,044
Would it be much to change the heroine
of your story to an Italian girl?"

1052
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:40,678
And we tore up the script
when he hung up the phone.

1053
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,408
There was no way that would work.

1054
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:48,010
<i>Drake was told nothing as both script</i>
<i>and cast were altered at Grant's request.</i>

1055
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:50,684
If I had any sense...

1056
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:55,207
...I would've realized how much
Cary didn't love me.

1057
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:56,689
He didn't.

1058
01:03:56,930 --> 01:03:58,648
Betsy never complained
about anything.

1059
01:03:58,810 --> 01:04:02,485
She never asked for a credit because
we had changed her story so much.

1060
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:05,927
<i>Meanwhile, Grant's affair</i>
<i>with Loren came to a bitter end...</i>

1061
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:08,479
<i>... before shooting in Spain was over.</i>

1062
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:12,962
<i>Now contractually obligated to co-star</i>
<i>in the reworked</i> Houseboat...

1063
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:15,849
<i>... Grant tried to back out</i>
<i>of the film altogether.</i>

1064
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:19,088
Before the picture started,
I held a peace conference.

1065
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:22,083
Basically, I said, you know,
"I know what your problems are.

1066
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:26,004
I know what's been going on."
Cary agreed to go through with the film.

1067
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:30,129
Feeling that if he did, he might have
a chance at getting back with Sophia.

1068
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:33,919
He tried and the only way she finally got
rid of him was to marry Carlo Ponti.

1069
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:36,718
- Shake her.
- You scared?

1070
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:38,801
- Yes, I'm scared.
- Chicken.

1071
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:41,080
In one scene, he was supposed
to be dancing...

1072
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,842
...with Sophia in the nightclub.

1073
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:47,762
What came through for me
was the battle that was going on...

1074
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:49,841
...between the two of them
at that moment.

1075
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:54,128
But it didn't matter because
the audience interpreted it as love.

1076
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,440
It was very, very tough
on the picture...

1077
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:59,608
...because of the relationship
between the two of them.

1078
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,362
It created a lot of tension.

1079
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:05,882
By the time the picture finished,
he had me in the hospital. I had an ulcer.

1080
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:09,805
When he heard that Sophia Loren
was gonna write her autobiography...

1081
01:05:09,970 --> 01:05:11,961
...he begged her
not to mention him.

1082
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:16,322
And, of course, she did mention him,
and that was the end of that friendship.

1083
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:20,448
When he told me, it was a big shock.

1084
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:26,287
If I'd had any self-respect, I would've...
I don't know, kicked him in the teeth...

1085
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:29,681
...and walked out. But I didn't.

1086
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:33,889
<i>Surprisingly, the couple stay together</i>
<i>as Grant begins production...</i>

1087
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:37,804
<i>... on what is arguably</i>
<i>the highlight of his screen career.</i>

1088
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:55,079
You didn't have to introduce
that character at length.

1089
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:57,406
Bingo. You knew who he was.

1090
01:05:57,570 --> 01:06:00,368
You were on his side,
and you took the trip with him.

1091
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:03,078
There was no rehearsal.

1092
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:05,764
This is Cary Grant.
You're gonna fall in love with him.

1093
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:09,718
This is Eva Marie. You're gonna fall
in love with her. And you start.

1094
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:14,209
The adventure and the suspense
was very important to him.

1095
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:16,207
I wanted to do the Hitchcock picture...

1096
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:19,522
...to end all Hitchcock pictures.

1097
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:24,241
We think of that film as a journey
from New York City across country...

1098
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:27,482
...ending up in South Dakota
at Mount Rushmore.

1099
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:32,605
It's actually a journey through
Cary Grant's various persona aspects...

1100
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:36,285
...and of all the career things
that he's done over the years.

1101
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:39,163
<i>A seamless blend of romance,</i>
<i>comedy and suspense...</i>

1102
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:44,040
...North By Northwest <i>begins</i>
<i>production on August 26, 1958.</i>

1103
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:47,162
The beauty of the plot is that,
even though it's absurd...

1104
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:49,048
...you're completely caught up in it.

1105
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:54,445
You don't need a rich
script development.

1106
01:06:54,650 --> 01:07:00,998
The door opens. It's Cary Grant, and
everybody knows who and what that is.

1107
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:05,086
Hitchcock loved to put people
who seemed to be in such control...

1108
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:09,323
...of their lives and themselves in
the beginning, and then it all falls apart.

1109
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:10,764
We're in jeopardy.

1110
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:13,962
Because people in the audience think,
"He's got it made.

1111
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:17,645
He doesn't have it made," you know.
"He's being kidnapped."

1112
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:21,326
Hey, wait a minute.
What's that supposed to be?

1113
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:24,368
The car's waiting outside.
You'll walk between us. Say nothing.

1114
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:26,606
Hitch thought the whole thing
was a comedy.

1115
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:30,843
Essentially, he says, "Why,
the whole thing's a fantasy, I mean...

1116
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:34,685
...there's not even any such
thing as north by northwest."

1117
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:37,848
- What is this, a joke or something?
- Yes, a joke.

1118
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:39,807
- We will laugh in the car.
- Come.

1119
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:42,723
He was a wonderful light comedian.

1120
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:46,041
And he was funny as hell
in <i>North By Northwest.</i>

1121
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:49,409
Not that I mind a slight case
of abduction now and then...

1122
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:51,481
...but I have tickets
for the theater.

1123
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:56,241
To a show I was looking forward to. And
I get unreasonable about things like that.

1124
01:07:56,450 --> 01:08:00,238
With such expert play-acting,
you make this very room a theater.

1125
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:08,320
<i>For their final film together,</i>
<i>director and star are perfectly in sync.</i>

1126
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:11,562
I think they were both jealous
of each other a little bit.

1127
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:15,279
I mean, Hitch could never
be Cary Grant...

1128
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:20,888
...and Cary could never do what
Hitch had done with his great career.

1129
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:24,322
They were two very big stars.

1130
01:08:24,490 --> 01:08:28,768
Cary had an apartment at the Plaza
in New York City...

1131
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:32,286
...so the scene where
he walks across the lobby...

1132
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:34,964
...he just walked across.
He didn't have any direction.

1133
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:38,440
Hitchcock said, "Why should
I direct him? He's done this.

1134
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:41,488
He has an apartment upstairs."

1135
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:45,287
Cary said to me, "I was like a baby.
I could fold myself up...

1136
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:48,328
...as if I was in the fetal position.
And whatever he said...

1137
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:50,481
...I would do,
and he was always right."

1138
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:57,603
<i>Grant's trust in his director led to one of</i>
<i>the most iconic scenes in American film.</i>

1139
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:01,525
There's a scene where Cary Grant
is sent out into the countryside.

1140
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:05,002
Now, you know, it's a setup
for him to be shot.

1141
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:08,720
Cary Grant gets out of a bus
and stands there.

1142
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:10,409
And the audience is saying:

1143
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:13,528
"Well, it's perfectly normal.
What can happen here?"

1144
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:23,328
Part of the wonderful amusement
of the famous crop-dusting sequence...

1145
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:27,364
...is how perfectly he's dressed,
and who he is.

1146
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:29,282
He's Cary Grant being attacked...

1147
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:32,408
...by an airplane, throwing
himself into cornstalks.

1148
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:35,846
If it were any other actor, it would've
just been a physical menace.

1149
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:38,808
It wouldn't be so acutely funny.

1150
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:42,519
I don't know exactly how I came...

1151
01:09:42,690 --> 01:09:46,205
...to make a hospital room
scene almost comedy.

1152
01:09:49,330 --> 01:09:52,242
- Stop!
- Oh, excuse me, I...

1153
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:54,446
Stop.

1154
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:58,607
We even have a moment
that addresses the charm...

1155
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:00,761
...the lure of the real Cary Grant.

1156
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:03,399
Has anyone ever told you
that you overplay...

1157
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:05,925
...your various roles
rather severely, Mr. Kaplan?

1158
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:09,884
Apparently the only performance
that'll satisfy you is when I play dead.

1159
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:11,644
Cary worried.

1160
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:14,608
He was a worrier,
and he worked at what he did.

1161
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:17,648
And he worked hard.
I was very impressed...

1162
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:22,162
...with how prepared he was
and how disciplined he was.

1163
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:26,522
He set such a high standard. He was the
first one there. The last one to leave.

1164
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:29,124
Knew his lines. Expected everybody...

1165
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:32,999
...crew, all of us,
to be right on the button.

1166
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:35,280
I've got you! Up!

1167
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:37,486
- I can't make it!
- Yes, you can.

1168
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:42,246
<i>As film critic Pauline Kael wrote:</i>

1169
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:48,360
<i>"He was cast as Cary Grant and he</i>
<i>gave a performance as Cary Grant. "</i>

1170
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:53,846
Every time I ran into him he'd say:

1171
01:10:54,010 --> 01:10:57,525
"You know, all the films I've done
and all the films you've done, Martin...

1172
01:10:57,690 --> 01:11:00,045
...we did something right
with that one."

1173
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:05,125
For some reason, that picture struck a
chord more than anything I've ever done.

1174
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:06,609
People bring that picture up.

1175
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:09,569
We did something right.

1176
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:15,209
Our marriage had broken up,
but we were still living together.

1177
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:21,883
I have tried yoga. I've tried God.
Nothing worked.

1178
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:25,520
I told this one friend
the despair I was in...

1179
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:28,807
...and she said,
"Well, you should try LSD."

1180
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:33,401
And it was completely legal,
and it was extraordinary.

1181
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:36,038
Absolutely amazing.

1182
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:39,964
<i>The drug is administered as an</i>
<i>alternative to traditional therapy...</i>

<i>for less than therapeutic reasons.</i>

1185
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:53,848
He went in to find out,
from Mor Hartmann, what I was saying.

1186
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:58,680
He didn't think he had to find himself.
He'd found himself, for God sakes.

1187
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:02,648
He didn't think he was lost.

1188
01:12:03,130 --> 01:12:05,439
<i>Grant is convinced to try</i>
<i>the drug as well...</i>

1189
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:07,919

1191
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:18,362
"I was hiding behind all kinds of
defenses, hypocrisies and vanities.

1192
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:20,964
I had to get rid of them
layer by layer.

1193
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:23,769
That moment when your conscious
meets your subconscious...

1194
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:26,125
...is a hell of a wrench."

1195
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:28,600
And I said, "I'm leaving you today."

1196
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:32,558
And he said, "You can't do that.
I'm making a movie."

1197
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:34,721
And I said, "I'm leaving you."

1198
01:12:34,930 --> 01:12:40,687
<i>After numerous separations,</i>
<i>the couple finally divorced in 1962.</i>

1199
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:45,083
"After three unsuccessful marriages,
either something was wrong with me...

1200
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:46,729
...or civilization.

1201
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:49,120
I'm not proud of my marriage record.

1202
01:12:49,290 --> 01:12:52,885
It was not the fault of Hollywood,
but my own inadequacies...

1203
01:12:53,050 --> 01:12:55,359
...and my mistrust of constancy."

1204
01:12:56,210 --> 01:13:00,203
<i>The following year, Grant was at</i>
<i>a crossroads over his next project.</i>

1205
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:02,440
Peter Stone and I worked on a script...

1206
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:06,689
...and I sent it to Cary.
And he turned us down.

1207
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:08,761
He said no. And I was sick.

1208
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:13,208
I said, "Why?" And he said he was
doing a picture with Howard Hawks.

1209
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:17,283
<i>Man 's Favorite Sport?</i>
There was a lot of young women in it...

1210
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:18,849
...and Cary backed out.

1211
01:13:19,210 --> 01:13:23,203
Hawks said, "Well, every time I see you,
you've got a younger girl on your arm."

1212
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:27,045
Cary said, "That's different." He doesn't
wanna be seen that way in the movie.

1213
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:31,518
We had breakfast, and he said,
"Is that script still available?"

1214
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:35,729
And I said yes. And he said, "Well,
if you still want me, I'd like to do it."

1215
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:39,360
And I said, "Yes, definitely,
I still want you."

1216
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:55,159
- What are you doing?
- I'm having a nervous breakdown.

1217
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:58,089
<i>Well into his third decade</i>

<i>Hepburn, who is 25 years his junior.</i>

1219
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:06,167
<i>He makes only one request</i>
<i>before shooting begins.</i>

1220
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:12,087
One thing he said, "I'm a bit old to be
chasing a girl. Let's let her chase me."

1221
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:18,923
- Reggie?
- Got you!

1222
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:22,642
Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn
are walking along the Seine...

1223
01:14:23,010 --> 01:14:24,807
...and she has an ice cream cone.

1224
01:14:26,570 --> 01:14:29,243
You know, this is good. Want some?

1225
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:32,248
No, thank you.

1226
01:14:32,450 --> 01:14:34,964
That's all. Perfect.

1227
01:14:35,130 --> 01:14:36,404
Unruffable.

1228
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:38,966
We took all the chances.

1229
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:41,485
The money belongs to us,
not to him.

1230
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:43,567
Now, don't be piggy, Herman.

1231
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:45,527
He would say, "Always remember...

1232
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:49,361
...that you are a product."

1233
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:54,485
He said, "A Cary Grant cannot
do this, this, this and this.

1234
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:56,083
A Cary Grant must do that."

1235
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:58,480
He talked about himself
in the third person.

1236
01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:02,529
And I said, "That's fabulous
to be able to differentiate...

1237
01:15:02,690 --> 01:15:06,239
...the real guy from
this image he's created."

1238
01:15:06,450 --> 01:15:10,204
- Do you know what's wrong with you?
- No, what?

1239
01:15:10,730 --> 01:15:12,209
Nothing.

1240
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:15,642
He's not even a person anymore.
He's this godlike figure.

1241
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:20,048
You know?
He's sheer mythology in <i>Charade.</i>

1242
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:23,247
Well, when you come on,
you come on, don't you?

1243
01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:25,480
Well, come on.

1244
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:34,919
<i>In the early '60s, Grant sees 23-year-old</i>
<i>Dyan Cannon on television...</i>

1245
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:36,364
<i>... and contacts her.</i>

1246
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:40,205
<i>The two begin dating</i>
<i>and marry in early 1965.</i>

1247
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:42,600
When Cary married Dyan Cannon...

1248
01:15:42,770 --> 01:15:47,082
...I thought that was the oddest couple
I'd ever even thought of. You know?

1249
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:49,844
Never would've thought
he would've been attracted to her.

1250
01:15:50,330 --> 01:15:54,084
Cary did anything that she seemed
to want to please her.

1251
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:57,526
I felt he was more in love with her
than the other way around.

1252
01:15:57,730 --> 01:16:00,802
<i>In direct contrast to his home life,</i>
<i>Grant is shrewd enough...</i>

1253
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:04,565
<i>... to realize he can no longer continue</i>
<i>as a romantic leading man.</i>

1254
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:09,480
<i>In 1965 he leaves for Japan</i>
<i>to star in his final film.</i>

1255
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:13,644
I came about sharing the apartment.
How do you do?

1256
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:16,324
- How do you do?
- This card was on the bulletin board...

1257
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:18,208
...at the embassy.
- But you're a man.

1258
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:20,409
Yes, I suppose so.

1259
01:16:20,570 --> 01:16:22,720
I prefer sharing an apartment
with a woman.

1260
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:24,118
Well, so do I.

1261
01:16:25,730 --> 01:16:29,120
What was brilliant about Cary was that
in working in such close quarters...

1262
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:30,769
Every set was very, very small.

1263
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:34,127
- Save you the bother of transferring
your things from the other room.

1264
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:40,240
Us youngsters watched him,
followed him and got into...

1265
01:16:40,410 --> 01:16:44,767
...his brilliant comedic timing
and his examples...

1266
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:49,128
...literally by being with him
and watching him.

1267
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:57,278
Given the persona he has,
there is no future for it as he ages.

1268
01:16:57,490 --> 01:17:02,006
Instead of turning into
the Charles Coburn, old father figure...

1269
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:04,559
...he gave us Cary Grant. Perfect.

1270
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:08,040
He wrapped him up and left him
where we needed him to be...

1271
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:09,768
...and where he needed him to be.

1272
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:13,282
Let's face it. This was
an illusion that he created...

1273
01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:17,602
...and Cary wasn't gonna wreck that.
That was his life's work, really.

1274
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:20,409
So, at a certain point, he said,
"It's time to quit."

1275
01:17:20,610 --> 01:17:24,205
<i>After 72 films, Grant walks away...</i>

1276
01:17:24,370 --> 01:17:27,043
<i>... ending his career</i>
<i>with no announcement.</i>

1277
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:30,566
"You can never go back.
It's not possible.

1278
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:34,245
I could make another film,
but I'd be playing a different man.

1279
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:37,880
It would've been a great
disappointment for an audience to see."

1280
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:42,359
We were going to the first
AFI Lifetime Achievement Award.

1281
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:44,919
It was for John Ford,
and we came up to this table...

1282
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:48,321
...where you had to hand in your ticket,
and Cary walks up and says:

1283
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:51,402
"I'm terribly sorry. I forgot
my ticket. May I get in, please?"

1284
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:54,084
And the woman doesn't look up.
She says, "Name?"

1285
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:55,569
And he says, "Cary Grant."

1286
01:17:55,730 --> 01:17:59,325
Now she looks up at him, and she says,
"You don't look like Cary Grant."

1287
01:17:59,490 --> 01:18:01,640
He says, "I know. Nobody does."

1288
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:07,449
He was right. Nobody did look like
Cary Grant, including him. You couldn't.

1289
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:11,921
<i>Grant turns all his attention</i>
<i>to his latest project.</i>

1290
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:17,449
<i>At the age of 62, he becomes a father</i>
<i>with the birth of his daughter, Jennifer.</i>

1291
01:18:17,650 --> 01:18:20,084
He, I think, had wanted
to have children beforehand...

1292
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:22,206
...but for one reason or another had not.

1293
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:24,560
Part of it, he said,
was his own selfishness.

1294
01:18:24,730 --> 01:18:28,200
He was too involved
in his own career.

1295
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:32,005
That changed him a great deal,
much more than his wives did.

1296
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:37,721
Well, I think he discovered paternal love,
which he had never known about.

1297
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:40,440
And it was a surprise to him.

1298
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:46,044
<i>The disparity in age between Grant</i>
<i>and Cannon lead to mounting problems.</i>

1299
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:49,327
She was a spirited woman,
and she didn't want to put up...

1300
01:18:49,490 --> 01:18:53,403
...with Cary's slightly
autocratic way of talking.

1301
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:55,642
He didn't like women to wear makeup.

1302
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:59,203
And she would put makeup on,
and he'd tell her to take it off.

1303
01:18:59,490 --> 01:19:01,082
And she just got fed up with it.

1304
01:19:01,290 --> 01:19:04,600
<i>Although overjoyed with Jennifer,</i>
<i>the couple reach a breaking point...</i>

1305
01:19:04,770 --> 01:19:06,840
<i>... and Cannon moves out.</i>

1306
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:10,047
<i>Grant had made an art of keeping</i>
<i>his private life closely guarded.</i>

1307
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:14,761
<i>But in 1968, he's thrown</i>
<i>into a highly public divorce.</i>

1308
01:19:14,970 --> 01:19:19,725
<i>While Cannon levels accusations</i>
<i>to the press, Grant refuses to respond.</i>

1309
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:24,162
After Dyan and he divorced,
his time with Jennifer was very limited...

1310
01:19:24,330 --> 01:19:28,209
...and obviously, at the back of his mind,
was also his time was probably limited...

1311
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:31,089
...because of his age. So he wanted
to spend as much time...

1312
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:32,763
...as he possibly could with her.

1313
01:19:33,450 --> 01:19:37,443
<i>That same year, Grant is appointed</i>
<i>to the board of directors of Fabergé...</i>

1314
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:41,967
<i>... the perfume and cosmetics company,</i>
<i>in a move that surprises many.</i>

1315
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:46,721
That was a very interesting arrangement
because he wasn't interested in money.

1316
01:19:46,930 --> 01:19:51,082
By then Dyan Cannon was traveling
around the country filming...

1317
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:55,038
...and Cary wanted a private plane at his
disposal so he could drop everything...

1318
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:57,440
...and at a moment's notice,
get on that plane...

1319
01:19:57,610 --> 01:20:01,046
...and go wherever he had
to go to be with Jennifer.

1320
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:13,241
<i>In 1970, Grant is thrilled to learn that</i>
<i>the Academy has chosen to award him...</i>

1321
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:18,040
<i>... for what they term "his unique</i>
<i>mastery of the art of screen acting. "</i>

1322
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:21,282
<i>He is deeply moved by</i>
<i>the audience's reaction.</i>

1323
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:26,960
Well, I want to thank you very much
for signifying your approval of this.

1324
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:29,485
I shall cherish it until I die.

1325
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:34,087
Because probably no greater honor
can come to any man...

1326
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:37,048
...than the respect of his colleagues.
Thank you. So long.

1327
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:39,599
<i>Keeping public appearances</i>
<i>to a minimum...</i>

1328
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:44,201
<i>... Grant has a knack for combining</i>
<i>business with personal interests.</i>

1329
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:49,239
<i>He joins the boards of other corporations</i>
<i>including MGM and Hollywood Park.</i>

1330
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:53,119
When I got to know Cary, he was
the youngest 80-year-old I ever met.

1331
01:20:53,290 --> 01:20:56,726
We were sitting at the track, and he
said, "Would you like to take a walk?"

1332
01:20:56,890 --> 01:20:59,688
He had the coolest, youngest walk
and so sprightly.

1333
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:03,479
It inspired me to say, "Remember what
you just saw because it was really great."

1334
01:21:04,090 --> 01:21:08,242
<i>Despite his age, Grant still</i>
<i>travels the world for Fabergé.</i>

1335
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:10,605
Fabergé had a trade show
in London every year...

1336
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:12,806
...and it was at
the Royal Lancaster Hotel.

1337
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:15,928
I did the public relations
at the Royal Lancaster Hotel.

1338
01:21:16,130 --> 01:21:20,646
<i>Forty-seven years younger, Barbara</i>
<i>marries Grant after a two-year courtship.</i>

1339
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:23,569
I never, ever envisaged having
any form of a relationship...

1340
01:21:23,730 --> 01:21:25,322
...other than friendship with him.

1341
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:28,323
But because he was such
an extraordinary individual...

1342
01:21:28,490 --> 01:21:31,926
...regardless of his age,
I couldn't help myself.

1343
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:34,644
I couldn't stop from falling
in love with him.

1344
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:40,123
And even though I knew that that time
together would probably be limited...

1345
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:43,527
...the quality of it was extraordinarily
important to me...

1346
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:46,363
...and I wouldn't have
changed it for the world.

1347
01:21:46,570 --> 01:21:48,367
It was just a beautiful thing to see...

1348
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:52,239
...how much Barbara and Cary
loved each other. How at peace...

1349
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:56,483
...how comfortable, how happy
they were. They got it right.

1350
01:21:56,650 --> 01:22:02,919
<i>Retired now for over a decade, Grant's</i>
<i>personal life still continues to fascinate.</i>

1351
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:08,887
Chevy Chase on a television show
made a crack that Cary was a homo.

1352
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:12,963
It was a stupid moment for Chevy,
and he regretted it.

1353
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:14,398
Cary was annoyed.

1354
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:18,803
He was more concerned of how
Jennifer would feel about it...

1355
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:20,688
...and also how
I would feel about it.

1356
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:25,810
He did sue Chevy,
and then they settled out of court.

1357
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:28,649
<i>Grant has finally found</i>
<i>happiness at home.</i>

1358
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:31,608
<i>The offers of awards and tributes</i>
<i>begin in earnest.</i>

1359
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:34,603
<i>But unlike his peers,</i>
<i>he refuses them all.</i>

1360
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:37,807
Cary hated getting up
and making a public speech.

1361
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:40,808
And it wasn't worth the trouble
for him to go to something...

1362
01:22:40,970 --> 01:22:43,404
...where he was meant
to be awarded for something...

1363
01:22:43,570 --> 01:22:46,368
...and him be so tremendously
uncomfortable beforehand.

1364
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:48,322
When the Kennedy Center came along...

1365
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:53,087
...and offered him something, because
he knew he would just be able...

1366
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:56,003
...to enjoy the evening, he accepted.

1367
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:01,606
I was working with Ginger Rogers...

1368
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:05,206
...on a little one-woman show
that she was gonna do.

1369
01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:09,039
I wrote to Cary and he called me
two days later...

1370
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:11,405
...and all he wanted
to talk about was Ginger.

1371
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:14,164
I then felt comfortable enough
to say to Cary:

1372
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:16,890
"I would love to represent you
for something like this."

1373
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:19,689
And he said, "No, I'm retired,
I don't give speeches...

1374
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:21,727
...and I don't wanna do any of this."

1375
01:23:22,650 --> 01:23:24,845
<i>After a year and a half</i>
<i>of prodding...</i>

1376
01:23:25,010 --> 01:23:27,922
<i>... Grant finally agrees to appear</i>
<i>before an audience</i>...

1377
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:31,127
...<i>in</i> An Evening With Cary Grant.

1378
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:34,049
I was very surprised.
Yes, I didn't think he would do it...

1379
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:39,648
...because he had, to a certain extent,
retired from public life at that stage.

1380
01:23:39,810 --> 01:23:45,567
His only stipulation was that
no seat cost more than $25.

1381
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:48,360
<i>Grant returns to his roots...</i>

1382
01:23:48,530 --> 01:23:54,287
<i>... appearing in theaters he had played</i>
<i>on the vaudeville circuit 60 years earlier.</i>

1383
01:23:54,450 --> 01:23:57,920
It was wonderful, really quite
extraordinary, to see the adoration...

1384
01:23:58,090 --> 01:24:01,969
...of the audience, whether they were
male, whether they were female...

1385
01:24:02,130 --> 01:24:04,724
...whether they were old
or whether they were young.

1386
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:07,848
They were just thrilled
to have Cary there.

1387
01:24:08,450 --> 01:24:11,999
He got a big, big kick out of doing that,
questions and answers.

1388
01:24:12,170 --> 01:24:14,445
People, they would...

1389
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:18,125
Lovely ladies with blue rinses were
sitting there in front in the audience...

1390
01:24:18,290 --> 01:24:23,523
...and on he walks, looking absolutely
spectacular, as he always did.

1391
01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:25,806
And they just loved it, you know?

1392
01:24:25,970 --> 01:24:28,006
The legend actually came to life.

1393
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:33,403
He did come full circle.
There's no question about it.

1394
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:38,400
He began in the provinces
and he ended up in the provinces.

1395
01:24:38,610 --> 01:24:41,078
<i>On November the 29th, 1986...</i>

1396
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:44,208
<i>... Grant is scheduled</i>
<i>to perform in Davenport, Iowa.</i>

1397
01:24:44,410 --> 01:24:47,846
That morning, he'd been in great form.
We had been walking around...

1398
01:24:48,010 --> 01:24:51,764
...and joking and having a wonderful
time, and it was only that afternoon...

1399
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:54,490
...when he was doing the rehearsal,
that I understood...

1400
01:24:54,650 --> 01:24:57,483
...that something was going wrong,
because he could not focus.

1401
01:24:57,770 --> 01:25:04,164
<i>Grant is taken to the hospital where he</i>
<i>dies of a massive stroke at 11:22 p.m.</i>

1402
01:25:04,330 --> 01:25:07,447
He could've died in his bed at home.
He could've died anywhere...

1403
01:25:07,650 --> 01:25:10,801
...but he was on the road
doing something that he loved to do.

1404
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:15,561
<i>Director Billy Wilder and his wife</i>
<i>Audrey sum up the collective feeling...</i>

1405
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:17,960
<i>... in their telegram to Barbara.</i>

1406
01:25:18,130 --> 01:25:22,043
<i>"The model is gone.</i>
<i>Who can we emulate now?"</i>

1407
01:25:23,370 --> 01:25:26,726
"I spent the greater part of my life
fluctuating between Archie Leach...

1408
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:30,360
...and Cary Grant,
unsure of either, suspecting each."

1409
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:37,449
He invented himself
to be Cary Grant...

1410
01:25:37,610 --> 01:25:41,239
...and then had to play the role
of Cary Grant both on- and off-screen.

1411
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:44,487
The last man who said that to me
was Archie Leach, a week before...

1412
01:25:44,650 --> 01:25:45,878
- Is that so?
- That so?

1413
01:25:46,050 --> 01:25:48,689
We've been in worse jams
than this, haven't we, Hildy?

1414
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:51,245
But it was an amazing thing
to build that persona.

1415
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:55,125
He was big on inventing
life for himself.

1416
01:25:55,290 --> 01:25:57,042
That's what made him
so magnetic to me.

1417
01:25:57,210 --> 01:26:01,886
That immeasurable amount
of sheer confidence.

1418
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:03,682
May I kiss you? Thank you.

1419
01:26:03,890 --> 01:26:06,768
I don't think Cary Grant
started out to be an artist.

1420
01:26:06,970 --> 01:26:13,569
I think, along the way, he realized
he had to perfect what it was he did...

1421
01:26:13,770 --> 01:26:16,807
...and actually became an artist.

1422
01:26:18,690 --> 01:26:24,128
Who is going to follow Cary Grant?
So far, <i>nada.</i>

1423
01:26:24,570 --> 01:26:27,368
I won't trouble you any more tonight.

1424
01:26:28,530 --> 01:26:29,929
Good night.
