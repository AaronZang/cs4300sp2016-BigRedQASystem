2
00:00:56,751 --> 00:00:58,751
Father,

3
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:04,881
another one.

4
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,541
... it can no longer walk.

5
00:01:48,336 --> 00:01:50,336
Do you see? Here you are.

6
00:01:51,568 --> 00:01:53,568
It has been very easy .

7
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,963
Look, son, listen:

8
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:07,954
I'll  leave this pot  on your night table,

9
00:02:08,054 --> 00:02:10,479
and every day, before going to sleep,

10
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:13,146
you will tell him good night, and when you raise,

11
00:02:13,246 --> 00:02:15,040
you will tell him good morning.

12
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,024
The continued contemplation of any thing that makes you feel repulsion

13
00:02:19,124 --> 00:02:21,391
makes you get to feel it closer

14
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:23,479
and helps you surpass the fear you feel for it.

15
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:30,312
Next time you find any other cockroach, you will remember your friend, and you'll no longer feel revulsion for it .

16
00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:06,529
Good morning.

17
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:15,594
Good night.

18
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:32,247
Pacheco!

19
00:03:32,347 --> 00:03:35,480
Pacheco, I've seen some snakes in the pigeon house!

20
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:52,856
Good night, snails, have rest, you need it very much.

21
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:03,016
See you tomorrow, toad.

22
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:19,398
Calm, shut up, shut up !

23
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:22,431
Keep quiet !

24
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:36,222
Come in, Pacheco, come in,

25
00:05:36,322 --> 00:05:40,855
today you've missed the introduction of your new companion: Irene.

26
00:06:05,822 --> 00:06:08,622
I won't say it again.

27
00:06:08,722 --> 00:06:14,082
You decide how to manage it, but I do not want you to keep on turning the house into a vermins's nursery.

28
00:06:14,182 --> 00:06:19,545
You have this week to get rid of the pots if you don't want me to throw them into the well, have you heard me?

29
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:24,112
The forest is large and there you have plenty of space to do whatever you want .

30
00:07:24,337 --> 00:07:26,337
Hello!

31
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:29,669
What do you hide there inside?

32
00:07:32,358 --> 00:07:34,358
Hey, what's going on?

33
00:07:34,617 --> 00:07:36,617
Are you afraid of me?

34
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:41,733
Follow me.

35
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:15,689
Pacheco!

36
00:08:55,456 --> 00:08:57,456
Good night, chick.

37
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,870
Rest, water vermin.

38
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:14,384
Good-bye, spider.

39
00:09:14,893 --> 00:09:17,493
Have sweets dreams, little fishes.

40
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:20,189
Enjoy your meal, worms.

41
00:09:21,446 --> 00:09:24,513
See you tomorrow, crawfish, have rest .

42
00:10:13,228 --> 00:10:15,228
Good night, girl.

43
00:10:21,348 --> 00:10:23,348
See you tomorrow, have rest .

44
00:10:24,305 --> 00:10:30,824
