<i>In London, the deaIers set</i>

00:00:21,134 --> 00:00:23,659
<i>at</i> $<i>42. 72 an ounce.</i>

4
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:26,598
<i>Up 15 cents from Monday's officiaI price.</i>

5
00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:43,453
<i>In the foreign exchange markets,</i>

00:02:25,258 --> 00:02:28,523
<i>Attention, emergency caII for PETER 12</i>

13
00:02:43,076 --> 00:02:45,909
<i>12, you and the Ieading vehicIe. Come in.</i>

14
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:21,996
Very good. Less than three minutes.
And that's through heavy traffic.

15
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:23,831
Captain, congratulations.

16
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:27,737
You gentlemen know in the United States,
in just 10 years

17
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:31,504
while house robberies have gone up 133%
and street robberies 186% ,

18
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:34,373
bank robberies have gone up 296% .

19
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:37,917
As a matter of fact, there's an embezzlement,
larceny, or bank robbery

20
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:41,044
every 30 minutes, five days a week,
52 weeks out of the year.

21
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:44,352
But the problem for you gentlemen
is the thing seems to be moving this way.

22
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:48,190
And very soon that shocking condition
may prevail soon right here in Hamburg.

23
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:50,161
But it's not gonna happen in this bank.

24
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,028
Mr. Kessel, how long has it taken me
to install this system?

25
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:54,293
Almost a year.

26
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:58,428
l am proud to say we have now the
same protection as our American branches.

27
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,169
Bulletproof glass. Same as before.

28
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:05,769
Television, closed circuit, 24 hours a day.

29
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:08,211
Checks can be cashed only at this window.

30
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:11,478
Would you bounce a check
while you're being photographed?

31
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:15,882
lf someone is foolish enough to stage
a hold-up, give them the money.

32
00:06:15,955 --> 00:06:17,547
Mr. Kessel.

33
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:19,285
No heroes.

34
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:23,795
Nobody has to risk his life,
or even the customer's.

35
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:26,889
The alarm rings automatically.

36
00:06:32,706 --> 00:06:34,264
Karl.

37
00:06:36,276 --> 00:06:40,576
Armed guards. Young.
They hit what they shoot at.

38
00:06:41,948 --> 00:06:44,178
Professional crooks always case a bank,

39
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,378
learn the layout, the routine,
what happens hour by hour.

40
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:50,912
The only routine in this bank
is that there's ''no routine.''

41
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,324
Now, these vaults have time locks,
three clocks working in unison.

42
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:58,654
This type of lock
has never been cracked yet.

43
00:06:58,732 --> 00:07:02,634
This door, eight inches of tempered steel,
$50,000 each.

44
00:07:02,702 --> 00:07:06,194
Now, here are some of the tools
that have made your insurance rates go up.

45
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:10,231
Power drill, nitroglycerine, burning bar.
That bar costs $7.

46
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,768
lt'll burn through that door in one minute
or that wall in two minutes,

47
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:15,405
but it won't happen for two reasons.

48
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:18,315
That camera and this new sonic alarm.
Mr. Kessel.

49
00:07:21,421 --> 00:07:24,413
Now, with 16 million safety deposit boxes
in the United States,

50
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:26,891
why are Americans
coming here to rent them?

51
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,863
Because, in America, the police can open
any box with a court order.

52
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:36,659
But here in Hamburg, as in Hong Kong,
Tangiers, Switzerland, among others,

53
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:39,227
the banking laws
keep these boxes absolutely private.

54
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:41,000
lf you gentlemen want their business,

55
00:07:41,074 --> 00:07:43,599
you've got to give these people
maximum security.

56
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:45,803
And this thing never sleeps.

57
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,537
Day and night,
it makes sure all these secrets are safe.

58
00:07:49,716 --> 00:07:51,183
Even from the bank itself.

59
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:53,008
Good morning.

60
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,456
<i>FIight 794 to BerIin. Waiting room B Gate.</i>

61
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,089
-Hello.
-Hi.

62
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:08,696
-Hi.
<i>-I'm here.</i>

63
00:08:08,768 --> 00:08:12,204
-Yeah, so...
<i>-Yeah, I just got in.</i>

64
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:14,763
-How are you?
<i>-I'm fine. Are you aII right?</i>

65
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:18,210
<i>-You free this afternoon?</i>
-Yeah.

66
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:20,246
<i>-I'II caII you Iater.</i>
-Great.

67
00:08:20,313 --> 00:08:21,746
Great. What time?

68
00:08:21,815 --> 00:08:24,750
<i>-When I'm finished.</i>
-Right-O. Bye.

69
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:28,285
When they asked Willie Sutton,

70
00:08:28,388 --> 00:08:30,379
America's famous bank robber,

71
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:36,126
''Why do you keep robbing banks
when you keep getting caught?''

72
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:38,328
His answer was,

73
00:08:38,798 --> 00:08:40,823
'''Cause the banks are where the money is.''

74
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,026
Mr. Collins.

75
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:45,904
-Yeah?
-lt's me. Ready?

76
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:49,105
The Army was just here and left.

77
00:08:50,577 --> 00:08:52,807
Las Vegas just got into town.

78
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,272
Thank you.

79
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:58,473
-To the perfect bank.
-To bank robbers.

80
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:01,916
lf we didn't have thieves,
we wouldn't need banks.

81
00:09:06,226 --> 00:09:06,526
Two hundred and eighty carton Hershey bar.

82
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:08,187
Two hundred and eighty carton Hershey bar.

83
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:09,353
Check.

84
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:11,795
-Three hundred paratrooper boot.

85

00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:22,504

-Forty two thousand frozen turkey.
-Check.

91
00:09:27,814 --> 00:09:29,805
Next time, bring dollars, okay?

92
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,339
See you.

93
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,264
You're late.

94
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,532
-Won't that keep till later?
-Nope.

95
00:09:58,878 --> 00:10:01,346
l've been in and out of trains all night.

96
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:03,609
You're breaking my heart.

97
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:07,680
Come on, Sarge,
we've got all day to get to the bank.

98
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:09,779
There's nothing here from that outfit,

99
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:12,484
the one that sends them
lousy-looking hookers.

100
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:15,221
She said no more kickbacks.

101
00:10:15,695 --> 00:10:18,061
-Just like that?
-That's what she said.

102
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:20,923
And what'd you say?

103
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:29,674
Stupid brass chicken-shit!

104
00:10:30,143 --> 00:10:34,375
You just tell that little bitch we book no
more of her acts in any of our service clubs.

105
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:36,938
Not Frankfurt. Not Vietnam. No place.

106
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:40,281
No pay, no play. You just tell her that.

107
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:43,004
Good morning.

108
00:11:54,794 --> 00:11:56,853
<i>Good morning, Mr. North.</i>

109
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:14,703
Take that burning bar out of there, please.

110
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:16,806
<i>I'd Iike to caII Las Vegas.</i>

111
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:18,475
<i>Yeah. CoIIect.</i>

112
00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:26,916
Yeah.

113
00:12:28,227 --> 00:12:32,163
That's right.
Same party and number we called last week.

114
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:04,260
Hello? Yeah.

115
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,064
Yes, everything okay this end.

116
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:14,339
Hold it. Counselor.

117
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:21,871
Yes?

118
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:26,017
Well, l can be in Monte Carlo tonight.

119
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:32,214
<i>If the proposition is suitabIe.</i>

120
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,291
<i>There's enough cash right here to cover it.</i>

121
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:12,897
l can't hear a word.

122
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:14,892
Hello?

123
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:38,480
Excuse me.

124
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,291
So much to eat for such a little girl.

125
00:14:44,363 --> 00:14:47,025
-l've got no will-power.
-Good.

126
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:51,502
So, twice a week, first shopping,
and then business with my private box.

127
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:57,106
l would give anything
to see your private box.

128
00:14:59,212 --> 00:15:03,512
Mr. Kessel, all boxes are the same.
You know that.

129
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:06,616
Only some boxes are big
and some are small.

130
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:31,171
-Miss Divine, your key.
-Thank you.

131
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:04,099
Hey, what you doing here?

132
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:06,538
Robbing the bank.

133
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:11,436
You were supposed to be following him.

134
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,479
-Does he know you work here?
-No.

135
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:28,392
<i>Yes, I wiII caII again.</i>

136
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:32,493
You gave him the money?

137
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:35,132
No trouble?

138
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,130
Last week, you made
a connection in Marseilles.

139
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:41,366
Heroin.

140
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:44,307
You brought back six kilos.

141
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:49,404
How did you get it through customs?

142
00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:54,985
Please.

143
00:17:57,323 --> 00:17:58,847
No excitement.

144
00:18:03,162 --> 00:18:05,596
Can you get this into Copenhagen?

145
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:08,523
-What is it?
-Acid.

146
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:10,625
From one ounce

147
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:15,299
they will make 300,000 capsules of LSD.

148
00:18:16,342 --> 00:18:19,004
lf you put this in the water supply,

149
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:22,578
all of Hamburg takes a trip.

150
00:18:25,284 --> 00:18:26,876
Deliver to him.

151
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:30,721
Two bottles.

152
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:35,125
$1 40,000. Cash.

153
00:18:36,162 --> 00:18:38,722
Bring it here. To me. Tomorrow.

154
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:40,288
What's my end?

155
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:42,928
Yes.

156
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:57,048
-My boy will go with you to Copenhagen.
-l don't go with boys.

157
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:00,813

Okay.

177
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:16,529
Fire!

178
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:24,331
Four-alarm fire! Break out the nets!

179

Save me. Put me out.

Burn, baby, burn.

Put me out.

182

For that he pays you $100, huh?

183
00:25:26,905 --> 00:25:28,167
$200.

184
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:30,070
lt takes all kinds.

185
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:32,541
One old gentleman gets very young

186
00:25:32,611 --> 00:25:35,978
when l wear a black garter belt
and yellow stockings.

187
00:25:36,682 --> 00:25:39,014
Don't you ever take
your clothes off to do it?

188
00:25:39,084 --> 00:25:40,949
You're so square.

189
00:25:41,253 --> 00:25:43,721
You are a victim of the Establishment.

190
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:46,257
-You're not?
-Don't be silly.

191

l'm for smoking and drinking,

193
00:25:50,996 --> 00:25:53,021
and infidelity and money and l go to church.

194
00:25:53,098 --> 00:25:56,124
These guys are the Establishment,
hidden money, big money.

195
00:25:56,201 --> 00:25:57,896
That's the Establishment. Right there.

196
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,835
You're not one of them, you work for them.

197
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:04,103
Everybody. Judges, lawyers, politicians,
even the banks, they work for them.

198
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:06,167
All of us, we're all working for them.

199
00:26:06,245 --> 00:26:08,975
-My God.
-Him, l don't know about yet.

200
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:10,412
But l can tell you one thing...

201
00:26:10,482 --> 00:26:13,576
your fire chief friend there
is about to empty his cash box.

202
00:26:13,652 --> 00:26:17,486
And that means we can't wait.
So, him, you gotta find out about tonight.

203
00:26:17,556 --> 00:26:19,786
You think one night
in Copenhagen is gonna...

204
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:21,826
Maybe there's nothing to find out about him.

205
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:23,987
With him or without him, we go tomorrow.

206
00:26:24,062 --> 00:26:27,259
Terrific. Rob one, rob them all!

207
00:26:27,566 --> 00:26:29,659
Rob the bank. Rob all the banks.

208
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:32,295
-Hello. Wait a minute.
-Right on. Revolution. Woodstock.

-You finished?
-Ho Chi Minh and a bottle of gin.

Oops. Power to the people.

211
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:38,941
-You finished?
-Finished.

212
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:42,538
Look, just one time,
if you could, please, just get it straight.

213
00:26:42,614 --> 00:26:44,377
l love it straight.

214
00:26:45,817 --> 00:26:50,015
We're not robbing the bank. Right?
We're not robbing the bank.

215
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:53,250
We're just gonna take what's in here.

216
00:26:53,325 --> 00:26:56,726
Mr. Las Vegas' box,
that's skimmed money to cheat on taxes.

217
00:26:56,795 --> 00:27:00,322
Mr. Army box's here, that's kickbacks
and bribes and black market money,

218
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:04,631
and then we're gonna put it into here.
That's your box right there.

219
00:27:04,703 --> 00:27:08,400
And also Mr. Sunglasses,
but only if he's crooked, right?

220
00:27:08,473 --> 00:27:09,701
-Right.
-Why?

221
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:13,074
Because you may not always be right,
but you're never wrong.

222
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:15,870
-We can't steal any honest money. Right?
-Right.

223
00:27:15,948 --> 00:27:17,973
-But why?
-Wrong?

224
00:27:19,251 --> 00:27:21,549
-lf he's breaking the law...
-He's a crook.

225
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,451
-And?
-And crooks can't holler cop.

226
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:24,750
Right.

-Okay.

Baseball.

251
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,866
The great frigging American pastime.

252
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:55,572
A big league ball weighs five ounces.

253
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:59,208
lnside that thing,
you can pack four ounces of Big Daddy.

-Pure genius.

00:34:42,093 --> 00:34:43,526
Very unusual.

269

Now, Miss, you may undress here,
or you may do it in jail.

Why me?

279
00:36:52,457 --> 00:36:54,322
All l brought in was champagne.

280
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:56,417
A tip from Hamburg says no.

281
00:36:56,494 --> 00:36:58,621
When did they pass a law against these?

282
00:36:58,696 --> 00:37:00,425
And the panties, please.

283
00:37:00,498 --> 00:37:02,830
Now, what could l hide in there?

284
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:07,127
Do you know about these?

285
00:37:07,572 --> 00:37:09,130
Never use them.

286
00:37:09,274 --> 00:37:12,209
Women hide them, you know,
inside themselves.

287
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:17,848
They fill them
with heroin, marijuana, cocaine, pills.

288
00:37:19,684 --> 00:37:22,278
Now, bend over, and spread your legs.

289
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:24,149
Please.

290
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,459
Oh, my God!

292

<i>because I'm reaIIy bugged.</i>

<i>And then this dyke that smeIIs Iike...</i>

296
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:52,873
Oh, that's terrible.

297

298
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,889
Yeah, look, just forget about him.
There's an 1 1 :10 plane back here...

299
00:38:00,525 --> 00:38:02,993
Be on it, huh? All right.

300
00:38:24,015 --> 00:38:26,916
-He could've killed me, too, you know.
-That's right.

301
00:38:26,985 --> 00:38:29,112
-l hate him.
-Waste of time.

302
00:38:29,454 --> 00:38:31,081
l don't care. l could kill him.

303
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:33,783
Stealing is a business, not a crusade.

304
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:35,625
What time do you phone the bank?

305
00:38:35,693 --> 00:38:37,684
You know that junkie
even stole my champagne.

306
00:38:37,762 --> 00:38:40,253
-What time?
-Five minutes before the bank closes.

307
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:43,425
At 3:55. Not before and not after.
Who do you ask for?

308
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:46,902
-l might be ignorant, but l'm not stupid.
-Did l say you were stupid?

309
00:38:46,971 --> 00:38:48,768
-l'm not even sure you're ignorant.
-l am.

310
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,000
You ask for Mr. Kessel.

311
00:38:50,074 --> 00:38:51,905
-And only Mr. Kessel.
-And nobody else.

312
00:38:51,976 --> 00:38:53,068
But l'm not stupid.

313
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:54,702
He's not gonna try to be a hero.

314
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:56,406
He's gonna do
exactly what you tell him to do.

315
00:38:56,481 --> 00:38:58,608
-And what about the way you talk?
-l whisper.

316
00:38:58,683 --> 00:39:01,117
Right, because nobody
can recognize a whisper.

317
00:39:01,185 --> 00:39:03,415
Until this is over, no booze.

318
00:39:03,488 --> 00:39:06,082
No grass, no pills, and no men.

319
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:08,388
You know,

320
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:12,555
every big crime is supposed to prove
something about the times we live in.

321
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:15,326
-What are we proving?
-Nothing.

322
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,191
Has anything like this
ever been done before?

323
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:19,998
Never.

324
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:22,632
You know, there's a thousand ways
to rob a place.

325
00:39:22,707 --> 00:39:26,143
And the company l work for, they know
every one of them. Every one of them!

326
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:31,147
They got statistics on burglars, embezzlers,
car thieves, shoplifters, pickpockets.

327
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:35,376
They got it all broken down
by race, religion, age, sex, politics.

328
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:37,318
They know about stealing by day, by night.

329
00:39:37,388 --> 00:39:39,549
They know about the convicts
and the ex-convicts.

330
00:39:39,624 --> 00:39:42,821
They know about stealing
by doctors and nurses and janitors

331
00:39:42,894 --> 00:39:46,421
and patients stealing blankets and sheets
and pillow cases and bandages.

332
00:39:46,497 --> 00:39:49,557
They know about working men
and businessmen and professional men.

333
00:39:49,634 --> 00:39:50,794
All the respectable people,

334
00:39:50,868 --> 00:39:52,233
the first ones who're gonna
scream law and order.

335
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:55,136
They pad their expense accounts
and they cheat on their taxes,

336
00:39:55,206 --> 00:39:57,674
and they bribe the cops once in a while
and they steal...

337
00:39:57,742 --> 00:40:00,040
They got statistics...
But do you know something?

338
00:40:00,111 --> 00:40:02,944
On all the statistics
on all the banks ever robbed,

339
00:40:03,014 --> 00:40:06,381
there's not one case on record
of a heist like this one.

340
00:40:06,451 --> 00:40:08,078
And that's never.

341
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:10,650
You know, don't you?

342
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:13,487
We're never gonna get away with this.

343
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:15,652
On account of me.

344
00:40:16,761 --> 00:40:18,092
You'll be fine.

345
00:40:18,162 --> 00:40:22,997
-When the time comes...
-l'll freeze and choke and crap out.

346
00:40:23,601 --> 00:40:26,161
You can do it. ln Vegas, you were a natural.

347
00:40:26,237 --> 00:40:29,138
Big deal.
Me and seven other dumb show girls.

348
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:30,731
A feather here, feather there.

349
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:33,242
-But l thought it was terrific.
-Great.

350
00:40:33,311 --> 00:40:37,008
-l got you a test in the movies.
-Sure.

351
00:40:37,682 --> 00:40:41,641
Movie big shot comes in.
He loses $4,000 at the crap table.

352
00:40:41,953 --> 00:40:43,784
So my fire chief says to him,

353
00:40:43,855 --> 00:40:47,484
''Cash, screen test, or a broken leg.
Take your choice.''

354
00:40:49,694 --> 00:40:51,457
Boy, was l excited.

355
00:40:51,996 --> 00:40:54,624
l really was.
l rehearsed for two weeks straight.

356
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:56,997
And l was constipated all the time.

357
00:40:57,668 --> 00:40:59,192
And then D-day.

358
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:02,603
Lights. Camera. Roll them.

359
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,432
''Test. Dawn Divine. Take One. Action.''

360
00:41:09,347 --> 00:41:10,780
And l froze.

361
00:41:12,016 --> 00:41:14,746
l forgot what to do, forgot what to say.

362
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,385
Take two, nothing.

363
00:41:17,455 --> 00:41:19,389
Take three, tears.

364
00:41:19,457 --> 00:41:22,893
Take four, l forgot my own name.

365
00:41:23,294 --> 00:41:25,285
And l made it up myself.

366
00:41:25,696 --> 00:41:27,459
Take five, hiccups.

367
00:41:27,665 --> 00:41:30,065
And the director yells out, ''Cut! Cut!''

368
00:41:30,134 --> 00:41:33,262
He says, ''You go ahead.
You break my leg, you break both of them.

369
00:41:33,337 --> 00:41:37,467
''But the one thing that does not belong
in this girl's mouth is words.''

370
00:41:39,811 --> 00:41:42,405
So get somebody else.

371
00:41:43,481 --> 00:41:45,073
l'm a born loser.

372
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,885
Look, l want you.

373
00:41:51,823 --> 00:41:53,484
But l'm not lucky.

374
00:41:55,526 --> 00:41:58,791
Sometimes, when people
are unlucky by themselves,

375
00:41:58,863 --> 00:42:00,797
they're lucky together.

376
00:42:31,462 --> 00:42:33,953
l know the line's busy, stupid.

377
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:38,896
Find out is she talking
or is the phone out of order?

378
00:42:39,904 --> 00:42:41,166
Operator?

379
00:42:42,273 --> 00:42:44,264
Why the hell don't they learn English?

380
00:43:07,131 --> 00:43:10,066
Ticket to Frankfurt.
The 5,000 for Captain Cooper.

381
00:43:15,172 --> 00:43:16,264
Yes?

382
00:43:17,308 --> 00:43:18,639
No, later.

383
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:23,142
First, l gotta get me a fly boy
to fly the baseballs.

384
00:43:34,892 --> 00:43:38,055
-What's the world coming to?
-Not much, Mr. Kessel.

385
00:43:38,129 --> 00:43:40,427
lngrid, l have a...

386
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:42,423
Thank you, sir.

387
00:43:44,568 --> 00:43:45,933
Not for a day or two.

388
00:43:46,003 --> 00:43:49,530
You have made our lives
very full and very rich.

389
00:43:49,607 --> 00:43:50,869
Likewise.

390
00:43:50,942 --> 00:43:52,807
-May l?
<i>-Oh, naturIich.</i>

391
00:43:55,046 --> 00:43:56,536
lt's personal.

392
00:44:21,872 --> 00:44:24,807
Open up! Out of the sack, bum!

393
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:28,777
This is the goddamn United States Army.

394
00:44:35,186 --> 00:44:37,814
-l've been trying to get you.
-Oh, yeah?

395
00:44:37,888 --> 00:44:41,346
-Your line's been busy all morning.
-l'm disconnected.

396
00:44:42,626 --> 00:44:45,094
-What's matter with you?
-l'm sick.

397
00:44:45,796 --> 00:44:49,562
First place, it ain't your time to be sick.
ln the second place, it don't matter.

398
00:44:49,633 --> 00:44:50,793
Shut up, you fink.

399
00:44:50,868 --> 00:44:53,336
-You're coming with me to Frankfurt.
-Nope.

400
00:44:53,404 --> 00:44:55,531
-Just for one day.
-No.

401
00:44:55,606 --> 00:44:57,335
lt'll do you good.

402
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:01,344
Got no time, so move it.

403
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:02,771
No.

404
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,815
-She's sick.
-Yankee, go home!

405
00:45:04,882 --> 00:45:07,715
That's the trouble with
you American broads. No damn gratitude.

406
00:45:07,785 --> 00:45:08,911
She's not only sick,

407
00:45:08,986 --> 00:45:10,920
<i>she's sick, sick, sick.</i>

408
00:46:02,773 --> 00:46:04,400
<i>HeIIo? Yeah.</i>

409
00:46:06,477 --> 00:46:09,640
<i>Herr</i> Kessel wants you. At once.

410
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:50,578
A safe deposit box
in the name of Mr. North from Las Vegas.

411
00:46:51,188 --> 00:46:53,748
-Box number?
-721 .

412
00:46:54,258 --> 00:46:57,785
They are closing their account,
removing their property.

413
00:46:58,496 --> 00:46:59,986
They will need an escort.

414
00:47:00,064 --> 00:47:02,157
l'm afraid that...

415
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:06,492
lt's a little late
to arrange for an armored truck.

416
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:07,696
No truck.

417
00:47:07,771 --> 00:47:11,969
Everything goes in one suitcase.
Get a couple of guards to Monte Carlo.

418
00:47:12,042 --> 00:47:15,136
-That would be no trouble, l'm sure.
-Except...

419
00:47:16,847 --> 00:47:19,782
lf you could wait until after the bank closes,
by that time...

420
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:20,908
No.

421
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,351
Not today.

422
00:47:24,421 --> 00:47:26,787
lt won't be ready till tomorrow.

423
00:47:27,124 --> 00:47:29,991
ln that case, sir, it's no trouble at all.

424
00:47:30,361 --> 00:47:31,760
None at all.

425
00:47:32,096 --> 00:47:33,563
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

426
00:47:33,898 --> 00:47:37,334
Mr. Kessel, do exactly as l say.

427
00:47:38,335 --> 00:47:40,769
First, you will...

428
00:47:45,976 --> 00:47:48,444
First, you will...

429
00:47:56,053 --> 00:47:57,145
Hello?

430
00:47:57,488 --> 00:47:58,614
Hello?

431
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:00,350
Hello?

432
00:48:01,025 --> 00:48:03,323
l'm having a nervous breakdown.

433
00:48:04,261 --> 00:48:06,126
l forgot how to whisper.

434
00:48:06,197 --> 00:48:09,394
What are you talking about?
You're whispering now.

435
00:48:09,533 --> 00:48:11,660
That is a fantastic whisper.

436
00:48:11,902 --> 00:48:15,303
Yeah, but l can't go through with this.

437
00:48:16,874 --> 00:48:18,466
l can't.

438
00:48:20,611 --> 00:48:23,603
-Maybe tomorrow.
<i>-Look, it's got to be today.</i>

439
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:26,673
<i>Just reIax. There's nothing to worry about.</i>
<i>You just...</i>

440
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,217
Relax.

441
00:48:29,954 --> 00:48:32,548
Make that telephone call in one hour.

442
00:48:33,057 --> 00:48:37,187
Now, set your clock.
The bank time is exactly 2:55.

443
00:48:38,829 --> 00:48:40,524
2:55.

444
00:48:40,598 --> 00:48:43,396
2:55, 2:55.

445
00:48:45,402 --> 00:48:48,496
2:55. l mean, 3:55.

446
00:48:48,572 --> 00:48:49,732
Jesus.

447
00:48:50,975 --> 00:48:52,237
Oh, God.

448
00:48:58,282 --> 00:49:00,648
l am having a nervous breakdown.

449
00:49:22,873 --> 00:49:25,433
Excuse me, excuse me, Mr. Kessel.

450
00:49:25,509 --> 00:49:26,635
l wouldn't do that.

451
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,200
-Do what?
-Go see that girl.

452
00:49:28,279 --> 00:49:32,147
l know she's waiting, but so is that man
across the street. And l don't like it.

453
00:49:32,216 --> 00:49:33,979
A detective? You're positive?

454
00:49:34,051 --> 00:49:36,781
-This time he's got a photographer with him.
-This time?

455
00:49:36,854 --> 00:49:38,913
-Terrible, terrible.
-Not serious.

456
00:49:38,989 --> 00:49:41,457
lf they had proof, they wouldn't be back.

457
00:49:41,525 --> 00:49:43,516
Just forgive me, Mr. Kessel.

458
00:49:43,594 --> 00:49:46,995
A friendly word of advice.
Today, don't leave your desk.

459
00:49:47,064 --> 00:49:50,431
And, tonight,
take some flowers home to Mrs. Kessel.

460
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:52,469
Yeah, thank you.

461
00:49:59,276 --> 00:50:01,267
Servco Export lmport.

462
00:50:01,512 --> 00:50:03,605
<i>-It's me.</i>
-Hi.

463
00:50:04,214 --> 00:50:06,182
<i>-Got your key to the box?</i>
-Yeah.

464
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:10,284
Okay. Draw 40,000.
Get in touch with the Candy Man.

465
00:50:10,754 --> 00:50:12,847
Tell him we got a ball game.

466
00:50:12,923 --> 00:50:15,619
<i>You better hustIe before the bank cIoses.</i>

467
00:50:25,736 --> 00:50:27,294
-Anybody in the booths?
-No.

468
00:50:27,371 --> 00:50:29,100
How about in there?

469
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,331
Keep everybody out of here till closing time.
That's everybody.

470
00:50:32,409 --> 00:50:34,206
l spotted a man in the lobby.

471
00:50:34,278 --> 00:50:37,179
He's got bushy eyebrows, a scar.
He's carrying a flight bag.

472
00:50:37,247 --> 00:50:39,272
He came in and he went out.
ln and out, twice.

473
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:42,376
-He's just hanging around. Just waiting.
-Waiting?

474
00:50:42,453 --> 00:50:44,683
lt's probably nothing, but you never know.

475
00:50:44,755 --> 00:50:46,245
You stay here.

476
00:50:59,169 --> 00:51:01,467
<i>PIease. Change.</i>

477
00:51:08,178 --> 00:51:09,372
Hello?

478
00:51:11,248 --> 00:51:12,374
Mr. Kessel?

479
00:51:12,449 --> 00:51:14,110
-What?
-Your wife.

480
00:51:18,188 --> 00:51:21,419
<i>I am sorry, Mrs. KesseI,</i>
<i>I cannot disturb him.</i>

481
00:51:44,548 --> 00:51:45,810
Mr...

482
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,579
Mr. Kessel, please.

483
00:52:07,671 --> 00:52:08,831
Hello?

484
00:52:08,939 --> 00:52:10,406
<i>Who is there, pIease?</i>

485
00:52:10,474 --> 00:52:11,873
<i>One moment, pIease.</i>

486
00:52:11,942 --> 00:52:13,170
Herr <i>KesseI.</i>

487
00:52:13,243 --> 00:52:15,074
<i>-It is for you.</i>
<i>-Who is it?</i>

488
00:52:15,145 --> 00:52:17,841
<i>I do not know, the Iady speaks EngIish.</i>

489
00:52:18,715 --> 00:52:20,239
Kessel speaking.

490
00:52:20,317 --> 00:52:22,342
There's a bomb in your bank.

491
00:52:22,853 --> 00:52:24,821
<i>Speak up, pIease. Who is this?</i>

492
00:52:25,322 --> 00:52:26,550
A bomb.

493
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:28,419
A bomb, goes boom, boom.

494
00:52:28,492 --> 00:52:29,823
<i>A bomb?</i>

495
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:33,855
Enough dynamite
to blow your bank to pieces.

496
00:52:34,498 --> 00:52:36,261
Now, don't hang up.

497
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:38,233
Don't touch the alarm.

498
00:52:38,368 --> 00:52:42,134
Do exactly what l say. No more, no less.

499
00:52:43,106 --> 00:52:44,505
<i>Don't move.</i>

500
00:52:45,509 --> 00:52:47,340
<i>You're being watched.</i>

501
00:52:49,146 --> 00:52:52,809
<i>Open the bottom drawer of your desk.</i>

502
00:52:54,284 --> 00:52:55,717
<i>Left side.</i>

503
00:53:00,891 --> 00:53:03,951
-Do you see the flight bag?
-Yes, l see it.

504
00:53:04,027 --> 00:53:05,756
Put it on the desk.

505
00:53:07,197 --> 00:53:11,133
And the key to the gold bar, get it.

506
00:53:11,869 --> 00:53:15,965
Put the gold bar inside the flight bag.

507
00:53:19,176 --> 00:53:21,041
Just a moment, please.

508
00:53:24,948 --> 00:53:26,313
Now, listen.

509
00:53:26,383 --> 00:53:30,012
One false move and the bomb explodes.

510
00:53:31,822 --> 00:53:35,258
The guard at the front desk, send him away.
Any place.

511
00:53:36,126 --> 00:53:40,153
A man with a scar
will take the bag and leave.

512
00:53:41,465 --> 00:53:43,092
Do what they say.

513
00:53:45,903 --> 00:53:47,165
Well, go.

514
00:54:00,817 --> 00:54:03,251
Dear God,
l promise l'll always be a good girl.

515
00:54:04,521 --> 00:54:07,285
-The man with a scar.
-Do just what they say, Mr. Kessel.

516
00:54:07,357 --> 00:54:08,654
Go to the vault.

517
00:54:08,725 --> 00:54:10,158
<i>In the vauIt.</i>

518
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:22,161
But the electric eye...

519
00:54:48,932 --> 00:54:50,456
Lock the vault.

520
00:54:51,635 --> 00:54:53,500
The bomb. Hello?

521
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:55,731
<i>Where did you hide the bomb?</i>

522
00:54:58,775 --> 00:55:00,208
<i>Mr. CoIIins?</i>

523
00:55:00,911 --> 00:55:02,742
Clear everybody out of the bank.

524
00:55:02,813 --> 00:55:05,043
<i>Before the bank is cIosing?</i>

525
00:55:05,115 --> 00:55:07,345
<i>Before the bomb is expIoding.</i>

526
00:55:09,052 --> 00:55:12,351
<i>Everybody, pIease Ieave the bank.</i>

527
00:55:12,422 --> 00:55:15,949
<i>PIease Ieave the bank quickIy and orderIy.</i>

528
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,829
<i>Attention for the units 12 and 15.</i>

529
00:55:40,617 --> 00:55:43,745
<i>PIease keep quiet!</i>

530
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,838
<i>Joe.</i>

531
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,308
Bomb squad on the way?

532
00:56:15,385 --> 00:56:16,477
Coming.

533
00:56:16,553 --> 00:56:18,646
That was a brave thing to do, Joe.

534
00:56:18,722 --> 00:56:20,246
Not really, Mr. Kessel.

535
00:56:20,323 --> 00:56:23,121
<i>But the bank is insured.</i>

536
00:56:23,193 --> 00:56:28,062
For any loss over $200,000.
The bank would be responsible for this.

537
00:56:29,232 --> 00:56:31,097
$42,000.

538
00:56:31,168 --> 00:56:35,935
l, Kessel, will personally recommend him
for courage beyond...

539
00:56:38,909 --> 00:56:40,308
What's that?

540
00:56:45,849 --> 00:56:47,077
Ticking.

541
00:56:47,984 --> 00:56:49,281
The bomb.

542
00:56:49,486 --> 00:56:50,976
Joe, the bomb.

543
00:56:51,855 --> 00:56:54,722
<i>It's in there. With you.</i>

544
00:56:55,692 --> 00:56:57,159
<i>I can hear it.</i>

545
00:56:57,627 --> 00:57:00,095
lt's my watch. lt's only my watch.

546
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,300
<i>Come out of there, quick.</i>

547
00:57:05,368 --> 00:57:07,359
-How?
<i>-The key.</i>

548
00:57:07,437 --> 00:57:10,634
<i>-Don't you have the time-Iock key?</i>
-No key.

549
00:57:13,543 --> 00:57:14,737
<i>FrauIein</i> Schmidt!

550
00:57:14,811 --> 00:57:16,938
-Yes, sir?
<i>-The keys!</i>

551
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:19,612
<i>The keys!</i>

552
00:57:20,917 --> 00:57:23,249
Don't worry, sir. l have them.

553
00:57:26,123 --> 00:57:29,456
The key only opens the lock
from inside the vault.

554
00:57:29,526 --> 00:57:31,016
<i>God damn it.</i>

555
00:57:32,195 --> 00:57:36,325
lf you have to stay there
till the time-lock opens in the morning,

556
00:57:36,399 --> 00:57:39,368
maybe, maybe there's not enough air.

557
00:57:39,436 --> 00:57:42,803
But don't worry. And don't breathe fast.

558
00:57:43,406 --> 00:57:45,374
And don't panic!

559
00:57:46,209 --> 00:57:49,042
You, don't let him get excited.

560
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:34,917
<i>PIease Ieave the premises immediateIy.</i>
<i>There is an expIosion hazard.</i>

561
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:39,618
<i>This is the poIice.</i>
<i>PIease Ieave the premises immediateIy.</i>

562
00:58:39,696 --> 00:58:44,395
<i>There is an expIosion hazard.</i>
<i>This is the poIice.</i>

563
00:58:45,302 --> 00:58:48,567
<i>This is the poIice.</i>

564
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:54,101
<i>KesseI here. Is that someone</i>
<i>from the technicaI works agency? Yes?</i>

565
00:58:54,211 --> 00:58:56,543
Burning bar and compressor, we have all.

566
00:58:56,613 --> 00:58:58,774
<i>But quick...</i>

567
01:00:04,114 --> 01:00:07,174
How do you know it wasn't just a hoax,
a practical joke?

568
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,274
So!

569
01:00:09,085 --> 01:00:10,882
-Who put this in my desk?
-Yes?

570
01:00:10,954 --> 01:00:13,354
What of the man
with the scar and bushy eyebrows,

571
01:00:13,423 --> 01:00:14,549
in and out of the bank?

572
01:01:03,807 --> 01:01:06,503
<i>This is the Armed Forces Network</i>
<i>from Munich and Hamburg.</i>

573
01:01:06,576 --> 01:01:09,044
<i>-Were you in the bank just now?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

574
01:01:09,112 --> 01:01:11,842
<i>Have you seen</i>
<i>how the goId bars were stoIen?</i>

575
01:01:11,915 --> 01:01:13,815
<i>WouId you have been afraid?</i>

576
01:01:13,883 --> 01:01:15,407
Have you been in the bank?

577
01:01:15,485 --> 01:01:18,318
No, no, l was on my way in there. No, no.

578
01:01:21,091 --> 01:01:22,615
<i>WouId you go in again?</i>

579
01:01:22,692 --> 01:01:24,091
<i>No, under no circumstances.</i>

580
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,821
<i>You wouIdn't. WouId you go in again?</i>

581
01:01:25,895 --> 01:01:28,125
<i>You wouId not.</i>
<i>Have you been in the bank just now?</i>

582
01:01:28,198 --> 01:01:29,222
<i>Yeah.</i>

583
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,375
<i>He takes the goId bars and I remain here,</i>

584
01:01:45,448 --> 01:01:48,542
<i>compIeteIy unsuspecting</i>
<i>what is happening.</i>

585
01:01:48,618 --> 01:01:50,142
<i>He takes the bars with him,</i>

586
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:52,780
<i>and in a second the poIice wiII shoot me...</i>

587
01:01:52,856 --> 01:01:56,656
<i>and I shouId have discovered...</i>

588
01:02:00,864 --> 01:02:01,888
Good boy.

589
01:02:09,572 --> 01:02:10,732
Mr. Collins?

590
01:02:13,443 --> 01:02:17,038
That noise, like a zither.

591
01:02:17,781 --> 01:02:19,544
<i>You mean this noise?</i>

592
01:02:19,716 --> 01:02:20,978
Yes, sir.

593
01:02:23,453 --> 01:02:25,148
That's a file.

594
01:02:26,756 --> 01:02:29,384
<i>-Who is fiIing?</i>
-l am.

595
01:02:31,461 --> 01:02:33,861
What are you filing, Mr. Collins?

596
01:02:35,298 --> 01:02:38,028
My penknife. The blade needs sharpening.

597
01:02:38,401 --> 01:02:39,459
<i>Why?</i>

598
01:02:40,603 --> 01:02:42,332
lt's not sharp.

599
01:03:09,265 --> 01:03:10,254
Joe!

600
01:03:10,366 --> 01:03:13,301
-l have good news, Joe.
<i>-You found the bomb?</i>

601
01:03:13,369 --> 01:03:14,393
Not yet.

602
01:03:14,471 --> 01:03:17,201
They think maybe it was a false alarm.

603
01:03:17,874 --> 01:03:20,968
As long as the cash
and this gold bar are secure,

604
01:03:21,044 --> 01:03:23,410
and they are.
As long as the vaults are locked,

605
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,744
the only person that would
explode a bomb in here

606
01:03:25,815 --> 01:03:27,180
would be a lunatic or an amateur,

607
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:28,842
and this is a job of a professional.

608
01:03:28,918 --> 01:03:31,910
And suppose there's not enough air

609
01:03:32,121 --> 01:03:34,089
till the time-lock opens in the morning?

610
01:03:34,157 --> 01:03:35,715
<i>I have it right here.</i>

611
01:03:35,825 --> 01:03:39,192
Look, a man my size,
working under heavy stress,

612
01:03:39,262 --> 01:03:42,254
<i>I wouId use about 2,000 Iiters of air</i>
<i>in an hour.</i>

613
01:03:42,332 --> 01:03:47,269
That would give me more than enough air
for about 1 4 hours.

614
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:50,366
<i>Joe, I'm a man who never forgets.</i>

615
01:03:51,107 --> 01:03:52,165
<i>Friends to the end.</i>

616
01:03:52,242 --> 01:03:55,541
So, we are getting you out now. Any minute.

617
01:03:55,612 --> 01:03:57,807
lt won't be necessary, you know.

618
01:03:57,881 --> 01:04:01,476
<i>But the burning bar, you remember?</i>
<i>The burgIar's tooI.</i>

619
01:04:01,584 --> 01:04:03,484
You can... Wait a minute.

620
01:04:03,553 --> 01:04:06,579
Georg, that door cost $50,000.

621
01:04:06,656 --> 01:04:09,147
What is money compared to humanity?

622
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,787
You think a bank has no feelings?

623
01:04:12,862 --> 01:04:16,298
So, we will burn a hole through the wall

624
01:04:16,366 --> 01:04:19,358
<i>and then we push through the time-Iock key.</i>

625
01:04:19,435 --> 01:04:23,132
Thanks, Georg, you're a good friend,
you're really a good friend.

626
01:04:23,206 --> 01:04:25,037
That's just terrific,

627
01:04:25,108 --> 01:04:27,702
but you're gonna ruin that wall
for no reason.

628
01:04:27,777 --> 01:04:31,679
l think what you got to do
is take a few minutes, sit down, relax,

629
01:04:31,748 --> 01:04:34,308
and just give this thing some thought.

630
01:04:34,851 --> 01:04:37,945
Just take your time, Georg, take your time.

631
01:04:38,021 --> 01:04:41,388
There is no time to take our time.
You are on television, Joe.

632
01:04:41,457 --> 01:04:43,857
Everybody in Hamburg is watching.

633
01:04:44,327 --> 01:04:48,195
And to think how that boy risked his life.
And for what?

634
01:05:26,235 --> 01:05:29,102
<i>Getting cIose in there for you, Mr. CoIIins?</i>

635
01:05:29,172 --> 01:05:31,470
Yeah, well, it's close enough.

636
01:05:51,027 --> 01:05:53,291
How long has the man
been down there, Mr. Kessel?

637
01:05:53,363 --> 01:05:56,355
Please. Just one more thing. Just one thing.

638
01:05:57,266 --> 01:05:58,563
What about the gold bar?

639
01:05:58,635 --> 01:06:00,068
<i>Yes, I cannot.</i>

640
01:06:00,136 --> 01:06:02,604
<i>The man does not have any.</i>
<i>I cannot teII you more.</i>

641
01:06:02,672 --> 01:06:04,333
<i>I do not know either.</i>

642
01:06:04,407 --> 01:06:06,466
<i>Yes, come in.</i>

643
01:06:08,778 --> 01:06:11,246
<i>Yes, I have. I do not have time anymore.</i>

644
01:06:11,314 --> 01:06:13,305
Please, just one thing.

645
01:06:14,817 --> 01:06:16,079
One more thing.

646
01:06:16,152 --> 01:06:18,712
Please, just don't disturb me now.

647
01:06:22,592 --> 01:06:23,957
This wall here.

648
01:06:24,327 --> 01:06:26,386
Any minute now, Mr. Collins.

649
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:38,363
Mr. Kessel, please, this is very important.

650
01:06:57,493 --> 01:06:59,859
Through this wall. This hole.

651
01:07:14,811 --> 01:07:17,905
Hamburg. Yes, l'm at the United World Bank.

652
01:07:18,781 --> 01:07:20,305
That American kid

653
01:07:22,118 --> 01:07:25,679
locked himself inside the vault.
A 1 4-hour time-lock.

654
01:07:25,922 --> 01:07:29,085
That's right.
He's trying to save a $42,000 gold bar.

655
01:09:43,059 --> 01:09:44,321
...State of Nebraska.

656
01:09:44,393 --> 01:09:46,861
<i>Joe CoIIins won the heart of Germany today</i>

657
01:09:46,929 --> 01:09:48,954
<i>with an unseIfish act of bravery.</i>

658
01:09:49,031 --> 01:09:50,862
<i>AII of Hamburg is rooting for Joe CoIIins,</i>

659
01:09:50,933 --> 01:09:53,367
<i>and so is everybody here</i>
<i>at Armed Forces Radio.</i>

660
01:09:53,436 --> 01:09:55,563
<i>Stick with it, Joe. Stick with it.</i>

661
01:11:42,678 --> 01:11:44,578
Joe, can you hear, Joe?

662
01:11:45,881 --> 01:11:47,542
The key is coming.

663
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:53,518
Joe, can you see the key?

664
01:11:54,557 --> 01:11:56,650
Take the key, Joe.

665
01:11:58,728 --> 01:12:00,218
<i>What's he doing?</i>

666
01:12:00,296 --> 01:12:03,060
l can't see. Too much smoke.

667
01:12:05,768 --> 01:12:07,998
Joe, the key, Joe, fell off.

668
01:12:08,671 --> 01:12:11,333
The hole near the door.

669
01:12:12,742 --> 01:12:14,505
Joe, the key.

670
01:12:19,248 --> 01:12:20,374
Joe.

671
01:12:20,649 --> 01:12:23,777
There's something sticky on the end
of this, what is it?

672
01:12:24,887 --> 01:12:26,047
Juicy fruit.

673
01:12:26,122 --> 01:12:27,817
Very good, Georg.

674
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:29,380
Thank you.

675
01:12:29,458 --> 01:12:31,221
Georg, l still can't find the key.

676
01:12:31,293 --> 01:12:34,558
Some times, it happens to money,
it falls in your...

677
01:12:35,364 --> 01:12:37,559
Look in your trousers, on the bottom...

678
01:12:37,867 --> 01:12:40,427
the cuff. Cuff, understand? Cuff.

679
01:12:41,904 --> 01:12:42,962
Joe.

680
01:12:43,606 --> 01:12:46,131
Georg, boy, you're terrific.

681
01:12:46,609 --> 01:12:48,440
l'm coming out, Georg.

682
01:12:48,611 --> 01:12:50,476
Okay.

683
01:12:52,715 --> 01:12:54,979
-Time-lock's ready.
-Yes, sir.

684
01:13:30,052 --> 01:13:31,076
Major.

685
01:13:31,153 --> 01:13:32,643
-Okay?
-Okay.

686
01:13:37,393 --> 01:13:40,419
<i>He says, he came by train.</i>

687
01:13:41,397 --> 01:13:43,194
The place was closed.

688
01:13:43,866 --> 01:13:47,097
Do you expect me to keep $1 40,000 on deck?

689
01:13:48,471 --> 01:13:50,462
<i>He means in the bag.</i>

690
01:13:51,273 --> 01:13:53,366
-Where is it?
-Safe.

691
01:13:55,111 --> 01:13:57,079
Then you haven't got it?

692
01:13:58,180 --> 01:13:59,579
Then get it.

693
01:14:00,716 --> 01:14:02,980
Tomorrow morning, 10:00.

694
01:14:05,688 --> 01:14:08,054
Black boxes in big banks.

695
01:14:08,124 --> 01:14:09,113
Business.

696
01:14:09,191 --> 01:14:13,184
What kind of business is this? Was he paid?

697
01:14:13,362 --> 01:14:15,660
What you gave me, l gave him.

698
01:14:18,467 --> 01:14:20,196
l saw him count it.

699
01:14:21,704 --> 01:14:23,934
The police found nothing.

700
01:14:24,006 --> 01:14:25,906
He must've been robbed.

701
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:29,708
Tomorrow morning. When the bank opens.

702
01:15:18,594 --> 01:15:20,721
No, no, no, no! No!

703
01:15:21,263 --> 01:15:23,493
You said tonight.
Okay. l set it up for tonight.

704
01:15:23,566 --> 01:15:25,227
You said you'd have the money tonight.

705
01:15:25,301 --> 01:15:28,600
You'll get it as soon as the bank opens.
First thing tomorrow. Okay?

706
01:15:28,671 --> 01:15:31,367
Okay. Tomorrow you get the merchandise.

707
01:15:32,007 --> 01:15:34,942
Oh, boy! That is really something.

708
01:15:35,511 --> 01:15:39,174
When a Kraut junkie don't even trust
the United States frigging Army,

709
01:15:39,248 --> 01:15:40,875
that is really something.

710
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:43,748
You. l trusted you. Not him.

711
01:15:45,387 --> 01:15:47,981
l tell you l was there. ln time.

712
01:15:48,357 --> 01:15:51,485
The bank was closed.
l swear it, l couldn't get in.

713
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,687
Here, it's all in the paper.

714
01:15:55,331 --> 01:15:56,923
Hold it, buster.

715
01:15:57,299 --> 01:16:00,530
You don't believe my partner.
l want to know why.

716
01:16:43,078 --> 01:16:44,670
-But can we trust him?
-You worried?

717
01:16:44,747 --> 01:16:46,237
You don't want me to get the 40,000?

718
01:16:46,315 --> 01:16:48,340
l'm worried about
what kind of baseballs we're buying.

719
01:16:48,417 --> 01:16:49,441
Spalding, stupid.

720
01:16:52,254 --> 01:16:54,154
Mr. Collins. Telephone.

721
01:17:00,629 --> 01:17:01,618
Hello?

722
01:17:02,197 --> 01:17:03,221
Now?

723
01:17:03,332 --> 01:17:04,390
No.

724
01:17:05,134 --> 01:17:06,726
lt's crowded.

725
01:17:07,703 --> 01:17:09,330
lt's overcrowded.

726
01:17:09,505 --> 01:17:11,132
Fireworks started, yet?

727
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:13,600
That'll be any minute.

728
01:17:23,052 --> 01:17:24,576
<i>I am sorry.</i>

729
01:17:33,095 --> 01:17:36,292
<i>Has there been a break in?</i>
<i>What has happened?</i>

730
01:17:36,365 --> 01:17:38,265
<i>Nothing.</i>

731
01:17:38,334 --> 01:17:40,063
<i>Has the goId been saved?</i>

732
01:17:40,135 --> 01:17:43,036
<i>It aII went weII. They are aII good peopIe.</i>

733
01:17:43,105 --> 01:17:44,663
<i>Do you think so? ReaIIy?</i>

734
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:47,675
<i>TeII me what happened.</i>

735
01:17:50,913 --> 01:17:55,680
<i>I don't know, did everything go weII?</i>

736
01:17:55,751 --> 01:17:59,312
<i>Do you mean that they got away?</i>

737
01:18:04,626 --> 01:18:05,684
You.

738
01:18:06,929 --> 01:18:09,397
-You the one got locked in?
-Yeah.

739
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:14,500
-They find the bomb?
-lt was a false alarm.

740
01:18:14,703 --> 01:18:16,295
Why'd you do it?

741
01:18:17,206 --> 01:18:18,764
lt really wasn't that dangerous.

742
01:18:18,841 --> 01:18:22,902
l mean the gold bar.
So heavy to carry it so far.

743
01:18:23,379 --> 01:18:25,006
The safest place.

744
01:18:56,211 --> 01:18:58,645
Guess what. The Army's here.

745
01:19:37,953 --> 01:19:38,942
Hey!

746
01:19:41,089 --> 01:19:42,750
Congratulations.

747
01:19:43,292 --> 01:19:47,729
Son, if there's one thing l know,
it's shit from Shinola.

748
01:19:48,397 --> 01:19:52,731
Excuse me, ma'am, but what he done
takes good old American know-how.

749
01:19:53,302 --> 01:19:55,566
That's why we're number one, the greatest.

750
01:19:55,637 --> 01:19:59,903
'Cause we got three things going for us.
God, guts, and get-up-and-go.

751
01:20:11,186 --> 01:20:14,587
Thank you.
Don't go too far, sister. l'm in a hurry.

752
01:20:34,676 --> 01:20:38,442
-Call the police!
-No, no alarm.

753
01:21:01,169 --> 01:21:02,727
Miss Schmidt.

754
01:21:04,373 --> 01:21:08,901
Karl, witness this, will you.
Box 804 is empty.

755
01:21:22,791 --> 01:21:25,885
<i>-Mr. CoIIins.</i>
-Yeah.

756
01:21:26,728 --> 01:21:30,391
<i>-Mr. CoIIins.</i>
-ls something wrong, Karl?

757
01:21:30,465 --> 01:21:32,695
Yes, sir. Come, please.

758
01:22:04,399 --> 01:22:06,663
-Oh, my God.
-What's the matter?

759
01:22:09,271 --> 01:22:11,330
-You all right?
-Oh, yeah.

760
01:22:13,542 --> 01:22:17,569
Do you think there's any connection
between crime and sex?

761
01:22:20,916 --> 01:22:22,440
Right now...

762
01:22:44,306 --> 01:22:47,673
This really turns me on!

763
01:23:01,123 --> 01:23:03,921
-You got a pack of cigarettes?
-Yes, sir.

764
01:23:10,065 --> 01:23:14,559
German... German money. God, l love you.

765
01:23:18,707 --> 01:23:19,833
Okay.

766
01:23:30,018 --> 01:23:33,954
England, Queen Mother.
God bless the Queen.

767
01:23:46,968 --> 01:23:48,959
Just put the box in there.

768
01:23:49,771 --> 01:23:52,638
Yeah, that's fine, right there. Thank you.

769
01:24:31,179 --> 01:24:33,340
-Sir?
-lt's okay, lady.

770
01:24:40,555 --> 01:24:44,389
-Today has been some day.
-Yes, lovely.

771
01:24:49,397 --> 01:24:52,457
$870,000.

772
01:24:53,135 --> 01:24:55,262
lt ain't possible. How?

773
01:24:57,706 --> 01:24:59,571
What do we tell Vegas?

774
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:02,966
Whatever we tell them,
they're not going to believe it.

775
01:25:03,044 --> 01:25:04,534
What do we do?

776
01:25:06,748 --> 01:25:08,272
Start running.

777
01:25:08,884 --> 01:25:10,476
Oh, my God, l...

778
01:25:14,923 --> 01:25:16,982
Jesus, when you can't trust a bank...

779
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:33,730
Just a moment.

780
01:25:40,081 --> 01:25:44,984
-May l help you?
-Thank you. You're so sweet.

781
01:25:46,454 --> 01:25:50,390
-You like fish.
-Fish? Fish? l love fish.

782
01:25:50,625 --> 01:25:55,028
Money doesn't grow in safe-deposit boxes.
Money should be put to work.

783
01:25:55,530 --> 01:26:00,229
lf you would let me,
the bank would take care of you personally.

784
01:26:00,602 --> 01:26:04,561
l thank you. lt's a pleasure doing business
with both of you.

785
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:09,804
-The pleasure's all mine.
-Thank you. Thank you.

786
01:27:23,919 --> 01:27:25,045

01:29:21,102 --> 01:29:22,933
You all right, buddy?

791
01:29:23,638 --> 01:29:26,004
-What you do with it?
-With what?

792
01:29:26,074 --> 01:29:28,838
Sarge! For Christ's sake! You crazy?

793
01:29:31,346 --> 01:29:34,406
Thieving, West Point son of a bitch!

794
01:29:35,383 --> 01:29:37,908
Once, just once. The money.

-Where's the goddamn money?
-He hasn't got it.

796
01:29:46,428 --> 01:29:49,226
You bastard, you stole the money yourself.

797
01:29:50,165 --> 01:29:51,928
My box got hit, too.

798
01:29:52,967 --> 01:29:55,527
-All them boxes?
-Not all.

799
01:29:56,037 --> 01:29:57,265
Only us?

800
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:00,601
People like us.

801
01:30:00,675 --> 01:30:03,940
What the hell have l got to do with you?
You're up shit creek without a paddle.

802
01:30:04,012 --> 01:30:06,446
-You're in the same boat.
-Not me.

803
01:30:06,681 --> 01:30:08,672
Can you go to the police?

804
01:30:12,654 --> 01:30:14,713
-He's right.
-You shut up.

805
01:30:16,157 --> 01:30:17,818
Whoever it was,

806

807
01:30:21,362 --> 01:30:23,125

Okay.

809
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:27,868
You got all the answers.

810
01:30:29,437 --> 01:30:30,461
Who?

811
01:30:37,245 --> 01:30:39,008
When we know how,

812
01:30:40,248 --> 01:30:41,806
we'll know who.

813
01:31:57,692 --> 01:31:58,750
So?

814
01:32:01,629 --> 01:32:04,029
So, she's got a safe deposit box, too.
So what?

815
01:32:04,098 --> 01:32:06,225
Well, look at here.

816
01:32:23,718 --> 01:32:25,583
What are you building?

817
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:28,787
She's a dumb little broad from Baltimore.

818
01:32:29,257 --> 01:32:30,747
Not so dumb.

819
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:34,694
War is terrific business.

820
01:32:34,796 --> 01:32:39,392
''Service clubs. Kickbacks from popcorn,

Hello.

829
01:33:18,506 --> 01:33:21,304
Because l don't believe in coincidence,
that's why.

830
01:33:21,376 --> 01:33:23,742
Once, maybe. Twice, no.

831
01:33:23,911 --> 01:33:26,004
Three times, impossible.

832
01:33:27,915 --> 01:33:29,405
She knows you.

833
01:33:29,851 --> 01:33:31,876
lt was fixed for her to know me.

834
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:34,684
We've both got a box in the bank.

835
01:33:34,789 --> 01:33:36,984
So has she. ln the same bank.

836
01:33:37,759 --> 01:33:40,091
Coincidence? l don't believe it.

837
01:33:40,662 --> 01:33:43,222
And this, l don't believe in heroes, either.

838
01:33:43,298 --> 01:33:45,323
lt's an inside job. Has to be.

839

Anyway, l go to get my baggage, see,
and it ain't here.

840
01:34:13,761 --> 01:34:18,130
Yeah, the stupid mothers
never put it on the plane in Munich.

841
01:34:20,001 --> 01:34:22,060
Listen, and get this,

842
01:34:22,136 --> 01:34:25,162
my address book
is inside the missing suitcase.

843
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:27,064
So, here we are, stuck...

<i>without no way to find our oId army buddy.</i>

845
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:32,738
His number's not listed.

846
01:34:32,814 --> 01:34:34,145
<i>a private number.</i>

847
01:34:34,215 --> 01:34:38,151
No, no, no, you see, l can't phone him, see,
'cause then we can't surprise him.

848
01:34:38,486 --> 01:34:40,545
Yeah, it's a surprise party.

849
01:34:40,621 --> 01:34:42,145

Yeah, that's right. lt's a going away party.
Now, how did you know?

862
01:35:28,703 --> 01:35:30,728
Did he mention his name?

863
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:35,068
No, no, no. You did the right thing.

864
01:35:38,112 --> 01:35:40,706
-You got your passport?
-Yeah.

865
01:35:40,782 --> 01:35:43,842
You've got to leave town from here, now!

866
01:35:48,689 --> 01:35:51,123
Bring this one. Lock it.

l'll have the car downstairs
in a couple of minutes.

Carry the suitcase yourself.

Don't open it, and don't go to sleep
till you get there. l'll meet you there.

First, the money.

How do you know he's got the money?

889
01:54:47,727 --> 01:54:48,887
Stupid.

890
01:56:10,877 --> 01:56:13,471
Up! Up! Real slow.

891
01:56:17,817 --> 01:56:20,012
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

892

Jesus, boy. You work for the bank.

893
01:56:23,256 --> 01:56:25,622
You're supposed to protect their money.

894
01:56:27,460 --> 01:56:29,087
All right. The key.

895
01:56:30,897 --> 01:56:32,262
The key!

896
01:56:32,332 --> 01:56:35,358
-You're not gonna believe this.
-That's right.

-Count it.

-$765,000 worth.
-Shut up.

903
01:57:12,939 --> 01:57:15,965
What do you think l did, lug this goddamn
thing across Germany for the exercise?

904
01:57:16,042 --> 01:57:18,010
Shut up! Let me put this together.

905
01:57:18,078 --> 01:57:21,377
You're heavyweight enough
to pull off a million-dollar caper,

906
01:57:21,448 --> 01:57:24,383
and stupid enough to be taken
by a lightweight hustler?

907
01:57:24,451 --> 01:57:26,510
$1 .5 million, $1 .5 million, Sergeant.

908

Where is she?

909
01:57:27,721 --> 01:57:29,279
-Now?
-Right now.

910
01:57:29,355 --> 01:57:32,290
Looks like she's where the money is,
you know?

911
01:57:32,358 --> 01:57:33,848
l got a proposition for you.

912
01:57:33,927 --> 01:57:35,326
Equal partners.

913
01:57:35,395 --> 01:57:38,228
You take us to the broad, we divide the loot.

914
01:57:38,298 --> 01:57:39,492
Seventy-thirty.

915
01:57:39,566 --> 01:57:43,332
-There's no bubbles in this.
-All right, fifty-fifty, okay?

916
01:57:43,603 --> 01:57:46,197
-Sarge, you know...
-No con.

917
01:57:46,272 --> 01:57:47,762
You know exactly where she is.

918
01:57:47,841 --> 01:57:50,935
You know, l knew where
she was supposed to be,

919
01:57:51,010 --> 01:57:52,910
but if she's smart enough
to take the money...

920
01:57:52,979 --> 01:57:54,105
-Yeah, yeah.
-You think?

921
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:56,512
Why would she go
where you could find her?

922
01:57:56,583 --> 01:57:59,279
Oh, boy. On the other hand,
she's the kind of broad...

923
01:57:59,352 --> 01:58:01,582
Shut up. We go there anyway.

924
02:00:06,379 --> 02:00:09,109
l figured they'd never kill you.

925
02:00:10,717 --> 02:00:13,811
At least not till after
they'd found the money.
