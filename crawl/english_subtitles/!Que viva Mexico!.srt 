00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,150
A Mosfilm Production

3
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:33,150
SERGEJ EISENSTEIN

4
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,160
EDUARD TISSE

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,170
GRIGORY ALEXANDROV

6
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,170
A Masterpiece of
Sergej Michailowitsch Eisenstein

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:56,160
QUE VIVA MEXICO!

8
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,320
Mexico, 1931

9
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,850
Sergej Eisenstein,
the film director.

10
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,900
His assitants:
Eduard Tisse, cameraman...

11
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,940
and me, Grigory Alexandrov,
director.

12
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,630
How did we land
in this amazing country?

13
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,990
Sergej Eisenstein's films
of the 20's...

14
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,690
especially The Battleship Potemkin,
won him renown.

15
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,090
He, and we along with him...

16
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,610
were invited to Hollywood
to make a film.

17
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,220
But Eisenstein didn't see
eye to eye...

18
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,990
with the Hollywood tycoons.

19
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,070
Helped by Upton Sinclair,
the American writer...

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,880
we decided to shoot a film
about Mexico.

21
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,450
But first there was much
we had to learn...

22
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,130
about that country.

23
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,060
The great Mexican painters,
Diego Rivera...

24
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,940
David Siqueiros...

25
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,070
and Jose Orozco...

26
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,270
were our guides and teachers.

27
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,070
We spent two months filming.

28
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,410
We travelled north to south,
east to west...

29
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,730
driving thousands of miles
along rugged roads.

30
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,780
A feature of this land...

31
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,060
struck us as amazing.

32
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,860
A hundred miles meant
the difference between epochs...

33
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,270
separating the pre-Columbian
Mexico...

34
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,840
from that of the time
of the Spanish conquest...

35
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,160
the Mexico of the feudal rule...

36
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,010
from modern Mexico.

37
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,260
Eisenstein felt
that this unusual country...

38
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:23,460
deserved an unusual film and
that Mexico's tragic story...

39
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,390
could be told
without actors or sets.

40
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,230
A script was written...

41
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,440
and we began making
Que Viva Mexico!

42
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,770
Our filming crew...

43
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,010
consisted of only us three.

44
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,890
But we were young.

45
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,060
We were ready to move mountains.

46
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,750
Even so, we did not manage
to complete shooting

47
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,350
or editing the film.

48
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,680
All our reels of film were held up

49
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,440
in Hollywood, where they
had been developed and printed.

50
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,090
Later they landed in the Museum
of Modern Art in New York.

51
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,770
They were turned over to us

52
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,570
only a short time ago...

53
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,260
after nearly half a century
of negociations.

54
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,420
Eisenstein and Tisse

55
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,040
are no longer with us...

56
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,600
but what they did
belongs to the living.

57
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,390
You will see the film...

58
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,120
as Eisenstein conceived it...

59
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,560
and as we planned it.

60
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,860
We do not know
what the great director...

61
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,140
would have done
with the picture today.

62
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,020
But using his script and drawings,

63
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,300
we have tried...

64
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,910
to get as close as possible
to what he had in mind.

65
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,720
The film was to consist
of several parts...

66
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,000
some close to being documentary
and some acted.

67
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,130
On the whole,
it was intended to be...

68
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,890
a colourful film symphony
of Mexico.

69
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,930
QUE VIVA MEXICO!

70
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,890
Prologue

71
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,750
The time in the prologue...

72
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,470
is eternity.

73
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,030
It could all be taking place today...

74
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,650
or have happened 20 years ago...

75
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,970
or even a thousand years ago.

76
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,860
The text is by Eisenstein.
It is read by Pino Locchi.

77
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,800
Stone.

78
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,070
Gods.

79
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,800
People.

80
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,600
A land of sacred ruins
and huge pyramids.

81
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,700
Men and women with the features

82
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,330
of their ancestors.

83
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,830
The pagan temples
of holy cities.

84
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,040
A kingdom of death...

85
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,450
where the past
dominates the present.

86
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,850
And faces like those
hewn in stone-

87
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,700
like those...

88
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,460
of the Mexicans of old.

89
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,040
Symbolic reminder of the past:

90
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,410
a funeral

91
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,680
amidst dead ruins.

92
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,810
In total bondage...

93
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,180
to the idea of death,
of man's physical end.

94
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,890
Tropical Tehuantepec.

95
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,270
Here time flows slowly...

96
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,440
to the accomplishment
of the rustle of the palm fronds.

97
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,140
The way of life
remains unchanged for centuries.

98
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,340
At its dawn,
the world must have been full...

99
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:57,630
of the same regal indolence.

100
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,150
The Sandunga

101
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:40,420
Girls sing the sandunga
as they daydream of the future.

102
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,270
Full of pride
in her youthful beauty.

103
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,120
Concepcion.

104
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,870
Her most cherished dream -
a gold necklace.

105
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:20,640
A dream shared
by every girl in Tehuantepec.

106
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,570
The necklace is her dowry,
her key to marital bliss.

107
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,730
The woman works,
she chooses a husband for herself...

108
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,340
and she brings him
into their new house.

109
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,100
Matriarchate.
Rule by the women.

110
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,480
Here the girls go to work early
and save every copper...

111
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:29,410
to acquire a necklace
of gold coins...

112
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,700
by the time they are 16 or 18.

113
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:30,530
Concepcion needs one more
gold coin - just one -

114
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,340
for her dream to be realized.

115
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,800
May your necklace
bring you happiness!

116
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,540
Abundio, the object
of Concepcion's affection.

117
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,280
Isn't this what you wanted,

118
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,410
Concepcion?

119
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,850
What you dreamed of for so long?

120
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,870
The matter passes into the hands...
of the mothers and matchmakers.

121
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,150
They inspect the dowry.

122
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,350
How many coins in the necklace?

123
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,590
Are they pure gold?

124
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:09,240
The whole population
of Tehuantepec...

125
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,050
takes part in the event.

126
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:32,690
A slow, semi-vegetative
existence.

127
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,300
A way of life...

128
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,540
that has not changed
over the centuries.

129
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,720
As the years go by,
new flowers blossom.

130
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,740
Fiesta

131
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,340
The action of this story is set...

132
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,460
during the Feast of
the Holy Virgin of Guadalupe.

133
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,910
But this is also
an annual reminder...

134
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,350
of Spain's conversion
of Mexico...

135
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,680
into a colony
of bloodshed and suffering.

136
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,610
In the 16th century.

137
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,290
Cortes conquered Mexico

138
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,580
The monks who came with him

139
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,850
wiped out pagan cults...

140
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,020
with fire and sword.

141
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,140
On pyramids once crowned

142
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:12,270
by Aztec and Toltec temples...

143
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,960
the Spaniards erected
Catholic churches...

144
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:20,640
so as not to change
the routes of the pilgrims...

145
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,170
who had been coming there
for thousands of years.

146
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,920
A mystery play, in which
the pilgrims who enact it...

147
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,530
portray the sufferings
of Jesus.

148
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:52,770
Sharp prickles penetrate
the bodies...

149
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,580
of those who make crosses
out of cactus stems...

150
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,110
and, with these tied
on their shoulders...

151
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:05,190
crawl for hours
to the top of the pyramid.

152
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,480
Masks of devils,

153
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,080
pagan gods...

154
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:10,050
and Spanish conquistadors
side by side.

155
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,050
The dance goes on
from dawn to dusk.

156
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,860
Without a pause.
Over and over again...

157
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,470
they repeat the same steps...

158
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,390
in honor of the Holy Virgin.

159
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,990
Or perhaps - who knows -

160
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,440
of a more ancient goddess -

161
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,160
the awesome mother of gods

162
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,040
Then the gory finale,
the bullfight.

163
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,770
Introduced by the Spaniards...

164
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:12,490
and now a national spectacle
of the Mexicans.

165
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:18,620
David Liseaga,
a famous Mexican matador.

166
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,390
His younger brother.

167
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,300
Baronito, a picador.

168
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,920
They call on their mother...

169
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,570
to say good-bye to her...

170
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,250
perhaps for the last time.

171
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,000
Today is a day when the toreros
will kill bulls...

172
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,030
in honor of the Virgin.

173
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:16,010
The chosen queens
of the bullfight.

174
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,510
The razor's edge...

175
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:34,560
between death and victory.

176
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,040
Among the local belles...

177
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,280
Baronito catches sight
of his lady love...

178
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,080
Senora Calderon.

179
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:04,600
What else is there
for the poor picador to do?

180
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:49,640
Mexico, tender and lyrical.
And also cruel.

181
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:06,540
Above the high hacienda walls...

182
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,040
floats a plaintive song.

183
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:14,410
The peons beg the Holy Virgin

184
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,660
to ease their sufferings...
on the day now dawning.

185
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:39,660
The time: the beginning
of the 20th century...

186
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:45,400
during the reign
of dictator Porfirio Diaz.

187
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:55,650
Maguey

188
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,780
Native to the hilly country
of the state of Hidalgo...

189
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:08,310
is a large cactus named maguey.

190
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:12,190
These lands...

191
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,950
are a part
of the Tetlapayac hacienda...

192
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,400
in Llanos de Apam.

193
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:20,210
Their lot, day after day,
is to suck out...

194
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:23,530
the thick juice
from the heart of the cactus.

195
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,530
The juice will ferment
and be ready to drink.

196
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:31,300
The strong, milky white beverage

197
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:33,070
is called pulque.

198
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,960
Sebastian, a peon,
is at work in the fields.

199
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:18,970
His betrothed, Maria,
is brought by her parents.

200
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:41,850
Felicio, Sebastian's
younger brother.

201
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:24,350
The landlords and his friends.

202
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:47,330
Every bride-to-be on the estate
must be shown to the master.

203
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:09,570
The old man's daughter Sara...
arrives with her cousin.

204
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:13,330
A family holiday.

205
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:17,460
The landlord celebrates.

206
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,710
Maria is forgotten.

207
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:18,460
The naive girl is unaware
of what is in store for her.

208
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,070
Fate takes the form
of a drunken guest.

209
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,340
Hatred sparks a plot.

210
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:39,150
Three of his comrades
and Felicio, his brother-

211
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:41,790
They will help him
to take revenge.

212
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:27,140
They want to free Maria.

213
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:24,550
Slumbering Mexico. Enslaved Mexico
Fermenting Mexico

214
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:29,520
And finally, fighting
revolutionary Mexico

215
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:32,560
But that last part
remained undone

216
01:16:33,410 --> 01:16:37,530
The picture's small budget
was used up...

217
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:40,300
and shooting came to an end.

218
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:42,970
We returned home.

219
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:48,620
Soldadera

220
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:51,710
was intended to depict Mexico...

221
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,670
during the uprising of 1910

222
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,600
a country engulfed
in the flames of civil war...

223
01:16:58,810 --> 01:17:01,480
divided into hostile camps...

224
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:06,170
and then united by the victory
of the revolution.

225
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:10,610
The Mexican people at arms...

226
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:14,420
were to be the heroes of this story.

227
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:19,390
Soldaderas are the wives
of soldiers.

228
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:22,910
They broke into villages
and captured provisions...

229
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:27,960
to feed their weary men.

230
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:34,200
The soldaderas were always
beside the men.

231
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:37,330
The soldadera to us
was to have been...

232
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:39,930
a symbol of Mexico itself -

233
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:43,110
a symbol of land
whose people came to realize...

234
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:46,860
that strength lies in unity...

235
01:17:47,070 --> 01:17:48,470
and that they must unite
to fight reaction.

236
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,970
Epilogue

237
01:17:59,010 --> 01:18:01,400
The place. Mexico

238
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:06,170
The time.1931

239
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:09,740
Another holiday,
the Day of the Dead.

240
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:13,270
On this day, November 2 ...
the emblem of death

241
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:16,440
and, above all, skulls...
are everywhere.

242
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:36,810
The day begins
with mourning for the dead.

243
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,760
Revelry in cemeteries,
eating on gravestones...

244
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:26,490
lovemaking in the cemetery shrubbery.

245
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:54,490
From candles and food
in the graveyard...

246
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:57,930
to a rollicking carnival.

247
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,360
The Mexican scorns death.

248
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:19,120
What is more...
the Mexican mocks death.

249
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,740
Chocolate coffins

250
01:20:33,950 --> 01:20:35,380
complete with sugar corpse.

251
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:37,820
And at the day's end,
all this goes...

252
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:42,270
into the bronzed bellies
of Mexican children.

253
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,860
A skull under a minister's
top hat...

254
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:04,800
a fireman's helmet,
a policeman's cap...

255
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,630
a general's cocked hat.

256
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:26,010
Not a cult of death this,
not the stillness of stone...

257
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:30,500
or the awesomeness
of stone idols...

258
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:32,460
No!

259
01:21:33,070 --> 01:21:37,070
But man's triumph over death
through mockery of it.

260
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,770
The masks are removed.

261
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Not sham skulls now
but real ones.

262
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:09,870
The corpses of a doom class.

263
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Whom will we see
behind this mask?

264
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,260
A soldadera's son?

265
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:47,000
One of whose hands
are destined to forge...

266
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:50,500
a truly free Mexico?

267
01:22:55,350 --> 01:23:04,000
QUE VIVA MEXICO!
